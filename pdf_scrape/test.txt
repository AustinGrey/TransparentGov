GFC Academic Planning Committee 10/25/2017 
Page 4 

 
Purpose of the Proposal: To discuss amendments to the GFC Academic Planning Committee (APC) terms of 
reference. 
 
Discussion: 
The Chair led members through the current committee terms of reference. A member suggested that the Deputy 
Provost should be added as a non-voting member. While it was noted that the Deputy Provost can attend as the 
Provost’s delegate, there was general agreement by the committee that the Deputy Provost could be a non-
voting member.  
 
It  was  noted  that  information  technology  was  missing  from  governance,  even  though  IT  impacts  research, 
teaching  and  other  scholarly  activities.    The  Chair  indicated  that  there  are  administrative  committees  that 
discuss IT governance and that further clarity on this item would be developed and brought back to members for 
further discussion. 
 
During  the  discussion  on  the  proposed  move  of  college  programming  from  APC  to  the  GFC  Academic 
Standards  Committee  (ASC),  it  was  noted  that  more  consultation  with  the  Dean  of  Faculté  Saint-Jean  was 
needed. 
 
During  the  discussion,  members  enquired  about  the  role  of  the  member  appointed  by  Chairs’  Council,  the 
difference between administrative committees and governance committees, APC’s role in quality assurance, the 
term “school”, and the manner in which fees and new fees are routed through governance.  
 
The Chair reported that this item would be included on future agendas for further discussion. 
 
8.  Update on the Budget  
 
There were no documents. 
 
Presenter(s): Steven Dew, Chair, and Provost and Vice-President (Academic) 
 
Purpose of the Proposal:  For information/discussion. 
 
Discussion: 
The Chair reported on the recent announcement of an anticipated 4% reduction in base budget allocations for 
2018-19 followed by projected 2.5% reductions for both 2019-20 and 2020-21.  This is based on assumptions of 
no increase to the Campus Alberta Grant or tuition.  Members discussed specific program cuts rather than 
across-the-board cuts as well as the impacts of this on Faculties. 
 
The Chair noted the current structural deficit, previous reliance on investment income for base funds, and cost 
challenges related to external contracts, minimum wage changes, and exchange rates. He also discussed the 
planning framework, the budget model, and multi-year forecasting. The Chair noted that there would be a town 
hall on the planning framework on November 9 and that there would be further discussion on this item at the 
November 8 meeting of APC.
