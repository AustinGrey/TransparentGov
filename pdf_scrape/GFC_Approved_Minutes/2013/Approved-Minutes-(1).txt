3.  Comments from the President  
 
President  and  Chair,  Dr  Indira  Samarasekera,  welcomed  all  to  the  390th  meeting  of  General  Faculties 
Council (GFC) and reported on:

-  The  University  of  Alberta  Budget.    She  briefed members  on  the  timeline  of  events  in  relation  to  the 
institutional  budget,  beginning  with  the  unexpected  announcement  by  the  Provincial  Government  on 
March  7,  2013  of  a  7.3%  cut  in  funding,  adding  that,  following  this  news,  the  University’s 
Comprehensive  Institutional  Plan  (CIP)  was  amended  accordingly  and  reflected  a  request  from  the 
University of Alberta to run a deficit for three years in order to allow adequate time to plan around the 
incurred  substantial  budget  shortfall.    She  reported  that,  despite  earlier  indications  the  Ministry  of 
Enterprise and Advanced Education (EAE) was receptive to the three-year proposal, a letter was sent 
by the Minister of EAE to the University’s Board of Governors stating that the institution would not be 
allowed  to  run  a  deficit  past  2014-2015.    She  reported  that  since  March  7,  2013,  members  of  the 
Senior  Administration  (including  the  Deans)  have  all  been  actively  engaged  in  budget  planning 
activities, including a number of meetings held over the summer months. She noted that there are still 
several unknown factors in regard to the financial health of the institution, including the impact of the 
Voluntary Severance Program (VSP) for all continuing academic staff and  whether the University of 
Alberta  will  be  able  to  assess  inflation  adjustments  to  tuition.    She  stated  that  transparency  has 
remained  a  top  priority and  that  her  Office  will  undertake  a  comprehensive  benchmarking  project to 
ensure  that the  University  of  Alberta  administration  is  the  right  size.    She  concluded  by  stating  that 
although the next few months will be difficult for those at the University of Alberta, excellence will be 
maintained through the outstanding efforts of the students, staff, and faculty at the institution. 

-  Her recent trip to China.  The Premier’s Office had invited her to join Premier Alison Redford on a trip 
to China and that, recognizing the opportunity to represent Alberta post-secondary education as well 
as  the  chance  to  discuss  the  University  of  Alberta’s  challenges  with  the  Premier  in  person,  she 
accepted  the  invitation.    She  noted  that  during  the  trip,  in  addition  to  engaging  the  Premier  on  the 
University’s  challenges  including  improving  access  and  providing  a  quality  student  experience,  she 
presented  at  a  conference  on  investments  in  Alberta,  attended  the  Premier’s  keynote  address, 
participated in a panel discussion, and attended a forum on the future of post-secondary education, 
along with representatives from a number of international universities.  She concluded by reporting that 
a summary of the trip would be posted on her blog shortly. 

 

A member enquired about whether the names of the members of the President’s Academic Governance 
Task Force had been announced.

Discussion: 
Ms  Haggarty-France  welcomed  members  to  the  new  General  Faculties  Council  (GFC)  venue  in  the 
Centennial Centre for Interdisciplinary Science (CCIS), emphasizing her gratitude towards members of the 
Faculty of Science, the Office of the Registrar, Facilities and Operations, and Academic Information and 
Communication  Technologies  (AICT)  for  their  collaboration  and  cooperation  in  selecting  an  appropriate 
new  venue  for  GFC.    She  stated  that  GFC  requires  maximized  engagement  as  the  main  academic 
governing body of the University of Alberta, and she reminded members that it derives its authority and 
powers  from  the  Post-Secondary  Learning  Act  (PSLA),  which  can  be  accessed  through  the  University 
Governance website. 
 
As well, the University Secretary encouraged members to reference the University Governance website for 
meeting  schedules, meeting material,  and  committee-specific  Terms  of Reference.    She  also  noted  that 
she conducts throughout the academic year several free informative “Governance 101” sessions and that 
registration can be completed, as well, on the University Governance website. 
 
Ms  Haggarty-France  concluded  her  remarks  by  thanking  members  for  their  continued  service  and 
commitment towards collegial academic governance at the University of Alberta.

Materials before members are contained in the official meeting file. 
 
Presenters: Martin Ferguson-Pell, Acting Provost and Vice-President (Academic); Debra Pozega Osburn, 
Vice-President (University Relations) 
 
Purpose  of  the  Proposal:  To  review  and  provide  advice  on  the  draft  University  of  Alberta  section  of the 
Letter of Expectation with Enterprise and Advanced Education. This section, along with the Comprehensive 
Academic and Research Institutions (CARI) section, the Campus Alberta section and the Government of 
Alberta section, will form the Letter of Expectation (LOE) between the University of Alberta and the Ministry 
of Enterprise and Advanced Education (EAE). 
 
Discussion: 
Aided  by  a  PowerPoint  presentation,  Dr  Ferguson-Pell  provided  members  with  a  brief  outline  of  the 

General Faculties Council 09/16/2013 
Page 7 

 
contents of the Letter of Expectation (LOE) between the Ministry of Enterprise and Advanced Education 
(EAE) and the University of Alberta, explaining that the three sections that comprise the LOE, are first, the 
Comprehensive Academic and Research Intensive (CARI) institutions section, second, the Campus Alberta 
section, and finally, the section specific to the University of Alberta.  He added that the document requires 
alignment  with  the  University  of  Alberta’s  other  guiding  documents,  including  Dare  to  Deliver,  Dare  to 
Discover, and the Comprehensive Institutional Plan (CIP), and that during the draft phase, comprehensive 
consultation  was  sought  regarding  the  revisions  to  the  LOE,  from  both  input  from  key  groups  at  the 
University of Alberta as well as comments posted on the Colloquy blog and Ideascale. 
 
He reminded members that following their feedback and formal recommendation of the document, the LOE 
would  be  submitted  to  EAE  on  Friday,  September  19,  2013,  and  that  it  would  be  given  back  to  the 
institution for consideration at the Board of Governors meeting of October 18, 2013. 
 
Dr Pozega Osburn added that the level of community engagement in drafting the LOE was comprehensive, 
including  13,000-14,000  online  views  of  the  LOE,  116  specific  comments  gathered  from  Ideascale  and 
Colloquy, and substantial attendance and online participation at the Brown Bag Forum. 
 
During the lengthy ensuing discussion surrounding the LOE, members expressed several comments and 
questions, including, but not limited to:  clarification about the definition of “professor” on the second page 
of the document; that the document seems defensive in tone; how feedback on the previous Memorandum 
of Understanding (MOU) has been incorporated into drafting the LOE; clarification about certain editorial 
changes including the title and deleted paragraph on page one; clarification about the difference between 
the  MOU  and  the  LOE; clarification  about  amendments to  a  previous  section  on  student  participation  in 
governance; clarification about the process of Board of Governors approval of the LOE. 
 
Following  a  brief  discussion  about  amendments  made  to  the  document  at  the  GFC  Academic  Planning 
Committee (APC) meeting of September 11, 2013, as well as confirmation of the appropriate governance 
procedure, Mr Kusmu made a ‘Motion to Amend’ the LOE. 
 
Motion to Amend:  Kusmu/Chelen   
 

THAT  General  Faculties  Council  amend  page  3  of  the  University  of  Alberta  section  of  the  Letter  of 
Expectation (LOE) 2013 to include the words “increased student engagement” within the last bullet point 
of the document.                                                                                                             

 
Mr Bodnar clarified that, as per GFC’s procedural rules, Motions with a five or less vote difference require 
an automatic re-vote, with the results of the second vote being final. 
 
Motion to Amend (Second Vote):  Kusmu/Chelen   
 

THAT  General  Faculties  Council  amend  page  3  of  the  University  of  Alberta  section  of  the  Letter  of 
Expectation (LOE) 2013 to include the words “increased student engagement” within the last bullet point 
of the document.

Leadership Initiative 

 
DISCUSSION ITEMS 
 
7. 
 
Materials before members are contained in the official meeting file. 
 
Presenters:  Indira  Samarasekera,  President  and  Chair,  General  Faculties  Council;  Peter  Meekison, 
Program Advisor, Leadership Initiative, and Distinguished University Professor Emeritus 
 
Purpose of the Proposal: On September 13, 2013, the University of Alberta will announce the development 
of a cross-institutional Leadership Initiative, in partnership with the Banff Centre and with the strong support 
of key community leaders. The planning for the initiative will build upon and bring together already-existing 
academic  and  co-curricular  programming  designed  to  inspire,  educate,  and  mentor  aspiring  student 
leaders  across  all  fields  of  endeavour.  How  precisely  the  programming  for  the  initiative  develops  in  the 
future will depend heavily on the vision and input of the academic community. 
 
Discussion: 
Dr Samarasekera introduced former University of Alberta Vice-President (Academic) Dr Peter Meekison to 
GFC members and welcomed him to Council. 
 
Dr Meekison, during his detailed description of the origins and aims of the ‘Leadership Initiative’, explained 
that  the  original  idea  to  create  a  program  to  educate  the  leaders  of  tomorrow  stemmed  from  a  Deans’ 
Retreat held a few years ago and, at that time, the Dean of Students generated a report on leadership; 
there was, however, no formal follow-up to that report.  He explained that the idea resurfaced following the 
death of former Alberta Premier Peter Lougheed, when his family approached the University of Alberta to 
provide to the institution the gift of his name to, possibly, an initiative in this area.  He noted that, following 
this  proposal from  the  Lougheed family,  the  University  explored  accepting this  honour  and that  this  had 
pre-dated the University’s current budget climate. 
 
He explained that when he was asked to become involved in the project, it was an easy decision, based on 
his positive experiences as a faculty member at the University of Alberta, combined with the outstanding 
legacy of Premier Lougheed for both the Province of Alberta as well as for the University of Alberta.  He 
noted that he was further inspired by the contents of Dare to Discover as he felt the seeds of an initiative 
with regard to leadership were contained within it.  He stated that he, thus, became officially involved with 
the project in the Spring of 2013. 
 
Dr Meekison reported that during his early consultations surrounding this project, he met with the Deans as 
well as students involved in a leadership pilot project within the Alberta School of Business—the students  
shared  with  him  that  their  best  experience  from  that  program  had  been  their  ability  to  learn  from  one 
another.    He  added  that  the  Deans  voiced  concerns  regarding  financing  and  that  it  was  clear  that  the 
project would be required to be self-financed.   
 
He  concluded  by  stating  that  the  creation  of  the  ‘leadership  college’  would  act  as  a  catalyst  for  student 
leadership  and  partnerships  as  well  as  a  unique  educational  opportunity  that  would  immerse  students 
within a transformational educational experience and that this represents an enormous opportunity for the 
institution.    He  added  that  the  project  has  been  recently  introduced  into  the  public  domain  to  generate 

General Faculties Council 09/16/2013 
Page 9 

 
appropriate and thoughtful discussion on its future. 
 
Dr  Samarasekera  commented  that,  despite  being  inundated  with  requests  to  use  Premier  Lougheed’s 
name following his passing, the Lougheed family had chosen the University of Alberta in partnership with 
the  Banff  Centre  to  bear  his  name—this  came  as  a  great  honour  to  the  institutions.    She  stated  that 
Premier  Lougheed  often  reminisced  about  his  time  at  the  University  of  Alberta  and  enjoyed  appearing 
personally to award each year those scholarships offered in his name.  She cautioned, however, that this 
proposal is in its formative stages and will require discussion and input from the community, including GFC, 
in order to be properly developed. 
 
Members expressed comments and questions in relation to this proposal, including, but not limited to:  an 
expression of opposition to the idea of a leadership college, due to what was perceived as the singular and 
passé  theme  of  leadership;  that  a  leadership  college  would  be  a  misuse  of  funds;  that  funds  could  be 
raised to develop curricula across all Faculties  that would benefit all students as opposed to just a few; 
clarification  about  the  role  of  the  Office  of  Advancement  in  selectively  fundraising  for  this  initiative;  that 
expecting  faculty  to  teach  students  of  the  leadership  college  will  negatively  impact  the  greater  student 
population; whether there is evidence to support the claim that a leadership college would strengthen the 
entire University of Alberta community and student population; that money should be applied to existing 
leadership  initiatives;  that  assurance  is  needed  that  this  initiative  will  not  cost  any  additional  money; 
clarification on if, and when, the Board of Governors will be voting on this proposal; concerns about the use 
of land to build the residential building associated with a leadership college; that some faculty members are 
skeptical  about funding as  well  as  the  residential  aspect  of the  proposal;  that there  needs to be  a  clear 
definition  of  ‘leadership’  before  this  project  goes  forward;  clarification  about  how  the  leadership  college 
would link to citizenship and engagement; clarification about the diversity of opinions offered by the Deans 
during  early  consultation;  that  the  various  themes  within  the  proposed  description  of  this  initiative  have 
different meanings in different Faculties; clarification about how fair access to students will be managed; 
clarification  with  regard  to  the  status  of  students  who  are  not  accepted  into  the  program;  concerns  that 
certain students will not be able to afford the residential experience; concerns that some students may not 
want to live in residence; and commentary there are not enough important details surrounding the project 
for it to progress in a meaningful way at this time. 
 
Dr Samarasekera thanked members for their feedback and questions and stated she and her colleagues 
would bring the proposal back once more details were available and following more extensive community 
engagement.

they should not be considered horizontal and that they are dependent on benchmarking and performance.  
She stated that she expects these new figures to be represented by an approximate 7% cut to Faculties 
and 10% to 12% cut to central administrative units. 
 
Members  expressed  a  number  of  questions  and  comments  in  relation  to  this  update,  including,  but  not 
limited to:  clarification about the previous announcement that there would not be any more horizontal cuts; 
clarification about the quantity and distribution of student scholarships; clarification about the impact of the 
Association of Academic Staff - University of Alberta (AASUA) grievance concerning the VSP; and whether 
there  is  a  plan  to  communicate  the  negative  effects  of  the  budget  on  institutional  employment  and 
academic programs to the Alberta public. 
 
Dr  Samarasekera  thanked  members  for  their  comments.    She  also  cautioned  student  leaders  to  obtain

and reputation of the institution.
