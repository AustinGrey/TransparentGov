3.  Comments from the President  
President  and  Chair  Dr  Samarasekera  welcomed  members  to  the  392nd  meeting  of  General  Faculties 
Council (GFC) and commented on the following: 
 

 General Faculties Council 11/25/2013

-  The successful and inspiring Fall 2013 University of Alberta Convocation. 
-  Accolades to members of the University of Alberta community for various prestigious professional and 

-  The  final  Renaissance  Committee  (REN)  Report.    Dr  Samarasekera  thanked  members  of  this 

personal achievements. 

committee for their hard work and effort. 

 
3.1  Leadership Initiative  
Dr Samarasekera expressed her thanks towards Council for their continued interest in this issue and noted 
that, while it is still in the early stages of development, the Acting Provost and Vice-President (Academic) 
has struck a committee to review the initial stages of the Leadership Initiative, with this body composed of 
broad representation from Administration, the Deans, faculty members, and students.  She reported that 
this committee would preliminarily establish the framework for this project.   
 
She  thanked  students  for  their  comprehensive  feedback  on  the  Leadership  Initiative  and  acknowledged 
their position paper on the matter.   
 
She cautioned members to separate the proposed student residence from the idea of a leadership college 
and  noted  that  the  college  will  be  broad  and  inclusive  and  will  provide  students  with  transformative 
leadership opportunities.  She noted that there are still big decisions to be made surrounding the size of the 
college  and  how  it  will  be  both funded  and  managed.    She  stated  that  she  will  continue  to  consult  with 
students  (and,  as  necessary,  Council)  on  these  important  issues.    The  President  also  commented  that, 
generally, there needs to be more student residence spaces on the campuses of the University of Alberta. 
 
Dr  Samarasekera  concluded  by  stating  that  this  matter  would  again  be  discussed  by  GFC  once  further 
details have been established. 
 
3.2 
Dr Samarasekera reported that she has been in the process of drafting an ‘action plan’ in response to the 
Board of Governors’ reaffirmation of institutional excellence pledged at its April, 2013 strategic retreat.  She 
noted that this action plan is centered around the themes of academic transformation, sustainable financial 
modeling,  efficient  administration,  and  fostering  a  culture  of  change.    She  stated  that  the  plan  will  be 
presented to the Board of Governors at its December 13, 2013 meeting, followed by a presentation to GFC 
on February 3, 2014. 
 
A  member  enquired  about  when  GFC  members  will  get  an  opportunity  to  debate  the concepts of  these 
issues and followed up with a question relating to the approval of colleges.

DISCUSSION ITEMS 
 
5.  Dare to Discover (D2D) Report Card  
Materials before members are contained in the official meeting file. 
 
Presenter: Indira Samarasekera, President and Chair, GFC 
 
Purpose of the Proposal: The primary audience for the D2D Report Card is the Board of Governors, but it 
is a public document that is distributed widely. This discussion is an opportunity for GFC to learn about 
some of the diverse University initiatives and the qualitative and quantitative indicators used to measure 
our progress against Board metrics. 
 
Discussion: 
Dr Samarasekera noted that, although this is the first time the D2D Report Card has been presented at 
GFC,  it  represents  a  broad  overview,  based  on  several  measurements,  of  the  state  of  the  University  of 
Alberta compared to other similar public research universities.  She noted that the Report Card aligns with 
the four cornerstones of Dare to Discover, namely:  talented people; learning, discovery and citizenship; 
connecting communities; transformative organization and support. 
 
She  reported  that,  across  the  spectrum,  the  University  of  Alberta  has  made  gains  in  certain  areas  and 
remained  stagnant  or  has  gone  backward  in  others  but  that  the  institution  has  maintained  its  standing 
overall.  She added that the recent financial crisis faced by the University has added to this situation.  Dr 
Samarasekera concluded by indicating that the final D2D Report Card will be presented next year to both 
the Board of Governors and to GFC. 
 
During the ensuing discussion, members expressed a number of comments and questions, including, but 
not limited to:  whether the figures surrounding graduate student support include scholarships; an update 
on the status of graduate student scholarships provided by and at the University of Alberta; and clarification 
about Figure 11 (ie, Provincial/State and Tuition and Fees Operating Revenue per FTE Student, University 
of Alberta and Selected Peers) within the Report Card. 
 
6.  University of Alberta Budget – Update  
There were no documents.

Presenter(s): Indira Samarasekera, President and Chair, GFC; Martin Ferguson-Pell, Acting Provost and 
Vice-President  (Academic)  and  Acting  Chair,  GFC  Executive  Committee;  Phyllis  Clark,  Vice-President 
(Finance and Administration) 
 
Purpose of the Proposal: To provide GFC members with an update about the University of Alberta budget. 
 
Discussion: 
Dr  Samarasekera  reported  that  for  the  first  time  in  the  University  of  Alberta’s  history,  the  Provincial 
Government  has  provided  in-year  funding  of  $14.4  million  to  the  institution,  aimed  towards  enrollment 
pressures and quality student experiences.  She thanked Mr Douglas Goss, Chair, Board of Governors, for 
his tireless efforts advocating for continued investment in the University of Alberta.  She added that, while 
there is latitude to use the funding where needed, the Senior Administration as well as the Deans will be 
meeting to discuss its strategic application towards enrollment pressures and other relevant initiatives. 
 
Dr Samarasekera continued by stating that the Government has indicated their desire for the University of 
Alberta  to  accommodate  more  graduate  students,  but  she  noted  that  the  University  must  receive  the 
appropriate financial support for more professors, support staff, laboratories, and library services to make 
this a reality.  She explained that the amount of Government investment for next year’s budget remains 
unknown, which is an additional complicating factor in budget planning for the University. 
 
A member enquired about the usage of the in-year funding in relation to graduate teaching.

Discussion: 
During the ensuing discussion within Question Period in relation to previously-submitted written questions, 
members expressed a number of comments and questions, including, but not limited to: whether there can 
be  more  time  afforded  to  discuss  proposed  increases  to  tuition  fees  so  that  students  can  adequately 
prepare for the discussion; whether additional consultation regarding proposed increases to tuition fees can 
be provided; clarification about how costs related to fee-supported services relate to the costs associated 
with educating international students; that students would be more understanding if there was, in their view, 
clear justification for the proposed increases in tuition and fees; whether the University of Alberta plans to 
increase  international  tuition  and  fees  by  more  than  the  Consumer  Price  Index  (CPI)  in  the  future; 
clarification  surrounding  a  break-down  of  the  5%  increase  to  international  student  tuition  and  its 
deployment; clarification about the consultation process surrounding the proposal concerning increases to 
international student tuition; that the tuition increases negatively impact the lives of international students; 
that it may be difficult to retain international graduate students if costs increase; clarification about the use 
of the additional revenue generated by increasing international student tuition and fees; that in order to be 

 General Faculties Council 11/25/2013 
Page 8 

 
eligible  for  bursaries,  students  must  already  be  experiencing  financial  hardship;  clarification  about  the 
University of Alberta’s relationship with Udacity; that it takes time for new revenue generation in Faculties 
to be impactful; that the endeavors of a publicly-funded institution should not singularly include initiatives 
around frank revenue generation; that Administration could do more to express gratitude towards Albertans 
for  their  significant  financial  contributions  toward  the  University  of  Alberta;  that  there  needs  to  be  more 
advocacy  done  publicly  surrounding  the  fact  the  University  of  Alberta  was  established  in  1908  by  the 
Province of Alberta as an independent academic-research institution; clarification surrounding the impact of 
recent budget cuts on the Canadian Circumpolar Institute (CCI); clarification surrounding the true costs of 
educating a student; that, in a member’s opinion, the provision of incorrect figures surrounding the costs 
associated  with  educating  students  taints  ensuing  discussions;  whether  there  could  be  an  increase  of 
services and bursaries for international students in light of the proposed tuition increases; and clarification 
surrounding the definition of what is meant by a “transitory document.” 
 
Given  that  Question  Period  had  reached  its  30-minute  limit,  Mr  Kusmu  proposed  a  Motion  to  extend 
Question Period. 
 
Motion:  Kusmu/Epperson 
 

THAT General Faculties Council extend the length of Question Period at its November 25, 2013 meeting.                                
                                                                                                                                                        CARRIED 

 
During the discussion within the extended Question Period, members expressed a number of comments 
and questions including, but not limited to:  whether international tuition and fees could be grandfathered 
for  affected  students  currently  at  the  University  of  Alberta;  that  various  publications  distributed  to 
international  students  provide  advanced  warning  that  the  University  of  Alberta  has  a  right  to  and  may 
choose to increase tuition and fees and that the students should anticipate this may occur during their time 
at  the  institution;  that  the  proposed  5%  increase  in  international  student  tuition  is  reasonable;  that  the 
University Calendar has not been updated to reflect the new proposed tuition rates; that Administration did 
not properly consult with all relevant parties before proposing the tuition increases; that graduate fees at 
the University of Alberta only seem low in comparison to institutions in Ontario and that, regionally, they are 
not that low; and that the focus of the academy should not be on targeting a vulnerable group of students 
for revenue generation but, instead, the focus should be on strongly advocating for more public funding, 
overall.
