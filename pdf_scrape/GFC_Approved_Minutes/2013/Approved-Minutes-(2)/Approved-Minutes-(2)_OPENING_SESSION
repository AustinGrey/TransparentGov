3.  Comments from the President 
 
President  and  Chair,  Dr  Indira  Samarasekera,  welcomed  all  to  the  389th  meeting  of  General  Faculties 
Council (GFC) and reported:   
 

  On  the  retirement  of  several  longstanding  GFC  members,  notably  Mr  Gerry  Kendal,  University 
Registrar,  and  Mr  Ernie  Ingles,  Vice-Provost  and  Director,  School  of  Library  and  Information 
Studies.  She thanked all departing members of GFC for their dedication and hard work. 
 

  On  the  Provincial  Government’s  vision  of  Campus  Alberta,  the re-opening  of  the  Post-Secondary 
Learning Act (PSLA), and a recent meeting with Mr Thomas Lukaszuk, Deputy Premier and Minister 
of  Enterprise  and  Advanced  Education  (EAE).    She  stated  that  she  will  be  attempting  to  gather 
concrete  objectives  from  the  Provincial  Government  surrounding  their  plans  for  Campus  Alberta.  
She noted that the PSLA serves the University of Alberta well, and it may not be beneficial to re-
open  it.    At  the  request  of  Dr  Samarasekera,  Acting  Provost  Dr  Ferguson-Pell  was  invited  to 
comment on a recent meeting he had with Minister Lukaszuk.  He reported that during this meeting, 
the  Minister  discussed  results-based  budgeting,  plans  for  a  possible  institute  that  would  foster 
commercialization opportunities across Campus Alberta, potential changes to Alberta Innovates, re-

 

opening the PSLA, and performance criteria for Campus Alberta.  He noted that the discussion did 
not yield many specific details on these matters.

  On  the  Memorandum  of  Understanding  (MOU).  She  reported  that  following  a  request  from  the 
Alberta  Council  of  Presidents, citing  the  need for  the  document  to  be  vetted through governance 
processes,  the  Ministry  of  EAE  has  agreed  to  move  the  deadline  for  completion  of  the  MOU  to 
October  31,  2013.    She  noted  that  the  University  of  Alberta  will  collaborate  with  fellow 
Comprehensive  Academic  and  Research  Intensive  (CARI)  institutions  of  Alberta  in  completing 
certain  sections  of  the  MOU  and  provided  members  with  a  governance  timeline  of  a  draft  MOU 
presentation  at  the  June  21,  2013  Board  of  Governors  meeting,  a  first  draft  in  July,  and  then 
discussion of the draft MOU at the September 16, 2013 GFC meeting, with an aim to submit a final 
document  by  the  stated  deadline  of  October  31,  2013.    She  emphasized  that the  MOU  will  be  a 
condensed document.  She reminded members to monitor the posts on the University’s Colloquy 
blog for updates. 
 

  On the Worldwide Universities Network (WUN).  She explained to Council that WUN is a group of 
19 research-intensive universities which collaborate on global research topics.  She reported that at 
the  recent  WUN  meeting,  members  discussed  ideas  surrounding  the  Network’s  areas  of  focus:  
climate change, understanding cultures, higher education, and public health.  She noted that food 
security  was  determined  to  be  the  next  area  of  focus  and  that  proposals  would  be  prepared  for 
consideration by several international funding agencies.

5.  Merger of the Augustana Faculty’s Department of Fine Arts and Department of Humanities 
 
Materials before members are contained in the official meeting file. 
 
Presenter:  Allen Berger, Dean, Augustana Faculty 
 
Purpose of the Proposal:  To create administrative efficiencies and reduced expenditures and help facilitate 
improved faculty communication and new collaborations in teaching and research. 
 
Discussion: 
 
Dean Berger explained to members that in an attempt to review administrative savings within Augustana 
Faculty,  the  proposal  speaks  to  the  merger  of  two  small  departments,  resulting  in  three  equally-sized 
departments within the Faculty.  He reported that the proposal was approved by Augustana Faculty Council 
unanimously—this serves as a reflection of support from the departments.  He drew members’ attention to 
the corresponding letters of support for the proposal and noted that programs and courses would not be 
negatively impacted. 
 
Motion: Amaral/Molzahn 
 
THAT  General  Faculties  Council  recommend  to  the  Board  of  Governors  the  proposed  merger  of 
Augustana Faculty’s Department of Fine Arts and Department of Humanities into a single Department of 
Fine Arts and Humanities, as submitted by the Dean of Augustana Faculty and as set forth in Attachment 
1, to take effect July 1, 2013.                                                                                                 
                                                                                                                                                          CARRIED
