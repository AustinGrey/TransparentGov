3.  Comments from the President 
 
President  and  Chair,  Dr  Indira  Samarasekera,  welcomed  all  to  the  389th  meeting  of  General  Faculties 
Council (GFC) and reported:   
 

  On  the  retirement  of  several  longstanding  GFC  members,  notably  Mr  Gerry  Kendal,  University 
Registrar,  and  Mr  Ernie  Ingles,  Vice-Provost  and  Director,  School  of  Library  and  Information 
Studies.  She thanked all departing members of GFC for their dedication and hard work. 
 

  On  the  Provincial  Government’s  vision  of  Campus  Alberta,  the re-opening  of  the  Post-Secondary 
Learning Act (PSLA), and a recent meeting with Mr Thomas Lukaszuk, Deputy Premier and Minister 
of  Enterprise  and  Advanced  Education  (EAE).    She  stated  that  she  will  be  attempting  to  gather 
concrete  objectives  from  the  Provincial  Government  surrounding  their  plans  for  Campus  Alberta.  
She noted that the PSLA serves the University of Alberta well, and it may not be beneficial to re-
open  it.    At  the  request  of  Dr  Samarasekera,  Acting  Provost  Dr  Ferguson-Pell  was  invited  to 
comment on a recent meeting he had with Minister Lukaszuk.  He reported that during this meeting, 
the  Minister  discussed  results-based  budgeting,  plans  for  a  possible  institute  that  would  foster 
commercialization opportunities across Campus Alberta, potential changes to Alberta Innovates, re-

 

opening the PSLA, and performance criteria for Campus Alberta.  He noted that the discussion did 
not yield many specific details on these matters.

  On  the  Memorandum  of  Understanding  (MOU).  She  reported  that  following  a  request  from  the 
Alberta  Council  of  Presidents, citing  the  need for  the  document  to  be  vetted through governance 
processes,  the  Ministry  of  EAE  has  agreed  to  move  the  deadline  for  completion  of  the  MOU  to 
October  31,  2013.    She  noted  that  the  University  of  Alberta  will  collaborate  with  fellow 
Comprehensive  Academic  and  Research  Intensive  (CARI)  institutions  of  Alberta  in  completing 
certain  sections  of  the  MOU  and  provided  members  with  a  governance  timeline  of  a  draft  MOU 
presentation  at  the  June  21,  2013  Board  of  Governors  meeting,  a  first  draft  in  July,  and  then 
discussion of the draft MOU at the September 16, 2013 GFC meeting, with an aim to submit a final 
document  by  the  stated  deadline  of  October  31,  2013.    She  emphasized  that the  MOU  will  be  a 
condensed document.  She reminded members to monitor the posts on the University’s Colloquy 
blog for updates. 
 

  On the Worldwide Universities Network (WUN).  She explained to Council that WUN is a group of 
19 research-intensive universities which collaborate on global research topics.  She reported that at 
the  recent  WUN  meeting,  members  discussed  ideas  surrounding  the  Network’s  areas  of  focus:  
climate change, understanding cultures, higher education, and public health.  She noted that food 
security  was  determined  to  be  the  next  area  of  focus  and  that  proposals  would  be  prepared  for 
consideration by several international funding agencies.

5.  Merger of the Augustana Faculty’s Department of Fine Arts and Department of Humanities 
 
Materials before members are contained in the official meeting file. 
 
Presenter:  Allen Berger, Dean, Augustana Faculty 
 
Purpose of the Proposal:  To create administrative efficiencies and reduced expenditures and help facilitate 
improved faculty communication and new collaborations in teaching and research. 
 
Discussion: 
 
Dean Berger explained to members that in an attempt to review administrative savings within Augustana 
Faculty,  the  proposal  speaks  to  the  merger  of  two  small  departments,  resulting  in  three  equally-sized 
departments within the Faculty.  He reported that the proposal was approved by Augustana Faculty Council 
unanimously—this serves as a reflection of support from the departments.  He drew members’ attention to 
the corresponding letters of support for the proposal and noted that programs and courses would not be 
negatively impacted. 
 
Motion: Amaral/Molzahn 
 
THAT  General  Faculties  Council  recommend  to  the  Board  of  Governors  the  proposed  merger  of 
Augustana Faculty’s Department of Fine Arts and Department of Humanities into a single Department of 
Fine Arts and Humanities, as submitted by the Dean of Augustana Faculty and as set forth in Attachment 
1, to take effect July 1, 2013.                                                                                                 
                                                                                                                                                          CARRIED

DISCUSSION ITEMS 
 
6. 
 
Materials before members are contained in the official meeting file. 
 
Presenter: Indira Samarasekera, President and Chair, GFC 
 
Purpose of the Discussion: For information. 
 
Discussion: 
President Samarasekera explained to members that she will be creating an arm’s length GFC Task Force 
to review GFC and its Standing Committees, noting that the review will examine Terms of Reference for 
GFC  and  each  GFC  Standing  Committee,  compare  them  with  the  Terms  of  Reference  and  activities  of 
other  GFC  Standing  Committees,  and  ensure  that  there  is  a  clear  delineation  between  governance  and 
administration.  She stated that now is the time to ensure that processes at the University of Alberta are 
streamlined,  effective,  and  strategic,  and  she  added  that  GFC  should  be  a  forum  in  which  substantive 
discussions and debates occur.  She added that she hopes to decrease the level of repetition within the 
governance process, ensuring that members’ time is utilized efficiently in an environment when there is a 
need to do more with fewer resources. 
 
She  reported  that  the  GFC  Task  Force  will  be  populated  by  two  faculty  members  with  expertise  in 
governance as well as one graduate student representative who, similarly, has some expertise in this area.  
She stated that a report from the GFC Task Force will be presented to the GFC Executive Committee and 
to GFC in the Fall.  
 
During the ensuing discussion, members expressed several comments and questions, including, but not 
limited  to:    that  it  is  beneficial  to  routinely  review  governance  processes  for  efficiency;  clarification  on 
whether the University of Alberta has faculty members with an expertise in university governance; how the 
review aligns with “Dare to Deliver”; clarification of the scope of the review; that GFC is seen by some to be 
a “rubber stamp”; that the GFC Executive Committee retains a lot of power and is seen to be operating 
beyond  GFC;  concern  that  some  GFC  Standing  Committees  report  to  the  Board  of  Governors  and, 
seemingly, not GFC; that all GFC Standing Committees should report directly to GFC; that the material on 
this  item,  provided  to  members,  did  not  contain  information  on  the  inclusion  of  the  graduate  student 
representative on the GFC Task Force; a suggestion to include an undergraduate student representative 
on  the  GFC  Task  Force;  concern  that  the  summer  months  would  not  be  enough  time  to  complete  the 
review; and clarification about the cross-over between administrative issues and governance. 
 
At  the  conclusion  of  the  discussion,  Dr  Samarasekera  noted  she  was  amenable  to  this  Task  Force 
including an undergraduate student representative.

The Umbrella Committee (TUC) Report 

General Faculties Council / 6/3/2013 
Page 8 

Budget Principles (and Update) 

 
 Dr  Ferguson-Pell  explained  that  ‘The  Umbrella  Committee  (TUC)  Report’  represents  the  final  report  for 
TUC, adding that the Strategic Initiatives Group (SIG), under the direction of its Chair, Dr Erasmus Okine 
(who was in attendance at this meeting of GFC), will address any remaining topics not considered by TUC 
during  the  time  in  existence.  He  noted  that  all  other  matters  are  being  considered  by  the  Renaissance 
Committee (REN). 
 
Members expressed several comments and questions in relation to this item, including, but not limited to:  
clarification with regard to the role of REN; and clarification about Central Administration’s plan to address 
the issue of indirect costs of research.

Materials before members are contained in the official meeting file. 
 
Presenters:    Martin  Ferguson-Pell,  Acting  Provost  and  Vice-President  (Academic);  Phyllis  Clark,  Vice 
President (Finance and Administration) 
 
Purpose  of  the  Proposal:    Section  3(4)(a)  of  the  GFC  Academic  Planning  Committee  (APC)  Terms  of 
Reference on budget matters states that GFC APC is to “recommend to GFC on budget principles.” The 
budget principles as recommended by GFC APC at its meeting of May 22, 2013 are attached for GFC’s 
consideration. 
 
Discussion: 
Dr Ferguson-Pell explained to members that in an effort to provide clear guidelines for the University of 
Alberta to direct future academy-wide changes, a set of budget principles had been drafted. 
 
Members expressed a number of comments and questions in relation to the budget principles, including, 
but not limited to:  a suggestion to include the words “publicly funded” within principle 1; clarification about 
the meaning of “demonstrable excellence”; a suggestion to amend punctuation within the document; that 
Central Administration may not be able to minimize job losses because certain losses will be directed and 
decided by individual Faculties; clarification about increasing international student enrolments but not the 
number of Canadian students; that Central Administration may have minimal control over increasing the 
number and quality of graduate students; clarification about how the costs of new initiatives will be weighed 
against the need to maintain existing programs and staff in the current financial climate; clarification about 
communicating with frequency and openness in relation to releasing each Faculty’s budget letter publicly; 
whether  Central  Administration  could  release  the  budget  letters  to  University  of  Alberta  leaders  “in 
confidence”; a suggestion to include an “unintended consequences” clause into the principles; a suggestion 
to include a principle that might address increasing workload and changing working conditions for existing 
staff;  that  there  could  be  issues  surrounding  equity,  as  a  large  percentage  of  full  professors  are  male; 
clarification  about  the  details  of  determining  Faculty-specific  differential  cuts;  that  the  principles  do  not 
include information about process; clarification about what is being done to prepare for cuts in 2014-2015 
and 2015-16; clarification about the future impact on tuition rates; and clarification about resource planning 
to ensure that international students maintain their health and wellness while at the University of Alberta. 
 
Members discussed suggested revisions and the Mover and Seconder to the Motion before Council agreed 
to several ‘friendly amendments’ to the budget principles. 
 
Motion: Belosevic/Ingles

budget,  as  provided  by  the  President’s  Executive  Committee  and  as  set  forth  in  Attachment  1,  as 
amended, to take effect upon final approval.
