Discussion: Mr Rahman explained the White Paper was an environmental scan th at surveyed the current state of contract teaching faculty at the University of Alberta. There was discussion about the potential impact of the forthcoming changes to the Contract Academic Staff: Teaching (CAS:T) agreement on the findings of the White Paper. In addition, members suggested revisions to the White Paper in order to address inaccuracies within it as well as the forthcoming changes to the Contract Academic Staff: Teaching (CAS:T) agreement. Members discussed the difference between approving an item and accepting it, and a member suggested completing revisions to the White Paper before it advances within the governance structure. The Chair offered direction for next stages and suggested that the White Paper be forwarded to the GFC Academic Planning Committee for discussion. A friendly amendment was proposed to change the title within the motion to match the one offered in the White Paper and the Chair asked that the Outline of Issue for the item be changed to reflect that it would be discussed, for feedback, at the GFC Academic Planning Committee.",

            "Description": "Discussion: Dr Nocente and her team gave an overview of how the GFC motion was addressed. This involved: 1) A literature review on student rating systems previously presented in a 2009 University of Alberta report was updated (Evaluation of Teaching at the University of Alberta: Report of the Sub-Committee of the Committee on the Learning Environment). To answer the question: What does the research have to say about student rating systems? The literature review was presented in the fall. 2) A study on the use of USRIs and other methods of teaching evalution at the University of Alberta. The qualitative project involved interviews with Department Chairs (or their equivalents in non-departmental Faculties) to answer the questions: • How are the tools used to evaluated teaching at the U of A? • What are the types of multi-faceted teaching evaluation? The study showed: 1) Participants from almost all Faculties use USRI scores and comments 2) Two statements were commonly used to evaluate teaching: “Overall the instructor was excellent” and “Overall the quality of the course content was excellent.” 3) Most chairs try to contextualize their interpretations of USRI results 4) For multifaceted evaluation, in-class peer observations were the most commonly used additional source of information, followed by individual instructor self reflections. Most participants obtain these results on a voluntary basis, only when professors agree to provide these supplementary materials. Some chairs have implemented yearly faculty audits in which a portion of their faculty’s teaching is evaluated using additional metrics. 5) Even when chairs obtain additional multifaceted evaluations, not all report bringing them to FEC. When the information is used at FEC, it is used to inform their narrative and is only brought up when there is a challenge. 6) Most chairs voiced their need for additional supports to better evaluate teaching. 7) Chairs have identified some issues when evaluating teaching exclusively with USRI, and possible alternatives to supplement these scores, but still they hope the institution provides a solution for their concerns. There was significant discussion about defining effective teaching and how that definition would drive the evaluation of teaching. The committee recognized the shortcomings of the USRI and that some of the questions were rooted in the evolution of the tool at the university. There was agreement that the USRI is one tool of many that can be used and noted that it required revision to be more informative and useful. The committee also noted that a definition of ‘diverse teaching modes’ was required to guide faculty evaluation. Members expressed interest in further information about other teaching evaluation tools and discussed the merits of additional formative evaluation during a course to provide instructors with feedback. Finally, it was noted that students were most satisfied when they understood how they were being assessed and that this is also useful for instructors. The committee discussed how to proceed and struck a subcommittee to develop recommendations that would inform elements of CLE’s workplan for next year; the Chair, Dr Varnhagen, Dr Vaidyanathan, Mr. Jeff Rawlings and Dr Miller-Young agreed to participate.",

Mandate) \nThe mandate of the subcommittee is to explore the opportunities and \nchallenges for creating a teaching tenure stream at University of Alberta \nwith the goal to enhance quality instruction and learning environment for \nundergraduate students. To fulfill this mandate the committee will \nconsider undertaking the following activities: \n1. Consider the ways creation of teaching tenure stream \n(accompanied by continuing appoint and job stability, greater \nprofessional development opportunities, increased \nscholarship of teaching and learning, increased support and \nresources from home department and faculty) will potentially \naffect the learning environment and quality of instruction \navailable to undergraduate students at University of Alberta. \n2. Review teaching tenure stream practices and arrangements \nat other Canadian peer institutions and research available \nliterature on the issue in Canadian post-secondary landscape \n(and if need be, at equivalent American public post-\nsecondary context). \n1.

While there are some similarities between the Canadian system and \nthe American one, it is safe to say that the American system is more stratified and strained than \nthe Canadian one. Therefore, particularly when looking at teaching outcomes, many of the \napparent downsides of hiring teaching-only stream faculty may actually be attributable to \nsystemic chronic-underfunding, rather than shortcomings of the individuals in these positions. \nFor instance, one study mentions that teaching-only faculty are less likely to have office hours on \ncampus, but then recounts a story about an instructor converting a utility closet to an office.1 \nCanadian universities are – generally speaking – facing less severe challenges and the issues that \nappear to plague American contingent instructors would likely be rather foreign to their \nCanadian counterparts.  \nAdditionally, there is lack of available longitudinal data on how student outcomes have changed \nbefore and after the establishment of teaching-stream. This makes conclusively proving that \nteaching-stream improves student outcomes challenging. However, there is a strong inductive \nargument that the introduction of tenure, with its benefits of job security and the potential for \npedagogical research, will have a positive impact on student outcomes. \nArguments against Teaching Stream: \nThere are a number of issues that arise when looking at the workability of implementing a \nteaching stream. Some of which are valuable questions to ask, while other others seem to flow \nfrom a philosophical aversion to teaching-intensive positions. A major challenge is, of course, \nhow to develop and implement a teaching-intensive tenure stream, and whether or not that \nstream should be fully integrated within the traditional tenure system, or rather if it should \nsomehow operate in a separate, yet parallel space. A Council of Ontario Universities (COU) \nreport argues that as long as teaching is valued, rightly or wrongly, less than research, integrating \nthese teaching-intensive roles into the standard tenure system will only perpetuate the bias \nagainst those focused primarily on teaching.2 While this concern appears somewhat valid, as this \nissue frequently comes up in interviews with teaching stream faculty, it is likely that \n1 Adrianna Kezar, “Examining Non-Tenure Track Faculty Perceptions of How Departmental Policies and Practices Shape Their \nPerformance and Ability to Create Student Learning at Four-Year Institutions,” Research in Higher Education 54, no. 5 (2013): \n587. \n2 Leslie Sanders, Teaching Stream Positions: Some Implications (Toronto, 2011). \n  2 \nnormalization of teaching-stream faculty, and the likely persistent salary differentiation should \nserve to partially ameliorate this problem.3  \nThe COU also implies that, somehow, a focus on teaching may erode the “robust culture of \ninquiry in undergraduate education” that should be present on campus.4 Of the many objections \nraised by those who oppose the introduction of teaching stream stream faculty, this one is \nperhaps the most problematic and persistent. Traditional discourses on the role and structure of \nthe university tend to assume a high degree of complementarity between research and teaching, \nand on many levels, this relationship appears natural and rational.5 However, the data on \nundergraduate education quality presents a more complicated picture. The majority of literature \nsuggests that there is no relationship between quality of research and quality of teaching, and \nfurther that both teaching and research intensive faculty are adequately equipped to provide \nstudents with both a broad base of knowledge and specific insights into their field.6The evolution \nand rising importance of research productivity at universities has created an incentive structure \nsuch that for academics employed in ‘traditional’ roles, research tends to take precedence over \nteaching and pedagogical research. The introduction of a teaching stream should help mediate \nthese competing interests, and create ‘space’ within a department for the furthering of teaching \nmethods (including scholarship of teaching) without negatively impacting the research \nproductivity of research-focused professors. Further, a more accurate predictor of student \nlearning outcomes seems to be an individual’s employment of certain teaching strategies – \nstrategies that are not, by any means, accessible only to research-focused academics.7  \nThere is also the issue of the overall research quality and prestige of an institution, as both are at \npotentially at risk if the professoriate becomes dominated by individuals not actively engaged in \ntraditional research. While this concern may be valid, there is no real way of addressing it \nwithout getting into a larger discussion about the root cause of this issue, university funding. If \nan institution is being faced with stagnant or shrinking budgets, while also facing growing \nenrollment, there is no way out of that predicament that does not involve making painful choices. \nFurther, it is unlikely that any major Canadian research institution (particularly U15) is intent on \ndecimating the number of research-focused academics at their school, so the concern about the \nerosion of prestige seems to be more of a straw man than a substantive concern.  \nThe majority of arguments offered against the creation of teaching stream position are offered by \ntwo specific subsets of the academic community. One group is the already privileged set of \nindividuals who have the benefit of tenure and therefore need not be particularly concerned about \n3 Susan Vajoczki et al., “Teaching-Stream Faculty in Ontario Universities The Higher Education Quality Council of Ontario” \n(2011): 36–37. \n4 Sanders, Teaching Stream Positions: Some Implications, 6. \n5 Ruth Neumann, “Perceptions of the Teaching-Research Nexus: A Framework for Analysis,” Higher Education 23, no. 2 (1992): \n159–171. \n6 J. Hattie and H. W. Marsh, “The Relationship Between Research and Teaching: A Meta-Analysis,” Review of Educational \nResearch 66, no. 4 (1996): 529–530. \n7 R. G. Baldwin and M. R. Wawrzynski, “Contingent Faculty as Teachers: What We Know; What We Need to Know,” American \nBehavioral Scientist 55, no. 11 (2011): 1501. \n  3 \ntheir job security, or ability to earn a stable, fair income.8 The other group are those who are \npresently employed in teaching-intensive roles but who would prefer to be employed in a more \n‘traditional’, i.e. research-intensive position.9 For them, they see the codification and \nformalization of teaching stream as detrimental, as these roles, viewed by some young academics \nas transitory, will increasingly become institutionalized and permanent. Both of these objections \nare problematic, as each group seems to presuppose that every individual within the academic \ncommunity has, or ought to have, ambitions to carry out intensive research. Obviously, this is not \nthe case, and there a number of instructors at other universities who have spoken to the fact that \nthey prefer and also enjoy teaching. In some cases, the creation of secure, teaching-intensive \npositions has even drawn professors from other universities, eager to extricate themselves from \nthe “publish-or-die” attitude of more traditional faculty appointments.10 Even for individuals \n‘stuck’ teaching, who would prefer to be employed in a position that involved a greater degree of \nresearch, the introduction of job security and retention incentives is most likely preferable to the \ntumultuous status-quo of being sessional or contract instructors.  \nThere is some literature that suggests that part-time instructors may negatively impact student \nlearning outcomes and retention.11 This concern comes from speculation that part-time faculty \nare less likely than their full-time, tenured colleagues to understand the campus culture, be \nfamiliar with services to support student success and be less willing to engage with students \noutside the classroom. If this is the case, and that in and of itself is questionable, it strengthens \nthe argument for the adoption of teaching-stream tenure positions, or other means of providing \njob security and a sense of belonging to contract faculty, as the provision of these benefits will \nlikely increase their connection to the institution and their investment in better understanding the \ncampus and associated services. A large body of research, which holds that job security and job \nperformance are positively correlated, supports this conclusion.12  A renewed incentive structure \nand reduced uncertainty makes these sort of productivity-enhancing investments worthwhile for \nthe affected instructors. A study of the impact of instructor status on teaching quality at a large \nCanadian university found that “there is not a strong correlation between research-focused and \nteaching-focused college instructors – both have effective and noneffective teachers within each \ngroup…instructors do not make a large difference to student achievement”.13 These findings \n8 For example, see: Sanders, Teaching Stream Positions: Some Implications. \n9 Lee Bessette, “The Teaching Track? Really?,” Inside Higher Ed, 2012, https://www.insidehighered.com/blogs/college-ready-\nwriting/teaching-track-really. \n10 James Bradshaw, “For a New Kind of Professor, Teaching Comes First,” The Globe and Mail, 2013, \nhttp://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/education/new-breed-of-university-faculty-puts-focus-on-teaching-over-\nresearch/article14117866/; Moira Farr, “For Teaching-Only Faculty, a Controversial Role,” University Affairs, 2008, \nhttp://www.universityaffairs.ca/features/feature-article/those-who-can-teach/. \n11 See: Timothy Schibik and Charles Harrington, “Caveat Emptor: Is There a Relationship between Part-Time Faculty Utilization \nand Student Learning Outcomes and Retention,” AIR Professional File no. 91 (2004): 2–10. \n12 a.

February (2009): 92. \n  4 \nsuggest that stated concern about teaching-intensive faculty eroding the quality of education is \nvastly overstated. In fact, there is some evidence that suggests teaching-intensive faculty can \nactually have a positive impact on the quality of education at the undergraduate level.  \nArguments for Teaching Stream: \nThere are a number of strong practical, as well as philosophical arguments for the adoption of \nsome form of teaching stream at the University of Alberta. Much of the recent scholarship on \nteaching quality has consistently found that there is either no difference in educational quality \nbetween tenured and contract instructors or, in some cases, that these non-tenured teachers \nactually improve student success and engagement. A study conducted at Northwestern \nUniversity found a statistically significant increase in both students’ grades and the likelihood of \nthem taking another class in a field if they took a class taught by an instructor rather than a \ntenure-track professor.14 While instructors at Northwestern do not have the benefit of formal \nteaching stream, Northwestern has pursued a policy of nurturing long-term, secure relationships \nwith their instructors. These are individuals “with benefits, career ladders and job security”– \nsomething which could be considered roughly, albeit imperfectly, analogous to tenure.15  \nAnother study that looked nationally at teaching methods in the United States found that full-\ntime faculty, regardless of whether or not they were tenured, were more likely than their part-\ntime counterparts to employ both learning (essays, presentations and peer assessment) and \nsubject (multiple choice exams, short answer exams) centered approaches to teaching, while \npart-time faculty was heavily reliant on only subject-centered evaluations.16 This finding led the \nresearchers to conclude that the most effective allocation of a university’s funds was to focus on \nensuring that contingent instructors were offered full-time positions, as by virtue of being full-\ntime, they were more likely to employ a broad, and constructive, array of evaluative methods.17It \nis worth noting here that there was no difference in the methods of research vs. teaching \nintensive faculty, suggesting that the nature of employment matters more than the individual’s \nfocus.  \nThere is a notable lack of research into the impact of teaching only or contingent faculty on \nlearning outcomes in Canada. The only econometrically sound study of instructor status and \nperceived educational quality was the aforementioned one which found no statistically-\n14 David Figlio, Morton Schapiro, and Kevin Soter, Are Tenure Track Professors Better Teachers?, NBER Working Paper Series \n(Cambridge, MA, 2013), http://www.nber.org/papers/w19406. \n15 Ibid., 9.David Figlio, “Sunday Dialogue: Academia’s Two Tracks,” The New York Times, 2013, \nhttp://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/17/opinion/sunday/sunday-dialogue-academias-two-tracks.html?_r=0. \n16 Baldwin and Wawrzynski, “Contingent Faculty as Teachers: What We Know; What We Need to Know,” 1494. \n17 Ibid., 1505. \n  5 \nsignificant relationship; however the authors did find that teaching-focused instructors received a \nnominally higher score when being assessed on perceived teaching effectiveness.18  \nTeaching Tenure – Policies and Protections  \nAmerican Examples:  \n• The American Association of University Professors (AAUP) has an appendix in a major \nreport on teaching stream initiatives which highlights the approaches that different US \nschools to instituting policies around this new category. Many of the schools listed are \npublically funded, and are therefore reasonable comparators. Most notably, the \nPennsylvania State University system has instituted a formal teacher tenure track, while \nthe University of California system has implemented a system wherein there is no formal \ntenure, but instructors are granted longer-term contracts and more equitable salaries and \nbenefits.  \n• Appendix can be found here: http://www.aaup.org/report/tenure-and-teaching-intensive-\nappointments  \nCanadian Examples:  \n• University of Manitoba: According to a cursory review of the 2010-2013 Collective \nBargaining Agreement it appears as though the university’s teaching-intensive positions \n(Instructor/Lecturer designation) are afforded the same benefits as traditional faculty, \nincluding the ability to accrue research leave and longer-term contracts. Their salaries, \nhowever, are prorated.  \n• University of Toronto – Lecturer and Senior Lecturer, permanent appointments  \n• York: Alternate-Stream Appointment  \n• Waterloo: Continuing Lecturer \n• Dalhousie, McMaster, UBC, SFU and the University of Regina all also have similar \nagreements in place with their instructors and contingent faculty. \nSecuring Institutional and Strategic Commitment  \nWhile the aforementioned schools appear to have created these new positions without excessive \npushback from faculty, there have been some exceptions, where existing faculty associations \nhave strongly pushed back against the creation of teaching stream stream positions – most \nnotably at the University of Ottawa and University of Windsor.19 While there is little information \navailable on the specific issues that faculty at these institutions raised, it is reasonable to assume \nthat they were similar to the general arguments against teaching tenure outlined above. \n18 Hoffmann and Oreopoulos, “Professor Qualities and Student Achievement,” 88. \n19 Farr, “For Teaching-Only Faculty, a Controversial Role.” \nhttp://www.aaup.org/report/tenure-and-teaching-intensive-appointments\nhttp://www.aaup.org/report/tenure-and-teaching-intensive-appointments\nhttps://www.google.ca/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&ved=0CBwQFjAAahUKEwiRkbnfx5rIAhUQRYgKHczcBLc&url=http%3A%2F%2Fumanitoba.ca%2Fadmin%2Fhuman_resources%2Fservices%2Fmedia%2FFinal_version_2010_2013_UMFA_Collective_Agreement.doc&usg=AFQjCNFH7hg6lZoYlenuTYS7U_tj_3SEJg&bvm=bv.103388427,d.cGU&cad=rja\n  6 \nDuring discussions at the Committee on the Learning Environment, it was noted that attention \nshould be paid to the name or title given to members in this potential category. For example, at \nthe University of Toronto individuals recruited in both “teaching stream” and ‘traditional stream’ \nare called professors.. Both are referred to as assistant, associate or full professors depending on \ncareer stage. Alternatively, at UBC, the teaching stream is referred to as “educational leadership \nstream” and progression is made from an instructor position, to a senior instruction, and finally a \nfull professor of teaching with tenure. Members of the Committee on the Learning Environment \nbelieved that the name/title used to refer to individuals in teaching stream may be significant in \nensuring that these members are a valued part of campus, and are regarded similarly, if not \nequally, for their responsibilities and contribution as traditional professors. \nIf the University of Alberta were to move forward on this issue, it would be critical to more \nclosely examine the processes that were used with success at York University, the University of \nToronto and UBC. It would also be helpful to initiate conversations with the Students’ Unions at \nthese institutions to determine how, if at all, they were included in these discussions.  \nThe Delphi Project on Changing Faculty and Student Success, located the University of \nSouthern California, has developed a number of resources designed at facilitating discussions \naround the role and status of teaching-intensive faculty members.20 This includes tracking the \npaths of successful attempts to address and change the role of these instructors on a number of \ncampuses in the United States. There are, however, no similar studies of Canadian institutions \nthat are readily available.  \nWorks Cited  \nBaldwin, R. G., and M. R.

GFC policy 111 Teaching and Learning and Teaching Evaluation \n“111.2 Teaching Evaluation  \n1. Evaluation of teaching at the University of Alberta serves two \npurposes: \na. Summative – Evaluation provides a review and overview of an \ninstructor’s teaching that is an essential element in promotion and tenure \ndecisions. In its summative form, teaching evaluation forms a basis for \nrewarding excellence, as well as the basis for withholding reward. \nb. Formative – Evaluation provides helpful feedback to teachers by \nidentifying teaching strengths and weaknesses and, in so doing, giving \nguidance for the improvement or refinement of teaching skills. \n2. Evaluation of teaching must be multifaceted. Multifaceted evaluation \nshall include the Universal Student Ratings of Instruction set out in \nSection 111.3 and other methods of assessing teaching designed within \nindividual Faculties to respond to the particular conditions of that \nFaculty. Such assessments shall include one or more of the following: \ninput from administrators, peers, self, undergraduate and graduate \nstudents, and alumni. \n3. Recognizing that the evaluation of teaching at the University shall be \nItem No. 5 \nGFC COMMITTEE ON THE LEARNING ENVIRONMENT \nFor the Meeting of April 5, 2017 \n multifaceted, Faculty Evaluation Committee (FEC) decisions concerning \ntenure, promotion or unsatisfactory teaching performance must be \nbased on more than one indicator of the adequacy of teaching. \n4. Assessment of teaching involving input from administrators, peers, \nself, alumni, or undergraduate and graduate students in addition to the \nUniversal Student Ratings of Instruction should occur annually prior to \ntenure. For continuing faculty (ie, Categories A1.1, A1.5 and A1.6), such \nassessment will occur at least triennially.  \n5. The University shall continue to support University Teaching Services \nin its education programming which is focused on the development and \nimprovement of teaching and learning and its efforts to enhance \nresearch in university teaching. \n111.3 Universal Student Ratings of Instruction \nIn recognition of the University's commitment to teaching, the General \nFaculties Council endorses a system of Universal Student Ratings of \nInstruction. This system, however, is only one part of the multi-faceted \napproach described in Section 111.2. \nThe Universal Student Ratings of Instruction are administered \nelectronically via a system known as the eUSRI system.   \nThe Universal Student Ratings of Instruction are designed to provide a \nminimal university-wide base of information on student ratings to the \nparties listed in this Section. With this purpose in mind, the General \nFaculties Council adopts the following policies: \nA. All Faculties will ensure that evaluation of all instructors and courses \nwill take place each time a course is offered. The term ‘instructors’ is \nmeant to include tenured professors, tenure-track professors, sessional \ninstructors, clinical instructors, field supervisors and graduate teaching \nassistants with responsibilities for courses. \n[…] \nD. The anonymity of student responses to the Universal Student Ratings \nof Instruction is of fundamental importance in maintaining student \nconfidentiality and encouraging the free expression of views. Under \nnormal circumstances, the anonymity of students will be protected. \nUniversal Student Ratings of Instruction offer an avenue of feedback, \nincluding feedback critical of instructors. \n[…] \nG. The numerical summaries for the ten Universal Student Ratings of \nInstruction questions will be reported to the instructor, the Chair, Director \nor Dean and students. \n[…] \nI. All results given out to students, Chairs, Directors and Deans will have \nthe following cautionary preface: \nStudent questionnaires form an important part of evaluating teaching \neffectiveness but cannot be taken alone as a complete assessment of \nan instructor or course. Factors other than an instructor’s teaching ability \nmay influence ratings. These factors include class size, class level, \nFaculty, time in class, required versus optional course, grade \nItem No. 5 \nGFC COMMITTEE ON THE LEARNING ENVIRONMENT \nFor the Meeting of April 5, 2017 \n expectations, student GPA, gender, race, ethnicity, age of both students \nand instructors. \n[…] \nJ. Nothing in this section will prevent instructors from seeking other \nmeans of feedback from students during the term.” \nThe full GFC Policy 111 Teaching and Learning and Teaching \nEvaluation is available at: \nhttp://www.gfcpolicymanual.ualberta.ca/111TeachingandLearningandTe\nach.aspx \n5.

Executive Summary \nIn May 2016, General Faculties Council tasked the Committee on Learning Environment to report on the “… \nresearch into the use of student rating mechanisms of instruction in university courses. This will be informed by \na critical review of the University of Alberta’s existing Universal Student Ratings of Instruction (USRIs) and their \nuse for assessment and evaluation of teaching as well as a broad review of possible methods of multifaceted \nassessment and evaluation of teaching.” \nMethods \n Qualitative research. Department chairs (or their equivalents in non-departmental faculties) were \nasked to participate in short 30-45 minute (audio-recorded) semi-structured interviews with \nquestions regarding their experiences evaluating teaching. \n Data was collected from January to March 2017, with a response rate of 59%. \nOur committee sought to address the GFC motion by answering the following three questions: \n1. What does the research have to say about student ratings of teaching? \n A literature review on student rating systems previously presented in a 2009 University of Alberta \nreport was updated (Evaluation of Teaching at the U of A: Report of the Sub-Committee of the \nCommittee on the Learning Environment). \n2. How are the USRIs and other tools used in the evaluation of teaching evaluation at the \nUniversity of Alberta? \n Participants from all faculties other than FOMD use USRI scores and comments (and only a portion \nof participants from FOMD) to evaluate teaching. \n Statement 221 (overall the instructor was excellent), and statement 25 (overall the quality of the \ncourse content was excellent) are the most commonly used USRI items to evaluate teaching. \n Most participants try to conceptualize their interpretation of USRI results. \n3. What are some approaches for multi-faceted evaluation of teaching? \n In-class peer teaching observations were the most commonly used additional source of \ninformation, followed by annual instructor pedagogical self-reflections. \n Most participants obtain these resources on a voluntary basis, only when professors agree to give \nthem these supplementary resources. \n Some participants have implemented yearly faculty audits, in which a manageable portion of their \nprofessorate’s teaching is evaluated using additional information. \n Even when participants obtain these resources, not all reported to bring them to FEC. When this \ninformation makes it to FEC, it is used to inform their narrative, and is only explicitly brought up \nwhen there is a concern with the numerical scores. \n Despite more value being placed in teaching, most participants still described a strong bias \ntowards research at their respective FECs. \n 7 \n Most participants voiced their need for additional supports to better evaluate teaching. \n Most participants identified some issues when evaluating teaching exclusively with USRI, and \nsome recommended possible alternatives to supplement these scores, but they still hope the \ninstitution will provide solutions for their concerns. \n 8 \n2. Introduction \nThe University of Alberta’s Institutional Strategic Plan, For the Public Good, underscores its strong commitment \nto teaching and learning. The University community values the intellectual and engaging learning environment \nthat is cultivated by our inspiring teachers.  Accordingly, the evaluation of teaching is essential in upholding \nthese values. \nTeaching evaluations not only affect the careers of individuals at the University of Alberta, they also shape the \nquality of instruction being offered to students. Universal Student Ratings of Instruction (USRI) are often used \nto evaluate teaching quality for faculty annual review and tenure and promotion (summative evaluation). Also, \nUSRIs can provide insight (formative evaluation) into specific areas of strength or improvement related to \ndifferent aspects of teaching such as planning and organization, communication, assessment, etc. However, the \ndual purpose of USRIs is often contentious, particularly because of the perceived weight they carry with Faculty \nEvaluation Committees. \nConsequently, in May 2016, General Faculties Council (GFC) tasked the Committee on Learning Environment \n(CLE) to report on the “… research into the use of student rating mechanisms of instruction in university \ncourses. This will be informed by a critical review of the University of Alberta’s existing Universal Student \nRatings of Instruction (USRIs) and their use for assessment and evaluation of teaching as well as a broad review \nof possible methods of multifaceted assessment and evaluation of teaching. The ultimate objective will be to \nsatisfy the Institutional Strategic Plan: For the Public Good strategy to: Provide robust supports, tools, and \ntraining to develop and assess teaching quality, using qualitative and quantitative criteria that are fair, \nequitable, and meaningful across disciplines.” \nOur committee sought to address the GFC motion by answering the following three questions: \n4. What does the research have to say about student ratings of teaching? \n5. How are the USRIs and other tools used in the evaluation of teaching evaluation at the University of \nAlberta? \n6. What are some approaches for multi-faceted evaluation of teaching? \nFor the first question, we updated a literature review on student rating systems previously presented in a 2009 \nUniversity of Alberta report (Evaluation of Teaching at the U of A: Report of the Sub-Committee of the Committee \non the Learning Environment). To partially address the third question, we resurrected previous work completed \nat the University of Alberta on the multi-faceted evaluation of teaching. This information was presented to CLE \nin September 2016. This report primarily addresses the second and third question through information \ncollected in interviews with department chairs across campus. \nWhile University policy suggests that departments utilize a multi-faceted approach to evaluating teaching, we \ndo not have a clear picture of the tools used other than the mandated Universal Student Rating System (USRI). \nThese interviews helped to uncover how department chairs utilize USRIs to make personnel decisions and the \nhelped to determine which other tools they used to evaluate the quality of teaching in their respective \ndepartments.  \nThe purpose of this study is to describe the current state of teaching evaluation at the University of Alberta. \nMore specifically it will help us understand the tools used to evaluate teaching at the University of Alberta. \nhttp://www.governance.ualberta.ca/GeneralFacultiesCouncil/CommitteeontheLearningEnvironm/~/media/Governance/Documents/GO05/LEA/16-17/USRI-Reference-Material/Executive_Summary-Teaching_Evaluation_at_the_UofA_-_September_2016.pdf\nhttp://www.governance.ualberta.ca/GeneralFacultiesCouncil/CommitteeontheLearningEnvironm/~/media/Governance/Documents/GO05/LEA/16-17/USRI-Reference-Material/Executive_Summary-Teaching_Evaluation_at_the_UofA_-_September_2016.pdf\n 9 \n3. Methods \nEthics approval for this qualitative study was sought from the Human Research Ethics Board at the University of \nAlberta, and obtained December 7, 2016 (Pro00069070).  A qualitative approach with interviews was used to \nelicit the depth of response necessary for understanding the nuances and variety in possible answers.   \nDepartment chairs (or their equivalents in non-departmental faculties) were emailed directly with information \nabout the study, and with copy of the research letter of invitation, and were encouraged to contact any \nmember of the research team if they had questions or concerns. They were asked to participate in a short 30-\n45 minute (audio-recorded) semi-structured interview (see Appendix 1). The interview protocol was pre-\napproved by CLE, and it consisted of questions regarding the chairs’ experiences evaluating teaching. \nParticipants were also given two sample USRI case studies based on real teaching scores (see Appendix 2) and \nasked to interpret the scores. They were directed to reflect on both scores as if both instructors were teaching \ndifferent sections of the same course within their department.  \nData was collected from January to March 2017. \n3.1. Participants \nParticipants were 43 department chairs (or their equivalents in non-departmental faculties) which is a 59% \nresponse rate. The distribution was 9.3% from Agricultural, Life and Environmental Sciences (ALES), 4.7% from \nAlberta School of Business (BUS), 20.9% from Arts (ART), 4.7% from Augustana Campus (AUG), 7% from \nEducation (EDU), 7% from Engineering (ENG), 23.3% from Medicine and Dentistry (FOMD), 4.7% from \nRehabilitation Medicine (RM), 7% from Science (SCI), and 11.6% from all non-departmental faculties (ND) (see \nFigure 1). Response rate reached a minimum of 50% within the different faculties (see Figure 2). \nParticipants reported having an average of 32.07 (SD = 22.42) faculty and FSO, 23.18 (SD = 27.03) sessional or \ncontract instructors, and 3.06 (SD = 3.82) graduate students teaching in their departments. They mentioned \nworking for an average of 4.34 (SD = 3.61) years as department chairs (or their equivalents in non-\ndepartmental faculties), and 9.3% of the total indicated having an interim appointment. \n9.3% \n4\n.7\n%\n20.9% \n4\n.7\n%\n7.0% 7.0% 23.3% \n4\n.7\n%\n7.0% 11.6% \nFigure 1.

Data Analysis \nConfidentiality and anonymity were guaranteed by assigning different pseudonyms to each audio file before it \nwas sent for transcription. Interview transcripts were further anonymized by removing any information that \npotentially singled out the department (i.e., mention of disciplines, courses, specific individuals, and others). \nParticipants from departmental faculties were grouped with the rest of their colleagues, and those from non-\ndepartmental faculties were all grouped together to protect their identity.

Results \nThis section offers both a quantitative and a qualitative summary of all participant responses, except section \n4.1., section 4.2., and section 4.7., in which results only consider participants who reported using USRI. \nInformation in these sections excludes participants from MED who indicated not using USRI, or whose \napplication was not clear (see Figure 3). \n4.1. Use of USRI to Evaluate Teaching \nParticipants from all faculties other than FOMD reported using USRI scores and comments as part of their \nteaching evaluation process (100%). Department chairs from FOMD either mentioned using the USRI scores \n(40%), not using them (20%), or did not provide a definite answer (40%) (see Figure 3).  \nAdditionally, department chairs from FOMD either indicated using USRI comments (30%), not taking them into \nconsideration (30%), or their responses were unclear (40%) (see Figure 4). “I have never seen it, but our largest \nundergraduate program has a different evaluation system, which is mainly based on narrative comments. So, \nyour email, as I said, was the first time that I heard the term ever” (43_MH_010). They were often unsure if their \ndepartment used USRI, or had never heard about USRI, or had never seen the scores (see Appendix 2). \nFROM THIS POINT ON INFORMATION ONLY CONSIDERS PARTICIPANTS WHO \nREPORTED USING USRI \n40.0% 20% 40% \nFigure 3.

Participants from FOMD that Reported Using USRI Comments to Evaluate Teaching \nYes No Unclear \n 13 \nWhen asked which USRI statements were most commonly used in their teaching evaluation process, statement \n221 (overall this instructor was excellent) was identified by 97.3% of participants, statement 25 (overall the \nquality of the course content was excellent) was selected by 67.6%, and statement 9 (the instructor treated \nstudents with respect) was identified by 35.1% (see Figure 5). In general, participants revealed that one or two \nitems are used as an indicator of effective teaching. They seem to have benchmarks in mind as they review \nUSRI scores: \nWe consider all of them, but of course we key in right away on ‘the instructor was excellent.’ You always \nlook at that one first. And overall the course content was excellent is the second thing you look at. And then, \nif there’s problems in either of those two scores you look in more detail at the other questions. There’s \nsomething like 300 faculty members in the Faculty of Science for FEC, so we’re only finding ways to \nefficiently go through these things (01_SC_001). \nParticipants also reflected on the USRI case studies (see Appendix 2). Instructor A had 6 USRI items on the 25th \npercentile or below, and 1 item below the Tukey fence. This instructor scored 4.0 on statement 221, 3.8 on \nstatement 25, and 4.0 on statement 9. Instructor B had 7 USRI items between the 50th and 25th percentile, but \nno items were below the Tukey fence. This instructor scored 4.5 on statement 221, 4.2 on statement 25, and 4.8 \non statement 9. After reflecting on these sample case studies, 8.1% of participants gave Instructor A \n‘unsatisfactory’ reviews, 13.5% thought the scores were ‘okay’, and 24.3% considered the scores were ‘good’ \n(see Figure 6).

Moreover, believing the USRI \ndata indicated their teaching was ‘okay’, 45.9% of participants mentioned that contextual factors should be \nconsidered in the evaluation of teaching (see Figure 6 and 7), and that to provide an informed interpretation of \nthese USRI scores, they required more information than the one provided: \nTo be perfectly honest, in the abstract I don’t know what I would say. Without knowing the circumstances, if \none of those instructors is in her or his first year of teaching, and the other was an experienced professor, I \nthink that interpretation is dramatically different than if they’re both experienced professors or if they’re \nboth new professors. I can say, if we look at the overall averages they’re both scoring in the lower percentile, \nand that sort of data, but to be perfectly honest that means very little to me because I think that \nunderstanding a person’s position is crucial to being able to read any of these numbers (04_AUG_001). \nAdditionally, 18.9% would only follow up with Instructor A to address issues related to their teaching scores, \nand/or to provide supplementary guidance to help them improve their results; 24.3% would follow up with \nboth instructors to discuss their concerns; 8.1% would not follow up with either instructor, due to what they \nconsider a lack of any teaching red flags; and 45.9% still mentioned that since USRI needs to be interpreted in a \ncontextual way, they need to look into the circumstances of both instructors as part of their normal process \n(see Figure 8). \nParticipants also had access to two pieces of reference data when given these case studies. The Tukey fence \nwas not referenced by 81.1% of the participants, even though Instructor A had one score below the Tukey \nfence, and not all participants (5.4%) seemed familiar with its application (see Figure 9). The Test Scoring & \nQuestionnaire Services (TSQS) Office mentioned that they generate diverse reports for different faculties and \ndepartments, and based on that, some participants might not be getting the complete set of data available. \nParticpants were more familiar with quartiles data, however, as 37.8% of participants made explicit reference to \nthem, 13.5% stated departmental expectations regarding USRI scores without making explicit reference to the \nquartiles, and 43.2% did not provide any definite comment (see Figure 10). \n18.9% 24.3% 8.1% 45.9% 5.4% \nFigure 8.

Participant Reference to Quartile Data \nYes Departmental Unclear Not asked \n 15 \nIn general, participants from all faculties other than FOMD use USRI scores and comments (and only a portion \nof FOMD participants reported using this tool) to evaluate teaching. And even when one or two items are \nmainly used as an indicator of effective teaching, most participants try to contextualize their interpretations of \nUSRI results. \n4.2. Use of Additional Tools & Information to Evaluate Teaching \nWhen asked about the use of additional tools and information to evaluate teaching, in-class peer teaching \nobservations were the most commonly implemented resource (70.3%), followed by annual instructor self-\nreflections about their pedagogical practices (37.8%), review of class materials (e.g., syllabi, assignments, and \nexams) (29.7%), and departmental specific tools that have been created to accommodate to the uniqueness of \ntheir departments (21.6%) (see Figure 11). \nHowever, the way these tools are implemented varies between the different departments. Some participants \n(35.1%) only employ additional resources on a voluntary basis, encouraging professors to provide further \ninformation, but reportedly are not able to engage everyone in the department. Another group (27%) uses \nadditional information as a standard in their departments, obtaining it through their departmental specific \ntools, or auditing a manageable section of their professorate each year. Some of them (8.1%) have already \nimplemented yearly departmental audits that include additional tools and information beyond USRI. \nFurthermore, 18.9% only go beyond USRI when they need to evaluate teaching practices of professors going \nup for promotion/tenure; 10.8% only implement additional strategies to assess sessional instructors or new \nprofessors; and 8.1% acknowledged they did not use any additional tools or information (see Figure 12). \nAmong the participants who used additional tools and information in any way, 42.8% used one of the listed \nresources (see Figure 11), 42.8% used two, and 14.4% used three. Nevertheless, most participants share a \n70.3% \n37.8% \n29.7% \n21.6% \nIn-Class Peer Teaching Observations \nAnnual Instructor Self-Reflections \nClass Materials \nDepartmental-Specific Tools \nFigure 11.

Distribution of Additional Tools & Information Use by Faculty \n37.8% \n27.0% \n18.9% \n10.8% \n5.4% \n 16 \ncommon rationale for including other tools recognize the need to include other tools are very much alike, as \none of them mentioned when reflecting on relying exclusively on USRI to evaluate teaching: \nI don’t think that’s very useful by itself, it’s incomplete. I’d feel uncomfortable judging somebody’s fate just \nbased on that. I’m not saying it’s wrong but it’s only one piece. It’s one piece of understanding, and we take \nteaching seriously. It’s not just a bunch of simple numbers pouring at us. We don’t just look at you’re above \nthis number or below this number, and we’re done. We’re looking at you much more carefully than that, but \nit’s a good start (29_BUS_002). \nParticipants, furthermore, also mentioned further tools and information they have utilized in their departments \nto support teaching. For instance, 40.5% have organized peer support initiatives for professors (e.g., mentoring, \nteaching triads, and support groups where instructors find a safe space to talk about their teaching practices). \nAnother 13.5% have referred struggling faculty to departmental specific training and/or workshops, or know of \nother units on campus that offer pedagogical guidance; 13.5% have instituted faculty gatherings in which they \ncasually converse with their instructors over breakfast or brunch issues and/or concerns about their teaching \npractices. Additionally, 8.1% have produced departmental teaching handbooks with best practices to help \nprofessors succeed from the beginning (see Figure 13). \nWhen it comes to bringing these additional tools and information to FEC, 45.9% indicated that they play a role \nin their annual teaching evaluation, mainly by informing their narrative and/or the reasons they provide to \nother FEC members if their recommendation gets challenged; 21.6% of them acknowledged not bringing any \nof these resources to FEC, and 32.4% did not comment or their responses were unclear (see Figure 14). \nThus, even when participants indicated using one or two additional tools to evaluate teaching, most \nacknowledged using them on a voluntary basis, getting them only when their faculty agrees to provide these \nsupplementary resources. Additionally, even when they obtain this information, not all participants bring it to \nFEC. The ones who reportedly bring it to FEC, use it to inform their narrative, and is only explicitly brought up \nwhen there is a challenge to their recommendation. \n40.5% \n13.5% \n13.5% \n8.1% \nPeer Support \nTraining & Workshops \nFaculty Gatherings \nHandbook \nFigure 13.

Perceived FEC Weighting of Teaching, Research & Service \nFROM THIS POINT ON INFORMATION CONSIDERS ALL PARTICIPANTS \nMost participants recognized that there is a strong bias towards research (60.5%), despite their FEC’s best \nefforts to weight them equally (14%) (see Figure 19): \nI would say that there’s still a bias towards research. Although my experience was that teaching was taken \nseriously, and we looked at those things a lot, and they were raised in terms of the kinds of things people \nwere doing, the amount of teaching they were doing, their scores, and all that stuff was taken into \nconsideration, I would still say that the publications and other research activities and outcomes were \nprobably weighed more seriously. So, I’d say it’d be more like 50%, 30%, 20% rather than 40%, 40%, 20% \n(07_AR_001). \nAn additional 14% mentioned that FEC weights the importance of teaching, research and service based on the \nspecific time allocation of the individual (mostly in health-related disciplines where their contracts have \ndifferent time allocations), and 11.6% thought that their FEC weights teaching more heavily than research (see \nFigure 15). \nALES \nA\nL\nE\nS\nBUS ART \nART \nAUG \nEDU \nENG \nE\nN\nG\nFOMD \nFOMD \nF\nO\nM\nD\nRM \nSC ND \nND \nND \nPredominantly Research \nEqually Weighted \nSpecific Time Allocation \nPredominantly Teaching \nFigure 15.

Need for Additional Supports to Better Evaluate Teaching \nMost participants also voiced their urgent need for additional supports to better evaluate teaching. One \nparticipant, for example, remarked that “I was looking to you to find this out, to find out if the result of this survey \nwould give me some ideas of what this is” (24_AR_007); and another commented that in their department “We’re \nhoping the university will solve this issue” (18_ND_002). Indeed, 83.7% of participants mentioned needing some \nsupport, whereas 9.3% indicated not needing additional resources (see Figure 16). \nSome participants explicitly recognized their concerns about depending exclusively on USRI, and what they \nthought to be the inability of USRI to effectively evaluate diverse approaches to teaching (46.5%), other \nmentioned not having enough time and resources to adopt supplementary tools in the teaching evaluation \nprocess (27.9%). Both male and female participants expressed concerns about observing lower USRI scores for \nwomen and visible minorities (11.6%), as well as the difficulties of compelling senior faculty (usually with full \nprofessor rank) to improve their teaching practices (9.3%) (see Figure 17): \nThat question set doesn’t serve the diversity and the kind of pedagogy we have now, and really needs fixing. \nI think there needs to be a conversation about what this is going to look like over time. I also think the \nUniversity has to take very seriously the concerns that equity seeking groups have about what happens in \nteaching evaluations. What happens to women? What happens to visible minority? What happens to people \nthat are perceived to have strong accents? And I think there’s a huge responsibility on chairs and people on \nFEC to really be educated in how much you can extrapolate from USRI (42_EDU_003). \nTSQS conducted descriptive analyses that generated gender-specific USRI scores using data from the academic \nyears 2011/2012 to 2015/2016. Results show there is no overt difference between scores for males (N = \n18576, Mdn = 4.53) and females (N = 13679, Mdn = 4.57) for statement 211. Additionally, TSQS measures the \nreliability of the USRI by comparing medians to the previous academic years.  Our research team was not able \nto find information on the validity of the USRI. \n83.7% 9.3% 7.0% \nFigure 16.

Issues Encountered when Evaluating Teaching \n 19 \nAmong the most commonly listed types of supports to better evaluate teaching, participants mentioned that \nideally, they would implement peer in-class observations not only for promotion purposes, but across their \ndepartment (41.9%), obtain university guidelines to understand how to accurately and effectively evaluate \nteaching (27.9%) (see Figure 18): \nMy learning curve coming in to the chair role has been huge. We used to have a chair’s school kind of thing. \nNow there’s the gold and green leadership college or whatever it’s called, and it’s a very different thing. So, \nyou transition into chair now and you’re on your own. You’ve got to go figure it out, ask people for coffee, \nand learn up, but there’s no orientation to being a chair (42_EDU_003). \nSome also indicated that it would be useful to gain access to teaching training and workshops that they could \nrefer struggling professors to (when not available in their departments) (20.9%), have discipline specific concept \ninventories to better determine the knowledge increase in students (11.6%), implement peer support initiatives \nto improve teaching practices (11.6%), video record lectures for later analysis of the quality of teaching (7%), \nrequest pedagogical self-reflections in which professors give a thoughtful summary of their teaching (7%), and \nreview class materials to have a better panorama of the instructor (4.7%) (see Figure 18). Having more resources \nto better evaluate teaching is important, as one of them mentioned: \nI think we need support to develop our own teaching skills more comfortably so we can be excellent \nteachers, but also it would be important to make sure our instruments are valid and that we can actually \nuse them on a journey of self-improvement, and departmental culture and improvement. And to do that \nhaving some facilitation from people who know the art and who can work with us would be better than just \nhaving a list of stuff on a website where you do click, click, and access what you want. That’s not enough \n(39_MED_009). \n4.5.

Perceived Differences between Evaluation of Teaching for Annual \nReview & Promotion \n68.3% \n26.8% \n4.9% \n 20 \nEven though evaluation of teaching for annual review and for promotion was a different process for 68.3%, and \nthe same process for 26.8% of participants (see Figure 19), both ends of the spectrum seem to agree that more \ncomponents were taking into consideration when they were dealing with promotion: \nThe annual review looks only at that year, and if there’s real concerns then you’ll look for trends, whereas \nwhen it comes to promotion, it looks to a career, what has this individual been doing with teaching, and not \njust this year but intentionally over the entire career. When it comes to application promotion, there is a \nlarger view taken of teaching (09_ENG_002). \n4.6. Characteristics of Effective & Excellent Teachers \nEven though most participants struggled with the breadth of this question, for them an effective and/or \nexcellent teacher appropriately conveys the knowledge and the skills that students need to obtain (58.1%), \nengages students despite the difficulty of the course material (46.5%), gets high USRI scores and teaching \nawards (30.2%), innovates in their teaching practices (23.3%), knows how to challenge students without burning \nthem out (18.6%), regularly updates the information and the material of the course (18.6%), and engages in \nscholarship of teaching and learning related activities (18.6%). Other participants indicated that being \nsupportive of students was also important (14%), seeking professional development opportunities to improve \ntheir pedagogical practices (7%), and learning from students as much as students learn from them (4.7%) (see \nFigure 21): \nI try to avoid definitions if that involves any kind of explicit criteria. What I look for, what I think is most \nimportant in teaching is that all good teaching is transformative. And it’s mostly transformative for the \nstudent, although truth be known good teaching is transformative for both student and teacher \n(16_AR_004). \n4.7.

Characteristics of Effective & Excellent Teachers \n 21 \nMost participants believed that response rates have decreased since the implementation of the e-USRI: 48.6% \nhad some data to back up this claim, such as their personal USRI response rates, or the actual number of \nstudents that now complete the evaluations compared to previous years; and 18.9% believed that the response \nrates had declined, but had no data to support this claim. Alternatively, 21.6% of participants believed there \nwas a similar response rate with both methods of delivery, 8.1% thought that it increased with the switch to \nelectronic, but did not offer data to support this claim (see Figure 21). Moreover, some participants (8.1%) \nbelieved that a major issue with USRI response rates is that students are asked to complete a large amount of \nassessments: \nI think they get completely annoyed because they’re being bombarded with e-mails in their last week of \nclasses reminding them to do USRIs, and professors reminding them to do USRIs to the point where I think \nthey just go: I’m really annoyed. I’m not going to do them at all. I don’t know what kind of a system they use \nto send them out, but it’s almost like they send out one for every class, for every student, so they’re just \nharassing them to death and they get mad about it (27_ALES_001). \n18.9% 48.6% 21.6% 8.1% \n2\n.7\n%\nFigure 21.

Conclusions \nHow are the USRIs and other tools used in the evaluation of teaching evaluation at the University of \nAlberta? \n Participants from all faculties other than FOMD use USRI scores and comments (and only a \nportion of participants from FOMD) to evaluate teaching. \n Statement 221 (overall the instructor was excellent), and statement 25 (overall the quality of the \ncourse content was excellent) are the most commonly used USRI items to evaluate teaching. \n Most participants try to conceptualize their interpretation of USRI results. \nWhat are some approaches for multi-faceted evaluation of teaching? \n In-class peer teaching observations were the most commonly used additional source of information, \nfollowed by annual instructor pedagogical self-reflections. \n Most participants obtain these resources on a voluntary basis, only when professors agree to give \nthem these supplementary resources. \n Some participants have implemented yearly faculty audits, in which a manageable portion of their \nprofessorate’s teaching is evaluated using additional information. \n Even when participants obtain these resources, not all reported to bring them to FEC. When this \ninformation makes it to FEC, it is used to inform their narrative, and is only explicitly brought up \nwhen there is a challenge. \n Participants recognized that there is still a strong bias towards research at their respective FEC. \n Most participants voiced their need for additional supports to better evaluate teaching. \n They have identified some issues when evaluating teaching exclusively with USRI, and possible \nalternatives to supplement these scores, but still they hope the institution provides a solution for \ntheir concerns. \n 24 \n 25 \n6.
