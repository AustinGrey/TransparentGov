Over the years, there has been a significant amount of \nconfusion when the parties have attempted to interpret the Copyright \nRegulations as it is not clear from the language when the University \nwould own copyright and when it would be owned by the staff member.  \nThe generally accepted practice (although not strictly based on the \nlanguage) has been to acknowledge that academic staff own the \ncopyright in their teaching materials, but the University has some sort of \nItem No. 4 \nGFC COMMITTEE ON THE LEARNING ENVIRONMENT \nFor the Meeting of April 6, 2016 \nlimited license to use that material. \nIn 2010, the University of Alberta and the AASUA agreed to form an \n“Agreement Review Committee” that would examine two aspects of \nintellectual property: a) copyright and b) the emerging issue of \nintellectual property that is not covered by patent or copyright practices.  \nThe ARC that was created has focused solely on the first issue - \ncopyright.  This ARC has been meeting regularly since and has \ndeveloped proposed new Copyright Regulations which would replace the \nexisting regulations in their entirety.  The ARC believes that the new \nlanguage creates greater certainty as it relates to copyright ownership \nand use.   \nThe key elements of the proposed new Regulations include: \n1.    Clear ownership by academic staff of copyright in works they create \nas a result of or connected with their duties or employment. \n2.    An immediate, non-exclusive, royalty-free, non-transferable and \nirrevocable license to the University to use these works for purposes \nrelated to its approved mandate. \n3.    A more limited license to the University to use a staff member’s \ndetailed teaching materials, for example if the staff member is unable or \nunavailable to deliver all or part of a course assigned to that staff \nmember during that academic year. \n4.    Ownership by the University of copyright of works created by a staff \nmember in the course of performing administrative or management \nduties or activities.   \n5.     A clear statement that a staff member’s copyright in works created \nas part of a sponsored research agreement is governed by the terms of \nthat agreement.  This gives the University the right to alter copyright \nownership in a sponsored research agreement, the way it is currently \nable to be done for Patentable Intellectual Property. \n*It is important to note that the proposed Regulations deal with copyright \nthat is created by a University of Alberta academic staff member in \nperforming his employment duties.  It does not apply to the use by the \nUniversity of copyright materials from other sources (textbooks, library \nbooks, online sources, etc).  There is a separate policy suite being \ndrafted that deals with such issues. \nAlignment/Compliance \nAlignment with Guiding \nDocuments \nDare to Discover, Dare to Deliver, Comprehensive Institutional Plan,  \nacademic collective agreements \nCompliance with Legislation, \nPolicy and/or Procedure \nRelevant to the Proposal \n(please quote legislation and \ninclude identifying section \nnumbers) \n1.  Post-Secondary Learning Act (PSLA):  Alberta’s Post-Secondary \nLearning Act (PSLA) gives the Board of Governors the authority to \n“develop, manage and operate, alone or in co-operation with any person \nor organization, programs, services and facilities for the educational or \ncultural advancement of the people of Alberta” (Section 60(1)).  \nItem No. 4 \nGFC COMMITTEE ON THE LEARNING ENVIRONMENT \nFor the Meeting of April 6, 2016 \nFurther, the Board of Governors “must consider the recommendations of \nthe general faculties council, if any, on matters of academic import prior \nto providing for […] any other activities the board considers necessary or \nadvantageous”  (Section 19(e)). \n2.  Post-Secondary Learning Act (PSLA):  Section 26(1) states that, \n“[s]ubject to the authority of the board, a general faculties council is \nresponsible for the academic affairs of the university and, without \nrestricting the generality of the foregoing, has the authority to […] \n(o) make recommendations to the board with respect to affiliation with \nother institutions, academic planning, campus planning, a building \nprogram, the budget, the regulation of residences and dining halls, \nprocedures in respect of appointments, promotions, salaries, tenure and \ndismissals, and any other matters considered by the general faculties \ncouncil to be of interest to the university […].” \nFurther, the PSLA, states in Section 31(1) that “[t]he general faculties \ncouncil has general supervision of student affairs at a university […].” \n3.

[…] \ni) To consider any matter deemed by the GFC Committee on the \nLearning Environment to be within the purview of its general \nresponsibility.” \n4. GFC Academic Planning Committee Terms of Reference (3. \nMandate of the Committee) \n“The Academic Planning Committee (APC) is GFC’s senior committee \ndealing with academic, financial and planning issues. As such, it is not \nonly responsible to GFC (or the Board) for the specific matters itemized \nbelow, but may also ask to consider or recommend to GFC on any \nacademic issue, including: 1) those issues under the purview of other \nGFC committees, 2) any academic issue related to restructuring, 3) any \nresearch-related issue, or 4) issues linked to academic service units \nwhere those issues have a significant academic impact. In like manner, \nthe President, Provost and Vice-President (academic) or other Vice-\nPresidents may refer any matter to APC for consideration or \nrecommendation to GFC. APC is also responsible to GFC for promoting \nan optimal learning environment for students and excellence in teaching, \nresearch, and graduate studies. (GFC 29 SEP 2003)” \n5. GFC Executive Committee Terms of Reference (3. Mandate of the \nCommittee) \n“5. Agendas of General Faculties Council \nGFC has delegated to the Executive Committee the authority to decide \nwhich items are placed on a GFC Agenda, and the order in which those \nagenda items appear on each GFC agenda. […] \nItem No. 4 \nGFC COMMITTEE ON THE LEARNING ENVIRONMENT \nFor the Meeting of April 6, 2016 \nWhen recommendations are forwarded to General Faculties Council \nfrom APC, the role of the Executive shall be to decide the order in which \nitems should be considered by GFC. The Executive Committee is \nresponsible for providing general advice to the Chari about proposals \nbeing forwarded from APC to GFC.” \n6.  Board Learning and Discovery Committee Terms of Reference \n(3. Mandate of the Committee) \n“Except as provided in paragraph 4 hereof and in the Board’s General \nCommittee Terms of Reference, the Committee shall, in accordance with \nthe Committee’s responsibilities with powers granted under the Post-\nSecondary Learning Act, monitor, evaluate, advise and make decisions \non behalf of the Board with respect to matters concerning the teaching \nand research affairs of the University, including proposals coming from \nthe administration and from General Faculties Council (the “GFC”), and \nshall consider future educational expectations and challenges to be \nfaced by the University.  The Committee shall also include any other \nmatter delegated to the Committee by the Board. \nWithout limiting the generality of the foregoing the Committee shall: \na. review and approve initiatives related to the overall academic \nmission and related plans and policies of the University; b. review, \nprovide feedback and approve teaching and research policies[.] […]” \n7. Board Human Resources and Compensation Committee (3. \nMandate of the Committee) \n“Except as provided in paragraph 4 and in the Board’s General \nCommittee Terms of Reference, the Committee shall monitor, evaluate, \nadvise and make decisions on behalf of the Board with respect to, and \nthe Board delegates to the Committee responsibility and authority for, all \npolicies and procedures affecting staff working condition sat the \nUniversity and matters for collective bargaining and related service \ncontracts.

The composition of the ARC’s membership has \nchanged significantly over time; the Vice-President (Research) has been \na member from the beginning, as has Geoffrey Rockwell (Department of \nPhilosophy). They have provided important continuity to the discussions \nover the past six years. \nDuring 2010, before detailed discussions began, a review of the \ncopyright regulations of some of the University’s peer institutions in \nCanada (McGill, UBC, University of Toronto) and the US (University of \nItem No. 4 \nGFC COMMITTEE ON THE LEARNING ENVIRONMENT \nFor the Meeting of April 6, 2016 \nWisconsin, University of Michigan, Penn State) was carried out.  This \nprovided important context for the discussion about possible changes to \nthe University’s copyright regulations. \nWhile significant work was done by email between meetings, the ARC \nmet face to face on the following dates: December 20, 2010; February \n16, 2011; February 28, 2011; April 1, 2011; April 26, 2011; December \n19, 2011; February 14, 2012; October 26, 2012; May 14, 2013; June 19, \n2013; October 28, 2013; September 5, 2014; October 17, 2014; and \nDecember 11, 2014. A significant portion of 2015 was taken up with \nfinalizing the wording of the Copyright Regulations as well as drafting \nand finalizing a series of Frequently Asked Questions which will be \nposted on the AASUA website following the approval of the new \nCopyright Regulations. The Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) was \nsigned on February 26, 2016. \nThere will be a parallel approval process, involving both the AASUA \nmembership as well as GFC/Board.  The approval route noted below is \nfor GFC/Board, which is the responsibility of administration. \nApproval Route (Governance) \n(including meeting dates) \nGFC Committee on the Learning Environment (for recommendation) – \nApril 6, 2016 \nGFC Academic Planning Committee (for recommendation) – April 20, \n2016 \nGFC Executive Committee – May 16, 2016 \nGeneral Faculties Council – May 30, 2016 \nBoard Human Resources and Compensation Committee – May 31, 2016 \nBoard Learning and Discovery Committee – June 2, 2016 \nBoard of Governors – June 17, 2016 \nFinal Approver Board of Governors \nAttachments (each to be numbered 1 - <>) \n1.

What prompted the creation of the Agreement Review Committee (ARC) and the \ndrafting of the new Copyright Regulations? \n When the Association of Academic Staff negotiated the patent policy with the Board of \nGovernors, it was recognized that the collective agreement provisions regarding copyright \nneeded substantial revision.  Under the Post-secondary Learning Act of Alberta, whatever rights \nstaff have as individuals to their creative work is governed by the collective agreements between \nthe AASUA and the Board. As was seen at the time of the patent review, the current language is \nquite opaque and in need of revision.  Recognizing the need for change, the Board and AASUA \nagreed to form an “Agreement Review Committee” that would examine provisions of our \ncollective agreements regarding copyright, and to review two aspects of intellectual property: \ncopyright and the emerging issue of intellectual property that is not covered by patent or \ncopyright practices. The membership of this ARC has changed over time, but both the Board and \nthe AASUA are pleased to bring forward new Copyright Regulations.  \n2. Why did this process take so long? \n Due to the membership of the ARC and various members going on sabbatical leave or \nunable to serve on the ARC due to their work responsibilities, it was difficult to schedule \nmeetings.  It also took time to deliberate on the issues and to write language that was agreeable \nto both sides. \n3. What are the key principles underlying the new Copyright Regulations?  \nFirst, the idea was to replace confusing and out of date language in the academic staff collective \nagreements with language that would provide academic staff and the Board with clear guidance \non the subject.   \nSecond, the idea was to replace language asserting that the Board owns the copyright of staff \nworks in Article 10 with language starting with the principle that staff own the copyright to their \nwork, with some exceptions, discussed below.  \nThird, we wanted to add protections to ensure that the Board would have a license to use the \nwork of staff to do its core business in certain circumstances.   \nFourth, we settled on the principle benefiting both parties that in cases where the University \nneeded ongoing access to copyrighted materials, a non-exclusive license would allow staff to do \nwhat they wanted with materials they created even if they leave the University, while still \nallowing the University to continue to use key materials for specific purposes.  \nPage 2 of 7 \n4. If we didn’t have a collective agreement, who would own copyright in works \nproduced by academic staff in the course of their duties? \nIn the absence of provisions within a collective agreement, the Board of Governors – not \nacademic staff - would own the copyright to Works that “result from” or “are connected with”, \nstaff members’ duties or employment.  Section 68 of the Post-Secondary Learning Act provides \nas follows: \n68(1)  Unless otherwise agreed to by the board, the ownership of any invention, work, \ninformation or material, regardless of form, including any patent, copyright, \ntechnological or industrial design process or trademark acquired or produced by an \nofficer of the post‑secondary institution or an employee of the board that results \nfrom or is connected with the officer’s or employee’s duties or employment vests in \nthe board and may be made available to the public under conditions, on payment of fees \nor royalties or otherwise, as the board may determine. \n(2)  The board may compensate a person described in subsection (1). \n(3)  The board may enter into an agreement with a person to whom the board has \nprovided or proposes to provide facilities, equipment or financial aid providing for the \nrespective rights, obligations and liabilities of the board and the person with respect to the \nownership of any invention, work, information or material, regardless of form, including \nany patent, copyright, technological or industrial design process or trademark acquired or \nproduced by the person while engaged in a project funded in whole or in part by the \nboard. \n5. To what creative products do the Copyright Regulations apply?  What counts as a \n“Work”? \nFor the purposes of the Copyright Regulations, a Work is any creative product respecting which \ncopyright is recognized under the Copyright Act. Very generally, copyright applies to original \nliterary, dramatic, musical or artistic works – regardless of format or technology of presentation \n(digital movies as much as handwritten plays).  Copyright also applies (for example) to \n“performers’ performances,” which would include lectures. \nThe Regulations would also apply, for example, to online course products, such as “MOOCs”.  \nKeep in mind, though, that these sorts of projects can be expensive and involve many parties.  It \nwould be very likely that intellectual property rights will be dealt with by the contract(s) that \nestablish the project (see 1.5, 5).  If a staff member chooses to enter into these sorts of contracts, \nthe terms of the contracts shall govern copyright ownership.   \nThe Copyright Regulations do not apply to creative products that are not governed by the \nCopyright Act, such as inventions that fall under the Patent Policy, industrial designs, or \ntrademarks. \nPage 3 of 7 \n6. What are the main elements of the Copyright Regulations? \nBasic rule – paragraph 1.1:  a staff member who creates a Work resulting from or connected with \nthe staff member’s duties or employment owns copyright in the work, with some exceptions \ndiscussed below. \nAt the same time, Works are licensed to the University – paragraph 2.1:  the University is \nentitled to a licence (details about this below) to a Work referred to in paragraph 1.1, for all \npurposes within the University’s approved mandate under the PSLA. \nExceptions to the University’s licence are referred to in paragraphs 2.1 – 2.6:  the licence \ndoes not apply to any Work created by a staff member “to fulfill assigned course \nresponsibilities” (details about this below – the point:  no paragraph 2.1 licence to teaching \nmaterials). \nDespite those exceptions, and in specified circumstances, the University has limited rights to use \neven materials described in paragraphs 2.6 – 2.8, 2.9 (and paragraph 2.10 for some categories of \nAcademic staff):  e.g., if a staff member is unavailable or unable to deliver all or part of a course \nduly assigned to the staff member (the University’s rights will be only for the duration of the \ncourse for that academic year) \n7. Are there any situations in which an academic staff member would not own \ncopyright in a Work that he or she produced in connection with employment duties? \nThere are situations in which a staff member would not own copyright in a Work produced in \nconnection with job responsibilities.   \nUnder paragraph 1.4, a staff member would not have copyright in Work produced – generally – \nfor administrative purposes.  While 1.4 provides some context, guidance may also be provided \nby the “frequently asked questions” that will be prepared. \nParagraph 1.5 recognizes that a staff member may create a Work pursuant to a written agreement \n– he or she may be hired by the University to produce some creative product.  Intellectual \nproperty rights respecting that creative product will be addressed in the agreement. \nParagraph 1.6 recognizes that some types of research funding have provisions respecting \nintellectual property ownership – a condition of receiving the funding is complying with the \nintellectual property aspects of the arrangement.  It may be that under the terms of a funding \narrangement, the funder is to hold copyright in works produced with the research funding.  The \nUniversity, as intermediary between the researcher and the funder, may “obtain from the staff \nmember an assignment or licence of the copyright as necessary to fulfill [the University’s] \nobligations to the sponsor under the sponsored research funding agreement.” \nParagraph 1.7 recognizes that a staff member may – e.g., during a secondment – create Works \npursuant to a contract between the University and a third party.  In these cases, copyright \nownership and licensing are governed by such agreements. \nPage 4 of 7 \n8. Do the Copyright Regulations recognize “moral rights”? \nYes.  “Moral rights,” generally, are rights to claim authorship, to remain anonymous, or to use a \npseudonym; the right of integrity (the right to resist distortion or modification of a work that is \nprejudicial to the honour or reputation of the creator); and the right of association (the right to \nresist the use of a work in association with a product, service, cause, or institution, if such use \nwould be prejudicial to the honour or reputation of the creator). \nMoral rights are recognized in paragraph 1.3. \nAdditionally, paragraph 2.5 describes an academic type of moral right:  A staff member who \nreasonably believes that his or her Work is unsatisfactory for a proposed use because it is \noutdated, it is incomplete, its use would have a negative effect on the professional reputation of \nthe staff member, or there are “other academic grounds” to oppose its use, “may amend the Work \nor require that its use be withheld.  This right is an express limitation to the University’s \nparagraph 2.1 licence. \n9. What is the nature of the University’s licence to use Works created by academic \nstaff, referred to in paragraph 2.1? \nThe licence is  \n(a) “immediate” – it comes into existence when the Work comes into existence; no (e.g.) \nwritten licence agreement is necessary; \n(b) “non-exclusive” – the staff member may grant licences to use the Work to others; \n(c) “royalty free” – the staff member is not paid royalties for the University’s use of the \nWork (this is because – the Work having been created in the course of employment duties – the \nUniversity has supported its production financially); \n(d) “non-transferrable” – the University cannot transfer its licence to a third party (e.g. some \nsort of third party educational services provider); and \n(e) “irrevocable” – the staff member can’t unilaterally cancel the licence. \nThe licence is a right or permission to use the Work “for all purposes within the University’s \napproved mandate” under the PSLA.  Paragraph 2.2 provides some examples of these purposes. \nParagraph 2.4 recognizes that a staff member may agree to grant additional licence rights to the \nUniversity. \nPage 5 of 7 \n10. What if, as a condition of publication, a publisher requires the assignment of \ncopyright from the creator?  \nUnder paragraph 2.3, if a publisher requires the assignment of copyright to the publisher as a \ncondition of publishing, then the staff member has no copyright to licence to the University.  The \nparagraph 2.1 licence, then, does not arise.  The staff member is required to make “best efforts” \nto have a licence analogous to the paragraph 2.1 licence extended to the University.   Best efforts \nis assessed within the context of the situation.  It requires doing that which is known to be usual, \nnecessary and proper in attempting to secure the objective.  \n11. Are there any Works – besides those referred to in paragraph 2.3 – respecting \nwhich the University does not have a paragraph 2.1 licence? \nYes.  Generally, paragraph 2.6 excludes teaching materials from the paragraph 2.1 licence, with \ncertain exceptions (see question 13). \n12. But are there any circumstances in which the University could have a licence even to \nteaching materials? \nYes, in defined circumstances: \n(a) Under paragraph 2.7, the paragraph 2.1 licence extends to course outlines – but only \nconcerning those elements of a course outline that set out information required by GFC Policy \n(that is, the paragraph 2.7 exception does not capture a full syllabus or course readings and \ntopics). \n(b) Under paragraph 2.8, if a staff member is unable or unavailable to deliver all or part of a \ncourse duly assigned to that staff member, the University may use that staff member’s teaching \nmaterials to complete the delivery of the course.  This clause would apply, for example, if a staff \nmember died, became ill, or quit – the University would be under an obligation to registered \nstudents to finish the course, and the staff member’s materials could be used to do so.  The \nparagraph 2.8 licence is good for the duration of the academic year in question only.  Note that it \nonly applies if a course has been “duly assigned.”  The University could not – for example – use \nan instructor’s materials to deliver a course without having first assigned that instructor to that \ncourse. \n(c) Under paragraph 2.9, “[t]he University may use a Work described in paragraph 2.6 for \nthe purposes of unit accreditation, in connection with transfer credit determinations or as the \nUniversity may be required to meet its obligations to students.” \n13. What does paragraph 3.1 – which deals with computer programs – mean? \nHuman generated computer code (software), which gives rise to computer programs, are \ncopyright-protected.  In some cases, however, the integration of software in inventions may be \nprotected under patent rules.  Hence, not only copyright but patent rules may apply “to software \nPage 6 of 7 \nthat is patentable intellectual property.”  If a computer program is not patentable it remains \nprotected by copyright law only. \n14. What if a staff member uses his or her copyright-protected works to provide \neducational services for a competitor University? \nThe Copyright Regulations deal with copyright ownership. Use of copyright protected materials \nis still subject to the collective agreements, University policies and procedures, and the general \nlaw.  The point of paragraph 4.1 is that staff members’ use of copyright protected works is \nsubject to the University’s conflict of commitment and conflict of interest policy. \n15. What happens if a Work is created through the efforts of University personnel, (e.g.) \na grad supervisor and a student, or an academic staff member and a non-academic staff \nmember? \nParagraph 5.1 acknowledges that Works created collaboratively” present special challenges \nregarding copyright.”  Paragraph 5.2 - if the creators are University personnel, the relevant \nprovisions of policies, procedures and collective agreements (including the Copyright \nRegulations) will apply.  Paragraph 5.3 - if a written agreement is in place with third parties, then \nthat agreement will apply, or the general law in the absence of such an agreement.  Given the \nchallenges, potential collaborators should consider copyright ownership issues as soon as \npossible and consider entering a written agreement to deal with ownership issues before starting \nthe collaboration. \n16. How do the Copyright Regulations govern staff members’ intellectual property \nrights with third parties? \nThe Copyright Regulations govern the relationship between staff members as employees, and the \nBoard as their employer, under the collective agreements.  Ownership of Works created by staff \nwith or for publishers, external collaborators, funders, and (e.g.) the Tri-Council is determined by \na combination of the terms of the Copyright Regulations and the terms of the agreements with \nthose third parties (see paragraphs 1.6, 1.7 and 5.3). \nIt is important to note that copyright law is not the only area of law that applies to copyrighted \nWorks.  For example, the law of defamation) also applies to uses of copyrighted Works. \n17. Who do I contact if I have questions about my rights in a copyrighted work? \nThe AASUA should be your first point of contact, and is available to assist its members in \ndiscussions with University representatives on questions which may arise relating to rights to a \ncopyrighted work. \n18. Why is paragraph 2.10 included in the CAS:T, SOTS and TRAS agreements only? \nIt was recognized that in certain circumstances the University needs to be able to assign to these \ncategories of staff members the creation of “multi-course” or “multi-section” materials, with the \nPage 7 of 7 \nUniversity obtaining a license to use such materials in the future.  The more temporary nature of \nappointments under these agreements means the University needs to ensure it has the right to \ncontinue to use such materials past the end date of a staff member’s appointment. \n19. Why does the CAS:T agreement make reference to the length of the license back to the \nUniversity? \nSince CAS:T representatives on AASUA Council felt that limiting the duration that the \nUniversity could use their material for continuing teaching was important, the University agreed \nto their request to limit the length of the license to three years.   \n5 March 2016 \nItem No. 5 \nGFC COMMITTEE ON THE LEARNING ENVIRONMENT \nFor the Meeting of April 6, 2016 \nOUTLINE OF ISSUE \nAgenda Title: First Draft: Institutional Strategic Plan  \nMotion:  N/A \nItem   \nAction Requested Approval Recommendation  Discussion/Advice Information \nProposed by David H.

The University \nof Alberta gives a national and international voice to innovation in our province, taking a lead role \nin placing Canada at the global forefront.\nValues\nThe University of Alberta community of students, faculty, staff, and alumni rely on shared, deeply \nheld values that guide behaviour and actions. These values are drawn from the principles on \nwhich the University of Alberta was founded in 1908 and reflect a dynamic, modern institution of \nhigher learning, leading change nationally and internationally.\nAbove all, we value intellectual integrity, freedom of inquiry and expression, and the equality \nand dignity of all persons as the foundation of ethical conduct in research, teaching, learning, \nand service.\nWe value excellence in teaching, research, and creative activity that enriches learning \nexperiences, advances knowledge, inspires engaged citizenship, and promotes the public good.\nWe value learners at all stages of life and strive to provide an intellectually rewarding educational \nenvironment for all.\nWe value academic freedom and institutional autonomy as fundamental to open inquiry and the \npursuit of truth.\nWe value diversity, inclusivity, and equity across and among our people, campuses, and \ndisciplines.\nWe value creativity and innovation from the genesis of ideas through to the dissemination of \nknowledge.\nWe value history and tradition, celebrating the contributions of students, alumni, faculty, staff, \nvolunteers, Indigenous peoples, and other groups, which bring pride to the university.\n4\nU N I V E R S I T Y  O F  A L B E R T A\nAt the University of Alberta, we begin with people—people with ideas, \ntalent, and purpose. Then, we act.\nWe seek knowledge. We educate citizens. We ask the big questions. We push the limits of \nhuman understanding and knowledge. We engage with partners and communities close to home \nand around the world to lead positive change. We empower creative people to take risks and \nexperiment.\nWhy? The answer is simple: We are a public university acting for the public good.\nWhen we act, we provide meaningful educational experiences, promote innovative thinking, \nand develop compelling and relevant solutions that matter. When we lead, we tackle the most \nimportant local, national, and global challenges. When we excel, our work sparks and feeds \nwidespread social, cultural, and economic benefits for others—indeed for the uplifting of the \nwhole people.\nIn For the Public Good—our institutional strategic plan for the coming decade—we embrace and \naffirm our vision to inspire the human spirit through outstanding achievements in learning, \ndiscovery, and citizenship in a creative community, building one of the world’s great universities \nfor the public good.\nWe forge ahead, motivated and supported by the University of Alberta’s 108-year history of \nleadership, achievement, and public service. Inspired by the goals and aspirations in this plan, \nwe will:\nBUILD a diverse, inclusive community of exceptional students, faculty, and \nstaff from Alberta, Canada, and the world.\nEXPERIENCE diverse and rewarding learning opportunities that inspire \nus, nurture our talents, expand our knowledge and skills, and enable our \nsuccess. \nEXCEL as individuals, and together, sustain a culture that fosters and \nchampions distinction and distinctiveness in teaching, learning, research, \nand service.\nENGAGE communities across campuses, the province, Canada, and the \nworld to create reciprocal, mutually beneficial learning experiences, \nresearch projects, partnerships, and collaborations.\nSUSTAIN our people, our work, and the environment by attracting and \nstewarding the resources we need to deliver excellence to the benefit of all.\nIn pursuit of these shared goals, the University of Alberta will deepen our dedication to excellence \nand extend our record of public leadership, playing a lead role in building a better province, a \nbetter Canada, and a better world.\nD\nR\nAFT\n5\nI N S T I T U T I O N A L  S T R A T E G I C  P L A N  -  M A R C H  2 0 1 6 \nThe University of Alberta is Alberta’s educator, generator of new ideas, and engine of social, \ncultural, and economic prosperity. Created by one of the first acts of the legislature, our \nuniversity is one of the province’s most enduring and vital public institutions. As our name \nsuggests, our history is bound to that of Alberta; we acknowledge with pride that we stand on \nTreaty 6 Territory, the traditional gathering place of First Nations, Métis, and Inuit peoples.  \nFor more than a century, University of Alberta scholars have inspired graduates to become \npurposeful, active citizens and leaders. Our alumni—now numbering more than 275,000—\nhave founded more than 70,000 organizations and businesses around the world, creating \none and a half million jobs, nearly 400,000 in Alberta.

It is difficult to accurately represent in an organizational chart the manner in which business flows through the University of Alberta’s academic governance system. For that reason, those \ninterested in learning more are referred to the appropriate source documents, including the Post-Secondary Learning Act, GFC’s Terms of Reference, the General Terms of Reference for GFC\nStanding Committees, and the individual GFC Standing Committee Terms of Reference for details on roles/responsibilities and delegations of authority.\n2. The GFC Executive Committee has been distinguished in this chart given its central role in setting the Agendas for all GFC meetings.  That said, not all academic business flows up to and is\nconsidered by GFC; in some instances, certain GFC Standing Committees have delegated authority to make final decisions or to recommend directly to the Board of Governors..\n3. The GFC Replenishment Committee’s sole function is to replenish the GFC Executive Committee (which functions, too, as GFC’s Nominating Committee).  As such, nominee slates go directly \nfrom GFC RC to GFC.\nItem 5 - Attachment 3\nPage 1 of 8 \nGFC STANDING COMMITTEE DESCRIPTIONS  \nThe Post-Secondary Learning Act (PSLA) gives General Faculties Council (GFC) responsibility, subject to the \nauthority of the Board of Governors, over \"academic affairs\" (section 26(1)).

The GFC PRB may confirm, reverse or vary the decision \nunder appeal, including establishing conditions for entry, continuation, or re-entry to the Practicum; it may also \nvary any terms or conditions previously imposed by the Dean or the FPRC.   \nThe GFC PRB is the final level of appeal within the University for students appealing practicum intervention \ndecisions.  The decision of the GFC PRB is final and binding and the only recourse available to a student who is \nunsatisfied with a decision would be an application for judicial review with the Provincial courts. \nMembership:  The GFC PRB comprises one Faculty member who serves as Chair for a hearing, drawn from \neither the University Appeal Board (UAB) or GFC Academic Appeals Committee (AAC) Panel of Chairs; one \nFaculty member from the FPRC; one practitioner from the discipline or field relevant to the appeal; and two \nGFC-elected student members drawn from either the GFC AAC or UAB Panel of Students. \nContact: Mr Michael Peterson, Appeals and Compliance Officer, University Governance \nNormal Meeting Time:  Appeal hearings occur throughout the year and are scheduled as needed, normally in \nthe evening, to ensure availability of all participants in the hearing. \nAssociated Legislation:  The Post-Secondary Learning Act gives GFC responsibility, subject to the authority of \nthe Board of Governors, over \"academic affairs\" (section 26(1)) and over student appeals (section 26(1)(h)). \nSection 31 of the Act states that GFC has general supervision of student affairs at the University including the \nright to discipline, fine, suspend, or expel students.

L. A.; Stevens, D. D. \nJournal of Public Affairs Education \n2013, Vol. 19, Issue 3, p. 537-558 \nNice summary in the lit review section called “Benefits of Midterm Student Feedback” \n• As well, the online administration of midterm student feedback can potentially generate \neven higher ratings for faculty given the ease of use, the associated anonymity, and the \ntimely receipt by faculty for quick response to students. \n• Instructors are viewed as receptive to students’ learning needs, students may act in kind by \nrewarding instructors with more favorable end-of-course evaluations, and instructors become \nmore adept at teaching. \nFurther, not only does the MSF survey serve as a modality for continuing to refine courses given \nstudent feedback, but by making the necessary midcourse corrections at the midpoint of a course for \nthe timely redirection of student learning, it increased the probability of more favorable end-of-term \ncourse evaluations for faculty.  \nFaculty and Student Perceptions of the Effects of Mid-Course Evaluations on Learning and \nTeaching \nRansom, W. \nAll Theses and Dissertations. \n2009 \n• Meta analyses that have been conducted on ratings show that feedback received early in \nthe semester, such as midcourse evaluation feedback can yield a ten percent increase in \nend-of-semester evaluation scores. When this feedback is combined with consultation \nfrom an instructional developer, end-of-semester evaluation scores can rise up to 45 \npercent. \n• Further, 45 percent of the students surveyed said they would rate their professor higher at \nthe end of the semester on the online student ratings because their faculty member \nconducted a midcourse evaluation. Based on the quantitative data, as well as the \nqualitative data, conducting a mid-course evaluation improves teaching. \n• Faculty members who read the student feedback and did not discuss it with their students \nsaw a 2 percent improvement in their teaching (based on online student rating scores). \nFaculty members who read the feedback, discussed it with students, and did not make \nchanges saw a 5 percent improvement. Faculty members who read the feedback and \ndiscussed it with my students saw an 8 percent improvement. Finally, faculty members \nwho did the most with their mid-course evaluations saw the greatest amount of \nimprovement. Specifically, the faculty members who conducted the mid-course, read the \nfeedback, discussed it with their students, and made changes saw a 9 percent \nimprovement. Essentially, just by taking those four simple steps, faculty members \ncould see nearly a 10 percent improvement in their online student ratings. \nMidterm Student Feedback: Results of a Pilot Study \nSnooks, M. K.; Neeley, S. E.; Revere, L. \nJournal on Excellence in College Teaching \n2007, Vol. 18, Issue 3, p. 55-73 \nI’m trying to get the full version of this article. I will let you know as soon as I get an answer \nfrom the library. It seems to address exactly what you need. Here’s the abstract: \n• The authors investigated the effect of midterm student feedback on final ratings of \ncollege teaching and courses. Students reported increases in both their learning and \nsatisfaction, and their ratings of both instructors and courses increased. This research \nshows that midterm student feedback is likely to have a positive effect on students' \nevaluations and is a beneficial addition to other types of evaluations of teaching \nperformance. \nEffectiveness of Student-Rating Feedback for Improving College Instruction: A Meta-\nAnalysis of Findings \nCohen, P. A. \nResearch in Higher Education \n1980, Vol. 13, Issue 4, p. 321-341 \n• In the typical implementation, feedback raised instructors' end-of-term overall rating by \n.16 of a rating point, or over one-third of a standard deviation. In addition to this overall \neffect, feedback led to increased end-of-term ratings for two of the six teaching \ndimensions, skill and feedback to students. \n• For the present collection of studies, feedback on the average raised instructors9 skill \nratings by almost a half standard deviation, a moderate effect. The feedback to students \ndimension measures the instructor's concern with the quality of students' work. \n• Students whose instructors received midterm rating feed-back did not learn more than \nstudents whose instructors did not receive feedback. This is evidenced by both students' \nself-report of learning and their scores on achievement measures. \nMidterm feedback from students: its relationship to instructional improvement and \nstudents' cognitive and affective outcomes \nOverall, J. U.; Marsh, H. W. \nJournal of Educational Psychology \n1979, Vol. 71, p856-865 \n• Students whose instructors received feedback at midterm rated their instructors higher, as \na group, by the end of the term than students whose instructors did not receive such \nfeedback. \n• These results provide a reasonable basis for assuming that instructors found the feedback \nmechanism a useful source of information on which to base (a) assessments of their own \ninstructional effectiveness by mid term and (b) plans for changes in their conduct of the \nclass responsive to student needs. \n\tItem-1-Agenda-LEA-AP06-2016\n\tItem-4-Copyright\n\tcopyright regulations oi for cle 23mr16\n\tCopyright MOA Fully-Signed Original 26fe16\n\tFAQs Copyright Argreement revised 05mr16 (1)\n\tItem-5-ISP-First-Draft\n\tItem 5-ISP - OI (First Draft)\n\tItem-5-Draft-ISP\n\tItem-6-Review-of-ToR-delegated-authority\n\t6-CLE-review of ToR and delegations-OI\n\t6-ToR-Committee-on-the-Learning-Environment\n\t6-Att-2-GFC-committees\n\tAtt 3a - GFC Org Chart Jan29'16\n\tSlide Number 1\n\tAtt 3b - GFC Standing Committee Descriptions and Relevant legislation Jan29'16\n\tItem-7-Formative-Feedback\n\t7a-OI-Formative-Feedback\n\tMidterm feedback and higher end-of-term evaluations\n\tUSRIs +: Research on End-of-term course ratings when coupled with formative feedback\n",
