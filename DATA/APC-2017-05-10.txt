All material \neconomic, environmental or fiscal implications of which we are aware have been considered in \nthe preparation of this report. \nMichael Phair \nChair, Board of Governors \n 6 \nMESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT \nAt the University of Alberta, we begin with people—people with ideas, talent, and purpose. \nThen, we act.  We seek knowledge. We educate citizens. We ask the big questions. We push \nthe limits of human understanding and knowledge. We engage with partners and communities \nclose to home and around the world to lead positive change. We empower creative people to \ntake risks and make imaginative leaps towards as yet undetermined futures. \nWhy? The answer is simple: We are a public university acting for the public good. \n       -For the Public Good \nAt the mid-point of the 2016-2017 year, the University of Alberta community affirmed our \ncommitment to serving the public good at the launch of our new institutional strategic plan in \nSeptember 2016. Called For the Public Good, our plan outlines the goals we are pursuing and \nthe strategies we must enact to fulfill our vision to inspire the human spirit through outstanding \nachievements in learning, discovery, and citizenship in a creative community, building one of the \nworld’s great universities for the public good. \nOur institutional strategic goals are to:  \n• BUILD a diverse, inclusive community of exceptional students, faculty, and staff from \nAlberta, Canada, and the world. \n• EXPERIENCE diverse and rewarding learning opportunities that inspire us, nurture our \ntalents, expand our knowledge and skills, and enable our success. \n• EXCEL as individuals, and together, sustain a culture that fosters and champions \ndistinction and distinctiveness in teaching, learning, research, and service. \n• ENGAGE communities across campuses, city and region, province, nation, and the \nworld to create reciprocal, mutually beneficial learning experiences, research projects, \npartnerships, and collaborations. \n• SUSTAIN our people, our work, and the environment by attracting and stewarding the \nresources we need to deliver excellence to the benefit of all. \nTo fulfill our plans, continued, mutually rewarding engagement with communities, public and \nprivate sector organizations, Indigenous nations and groups, industry, and all levels of \ngovernment is key. We will work them, and as partners, serve the province of Alberta and its \ncitizens in building prosperity and strengthening communities.  \nIn this report, we demonstrating that, in implementing and meeting our For the Public Good \ngoals, we also advance the Government of Alberta’s five objectives for our province’s integrated \nadult learning system: Accessibility, Affordability, Quality, Coordination, and Accountability. For \nexample, to build a diverse, inclusive community, the university and its faculties are developing \ntargeted recruitment strategies (increasing access), programs (broadening quality), financial \nsupports (ensuring affordability) and student services (improving coordination) dedicated to \nAlberta’s fast-growing Indigenous student population. We are coordinating and generating new \ninitiatives, curriculum, and partnerships with Indigenous peoples to respond and be accountable \nto the Calls to Action of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission.  \nThroughout the following 2016-2017 Annual Report, you will find many other examples of how \nthe progress we have made towards the fulfilling our For the Public Good goals and strategies \n 7 \nalso meet the government’s five adult learning system objectives. As this province’s oldest \nuniversity, we take seriously our role as anchor of Alberta’s integrated, diverse post-secondary \neducation sector. We stand among Canada’s top five premier research-intensive, medical-\ndoctoral universities. This quality—which is based on innovative teaching and learning and a \nbreadth of research excellence—means that Alberta’s students have affordable access to \neducational experiences that rival the best in the world and to researchers tackling some of \ngravest challenges faced by our local and global communities. \nAlbertans have this access because of the Government of Alberta’s steadfast support for post-\nsecondary education and the University of Alberta’s long record of excellence and \naccountability. The result of this historical partnership has been a highly educated workforce, on \nthe one hand, and highly developed economic sectors and industries, on the other. To ensure \nthat Alberta’s communities and citizens continue to prosper into the future, the University of \nAlberta and Government of Alberta must continue to work together to create the conditions \nneeded to forge new knowledge, impart 21st century skills, instill creative mindsets, spark new \nbusinesses and industries, and build community resilience.   \nTogether, we can and will propel Alberta to a place of unprecedented leadership, and in \ncommon cause, we will build a better province, a better Canada, and a better world. \nDavid H. Turpin, CM, PhD, LLD, FRSC \nPresident and Vice-Chancellor \n 8 \nOPERATIONAL OVERVIEW \nIn June 2016, the Board of Governors unanimously approved For the Public Good, as the \nUniversity of Alberta’s new institutional strategic plan. This approval followed the unanimous \nrecommendation of the plan from General Faculties Council after broad consultation. For the \nPublic Good articulates the University of Alberta’s long-term, multi-layered plan to guide overall \ndecision-making, and is structured around five broad strategic goals: Build, Experience, Excel, \nEngage, and Sustain. Because of the engagement of so many in the planning process, For the \nPublic Good reflects the ideas, insights, values and aspirations of our community as a whole. \nSome of the goals, objectives and strategies in For the Public Good can be implemented \nimmediately, as reflected in this annual report, and others will unfold over the course of the next \ndecade. For the Public Good envisions a number of targeted efforts that will position the \nuniversity to respond to transformative developments and trends that cut across the U of A’s \nmandate for teaching, research, and community engagement.  \nThe U of A remains committed to supporting accessibility for Alberta students. Through a range \ntargeted of recruitment activities, the university is reaching out widely to Alberta high school \nstudents, post-secondary transfer students from the Campus Alberta system, as well as \nIndigenous, rural, francophone and students. Accessibility for these groups, particularly under-\nrepresented student cohorts, is a key focus and is supported by the construction—underway—\nof over 800 new residence spaces on North Campus. Our national recruitment activities are \nfocuses on attracting high-achieving high school students from other provinces without reducing \naccess for qualified Albertans. \nThe university takes seriously its responsibility for providing supports that sustain the success of \nall of our students, regardless their circumstances. The profile of student mental health and \nthe challenges of proactively providing services to address mental health concerns are ever-\ngrowing, and the university continues to provide a robust system of mental health services. \nUnder For the Public Good, the University of Alberta takes seriously its responsibility to respond \nto the Calls to Action in the Truth and Reconciliation (TRC) report. The university has made \na commitment to develop, “a thoughtful, respectful, meaningful, and sustainable response to the \nreport.” The university has made considerable progress on this goal in the last year, building a \nfoundation of relationships with Indigenous communities and institutions and extending supports \nfor faculty, staff, and students. These wide-ranging commitments specifically respond to the \npost-secondary focused Calls to Action issued by the TRC and have positive, impactful \nimplications for faculties, for student services, and for front-line staff across the university, and \nwill remain a growing priority for years to come.  \nTeaching and learning is a rapidly evolving landscape, driven in significant ways by both student \nexpectation and by opportunities and demands to connect more efficiently with other institutions \nand communities locally, nationally, and internationally. In order to maintain its standing as \nworld-class institution, the University of Alberta continues to innovate in and beyond real and \nvirtual classrooms. Through a revamped Centre for Teaching and Learning, as well as an \nexciting range of experiential learning opportunities—co-ops, internships, community \nservice-learning, volunteerism, and more—the university is driving excellence in the student \nexperience. The U of A’s world-class leadership in Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) \n 9 \nand online programming, exemplified by the launch of the popular Mountains 101 and \nIndigenous Canada MOOCs this year, ensures that we remain at the cutting edge of digital \nlearning, also expanding access and reach to quality U of A teaching. \nThe landscape of research funding in Canada continues to evolve, with an increasing emphasis \non large-scale support for collaborative, multi-disciplinary research groups tackling major \nsocietal problems. While continuing to enable U of A researchers to excel across a wide range \nof fields and disciplines, the university is also maximizing its capacity to lead change by \nnurturing dynamic, multi- and inter-disciplinary teams that are able to take multi-faceted \napproaches to problems. This year we launched a process to define university-wide Signature \nAreas of multi-disciplinary global leadership in alignment with this goal.  \nThrough the Future Energy Systems initiative, the university has capitalized on its broad \nexpertise in energy and climate science, receiving $75 million under the Canada First Research \nExcellence Fund to lead and meet the global call to action to enable the transition to a lower-\ncarbon energy economy. The U of A’s globally-recognized leadership in machine learning and \nartificial intelligence  was also recognized under the $125 million Pan-Canadian Artificial \nIntelligence Strategy and both of these areas will constitute key focus areas in coming years.  \nA number of other emerging trends locally, nationally, and internationally present pressures for \nthe university’s operations. \nThe university continues to witness demand—both from students and from employers—for \nprofessional master’s degree programs and professional certifications, the creation of \nwhich is presently constrained by restrictions on revenue-generating programming. While the \nuniversity works to develop proposals that are sustainable and fruitful for the university and that \nare responsive to needed student programming, institutions from outside Alberta are actively \nsetting up these programs in the province and filling the identified need. The university remains \nhopeful that Advanced Education’s reviews of the tuition and funding models for post-secondary \ninstitutions will open the door for universities to embrace these opportunities.  \nEmerging shifts in the labour environment for academic staff in the post-secondary environment \nmay have transformative impacts going forward. The university is actively preparing for the \nimplementation of new labour legislation and comprehensive negotiations with the Association \nof Academic Staff University of Alberta (AASUA) are scheduled to begin in November 2017.  \nWhile direct impacts of the American election and Brexit have not yet been felt, it is worth noting \nthat the university anticipates the possibility of increased interest in the University of Alberta. As \nalready experienced by other Canadian institutions, American and British academics, and \nstudents, currently working or studying in the United States and United Kingdom may now be \nexploring other options.  \nThe university is cognizant of fiscal constraints in Alberta. While the continuing tuition freeze for \ndomestic students presents ongoing revenue challenges, the university has benefitted from \ncontinued provincial investment in the post-secondary sector. To ensure continuing fiscal \nsustainability, the university continues to seek efficiencies across its operations. Moreover, with \nfive well-established major campuses to support, the university has prioritized infrastructure \ninvestments to renew and optimize utilization of existing infrastructure. \nPublic sector institutions like the University of Alberta play a critical role in the economy from \nmany different perspectives. The university attracts hundreds of millions of dollars from outside \n 10 \nAlberta largely for research, creating high paying professional employment opportunities and \nsubsequent spin-off benefits to the Alberta economy. The university attracts thousands of \nstudents from around the world, further bolstering the economy and bringing highly-skilled \nindividuals to our province. As a world-leading research institution, the university supports \ndiversification of the economy. Finally, it is educating tens of thousands of students who will \ncreate further economic benefits and assist in economic diversification. Providing the necessary \nincreases to the Campus Alberta Grant is a sound investment as the University of Alberta \nfunctions as a critical buffer to the economy while other industries and sectors continue to adjust \nto the current economic environment. \nSummary Statistics \nTable 1.

This plan affirms our guiding ethos to “inspire the human spirit through outstanding \nachievements in learning, discovery, and citizenship in a creative community, building one of the \nworld’s great universities for the public good.” \nThis section reports on the initiatives and outcomes identified in the 2016 Comprehensive \nInstitutional Plan, re-organized according to the five top-level goals expressed in For the Public \nGood: to Build a diverse, inclusive community of exceptional students, faculty and staff from \nAlberta, Canada, and the world; to Experience diverse and rewarding learning opportunities \nthat inspire us, nurture our talents, expand our knowledge and skills, and enable our success; to \nExcel as individuals, and together, sustain a culture that fosters and champions distinction and \ndistinctiveness in teaching, learning, research, and service; to Engage communities across our \ncampuses, city and region, province, nation and the world to create reciprocal, mutually \nbeneficial learning experiences, research projects, partnerships, and collaborations; and to \nSustain our people, our work, and the environment by attracting and stewarding the resources \nwe need to deliver excellence to the benefit of all Albertans.  \nThese goals and initiatives directly support Alberta’s Adult Learning System Principles: ensuring \nthe accessibility of a wide range of programs and experiences to Albertans and top students \nfrom Canada and the world; maintaining the affordability of the U of A experience and the \nsustainability of our programming and infrastructure; delivering research and teaching that has \nglobal quality, relevance, and impact; promoting coordination within and beyond our walls, with \npartners in education, community, government, and industry; and embracing our accountability \nto government, to our community, and to a wide array of stakeholders within and beyond the \nacademy. \nThrough extensive consultation, the university has developed a set of performance indicators for \nreporting on For the Public Good. Some measures from the 2016 CIP have been replaced in \ncases where improved outcome measures are now available. Goals have been re-numbered for \nthis report.  \n 12 \nBuild \nGOAL: Build a diverse, inclusive community of exceptional students, faculty and \nstaff from Alberta, Canada, and the world    \nThrough the development of strategic recruitment, retention, and renewal plans, the University \nof Alberta is working to build a community of exceptional students, educators, scholars, \nresearchers, and staff from Alberta, Canada, and the world. We aim to foster an inclusive \nculture in which people excel through exchange and collaboration, enriched by the diversity of \nindividuals, groups, disciplines, perspectives, approaches, and questions that comprise our \ncommunity. We sustain this culture and community through rich educational and life \nexperiences in a supportive learning environment.  \n– For the Public Good \nThe University of Alberta is committed to accessibility for Albertans, Canadians, and citizens of \nthe world. As a Comprehensive Academic and Research Institution (CARI), the U of A plays a \ncritical role in the post-secondary system by providing access within Alberta to a full range of \nfoundational programs, specialized and professional programs, and graduate programs, along \nwith the diversity of experiences offered by a true multi-campus environment. The U of A is \nequally committed to affordability, which the university supports through extensive financial aid \nas well as by ensuring that students have access to programs within their home province. \nAccess is also supported by robust mental health supports and initiatives to prevent and \naddress sexual violence, detailed under Sustain. \nFinally, the university is committed to responding to the Calls to Action of the Truth and \nReconciliation Commission of Canada with concrete initiatives that contribute to closing the \neducational gap between Indigenous and non-Indigenous people and improving relationships \nwith Indigenous peoples and communities. Work is also presently underway in several faculties, \nvia curriculum development, to Indigenize the curriculum to educate students, and the broader \npublic, on the histories of the Indigenous peoples of Canada as well as the residential school \nlegacy itself. \n 13 \nGOALS AND PRIORITY INITIATIVES \nCIP Goal (G) or \nPriority Initiative (P) \nDescription Completion Adult \nLearning \nSystem \nPrinciple \nFor the \nPublic \nGood \nObjective \nG1 Increase the \nbreadth of locations \nfrom which U of A \nundergraduate students \nare drawn \nNearly half of the undergraduate students at the \nU of A currently list their hometown as Edmonton. \nIncrease geographical reach to bring a diverse \ngroup of Albertans, Canadians, and international \nstudents to the U of A to serve provincial labour \nmarket development \n2025 Accessibility Build 1 \nG2 Faculty Renewal  Renew the professoriate to improve the balance of \nranks and increase diversity. \n2025 Quality Build 2 \nG3 Increase \nrecruitment and \nretention of Indigenous \nstudents \nIncrease the number of Indigenous students to \nreflect their demographic representation in the \nAlberta population.

By ensuring the \navailability of a wide array of programs within the province, we support a diversity of career \naspirations and wider economic objectives. It is a priority to ensure that the U of A is accessible \nand that the wellness of our community is enhanced, recognizing that all students, and \nparticularly under-represented cohorts, are served by improved supports, communication, \nfacilities, and infrastructure. The university directly supports accessibility through a robust \nsystem of financial supports, administering approximately $90 million in scholarship and bursary \nfunding.  \nThe U of A’s five campuses [pull-out box] \n• North Campus, in the heart of Edmonton, is the hub of the U of A’s academic, research, \nand administrative functions, and is a bustling community of over 35,000 students and \n7,500 faculty and staff. \n• South Campus boasts some of the best agricultural research and teaching facilities in \nNorth America, as well as the Medical Isotope and Cyclotron Facility and two world-class \nathletic facilities, Foote Field and the Saville Community Sports Centre. \n• Enterprise Square is a vibrant hub in downtown Edmonton that fosters research, \nlearning, and partnership, and hosts the Faculty of Extension, TEC Edmonton, and \npublic gallery space.  \n• Augustana Campus, located in Camrose, Alberta, offers a liberal arts experience in a \nrural setting on the historic campus of the former Camrose Lutheran College. \n• Campus Saint-Jean is unique in western Canada: an interdisciplinary, French-language \ncampus offering a range of programs in science, arts, social sciences, education, and \nlanguage.  \nThe U of A also operates the University of Alberta Botanic Garden, a stunning 240-acre property \nlocated 15 minutes southwest of Edmonton. The garden is an award-winning visitor attraction, a \nresearch site, and home to year-round adult and children’s education programming.  \nIndigenous Enrolment \nThe University of Alberta endeavours to enrol Indigenous students at rates that are at least \nproportionate to the representation of Indigenous peoples in the Alberta population (6.2 per cent \naccording to the 2011 National Household Survey).  In addition to the recruitment of qualified \nIndigenous students, achieving this goal requires a multi-faceted approach that includes \nstewardship of community relationships, thoughtful and coordinated response to the \nrecommendations of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada, increasing the \nvisibility of Indigenous ceremony and symbols on our campuses to signal a welcoming \nenvironment, and removing systemic barriers to self-identification, participation, and student \nsuccess.  \nB\nU\nIL\nD\nO\nbj\n. 1\n 16 \nWork is underway in all of the above areas, and significant progress has been made in \nincreasing Indigenous enrolment. A total of 1,012 self-identified Indigenous undergraduate \nstudents are enrolled in 2016-17 – the largest number in the institution’s history. This number \nincreased by 9.6 per cent over the previous year. This increase can be attributed to both new \nIndigenous student registrations and larger numbers of students who are comfortable self-\nidentifying as First Nations, Metis, or Inuit. Indigenous undergraduate applicants, admitted \nstudents, and incoming registrants also increased significantly over the previous year, at 16, 17, \nand 23 per cent, respectively. \nIncluded among our 1012 Indigenous undergraduates are 80 new Indigenous learners making \nup the largest cohort in 14 years for our Transition Year Program -- an access program for \nIndigenous applicants who may not be prepared to enter a degree program through the regular \nadmissions route.  \nA new Aboriginal Student Support Fund (initial funding $50,000) supports persistence and \nstudent success by providing short-term emergency funding for those most in urgent need. \nNational Recruitment Strategy \nA new National Recruitment Strategy, launched in the fall of 2016, renews our commitment to \nthe active recruitment of Albertan students and also expands recruitment activities across the \ncountry. Encouraging a broad range of Albertan students to continue to study in their home \nprovince while also attracting top students from across Canada supports the creation of a \ndiverse and inclusive community of exceptional students. \nTarget prospective student groups under the National Recruitment Strategy include Alberta high \nschool students, high-achieving high school students from other provinces, post-secondary \ntransfer students from the Campus Alberta system, as well as Indigenous, rural, and \nfrancophone students. A series of fall 2016 University of Alberta events designed to engage \nprospective students, parents, and counsellors attracted over 28,000 Albertans and more than \n9,000 people from other provinces.  \nIncreased automation of the undergraduate admissions process for 2016-17 means that \ncurrently attending Canadian high school applicants are eligible to receive an offer of admission \nin as little as two to five days following receipt of necessary documents. \nProgramming innovations in 2016-17 \n• A refreshed Bachelor of Arts curriculum was approved through governance and will \nlaunch in 2018. The revised BA simplifies the common requirements, and emphasizes \nexperiential learning and learning pathways. \n• With the approval of the new Doctor of Pharmacy (PharmD) program, which will replace \nthe Bachelor of Science in Pharmacy (BScPharm) in fall of 2018, the U of A will become \nthe only university on the prairies to offer a post-baccalaureate PharmD, making the U of \nA a major destination of choice for pharmacy education in Canada.  \n• The U of A’s new Master of Accounting degree received the highest level of \naccreditation from the Chartered Professional Accountants of Alberta.  With this new \nstatus, the U of A is the only post-secondary institution in Western Canada to offer a \nmaster’s program allowing students to write their Certified Fraud Examiner professional \nexamination upon completion of the program. \n 17 \nAccess and Enrolment Trends \nUndergraduate enrolment is showing signs of overall health across a variety of dimensions, \nincluding application, admission, and registration rates, diversity, retention and completion. The \nUniversity of Alberta attracts a strong undergraduate applicant pool, both in terms of size and \ncompetitive admissibility, with students from over 140 countries. \nSeats are limited, and admission is competitive. While some of our high demand programs must \nturn away strong applicants due to lack of space, many of our programs remain accessible to a \nbroader range of applicants, either as direct-entry or post-secondary transfer students. \nIn 2016-17, Year 1 retention rates are at 88.6 per cent, having climbed steadily from 84.5 per \ncent in 2013-14. The trend for six-year undergraduate completion rates has been steady over \nthe past eight years, with rates between 67.4 per cent and 69.2 per cent. The rate for 2016-17 \n(2010-11 cohort year) is 67.9 per cent. \nA complete enrolment report is included in a separate section of the Annual Report – see page \n##. \nPerformance Measure (PM) 1: Composition of the student body \nProportion of Alberta Students from Outside of \nEdmonton \n2014-15 \n2015-16 \n2016-17 \nTarget \n2016-17 \nUndergraduate 31.8% 31.5% 31.3% 31% \nGraduate 34.5% 34.0% 35.5% N/A \nGrand Total 32.2% 31.8% 31.9%   \nSource: Acorn Data Warehouse, Student Headcount and FLE, as of April 3, 2017. \nNotes: Proportion based on students registered on December 1, of the reported year.

The university’s approach is guided by two pillars:  \nB\nU\nIL\nD\nO\nbj\n. 4\n 20 \n1. Building substantive relationships within the University of Alberta and with Indigenous \ncommunities and institutions in Treaty 6 Territory and beyond. As reconciliation \ninherently requires strong relationships, efforts in 2016-17 have largely focused on \ngetting to know the Indigenous community on and off campus to inform and guide our \nwork towards reconciliation. Over the past year, the university engaged community \nmembers to jointly develop an institutional territorial acknowledgement statement. \n2. Building internal and external capacity to undertake the work of truth-telling and \nreconciliation. This means hiring more Indigenous scholars, better supporting Indigenous \nstudents, and creating pathways for Indigenous students, faculty and staff to be \nincreasingly involved in all areas of our academic and research mission. In 2016-17, the \nuniversity launched an online portal of links to Alberta initiatives and activities related to \nIndigenous communities. \nThe U of A’s commitment to Indigenous communities is embodied across faculties and the \nresearch community. Other highlights:  \n• The Faculty of Arts opened an Aboriginal Gathering Space in the Humanities Centre. \nThe new space hosts programming for Indigenous students, including elder visits, \nworkshops and social events. \n• Faculty of Extension’s Dr. Fay Fletcher has just started working on a pilot mentorship \nprogram aimed at increasing the number of Indigenous knowledge keepers teaching \nIndigenous knowledge at post-secondary institutions. In this project, Indigenous Elders \nand knowledge keepers in Treaty 6 will mentor other Indigenous educators so that they \nare prepared to teach Indigenous Knowledge Systems (IKS) curriculum in identified topic \nareas. \n• On the off-site delivery front, the English Language School’s first collaboration with the \nNunavut government provided English language training to civil servants in Iqaluit.  In \nJanuary 2017, a group of civil servants attended two training modules with funding \nprovided by the Nunavut government. \n• The Inspiring Possibilities initiative was inaugurated in 2016 to imagine and promote \npathways for Indigenous students to enter graduate school. This year, three Inspiring \nPossibilities events have been held, bringing together U of A departments and faculties \nwith Indigenous students interested in attending graduate school.  \n• A series of Indigenous Community Engagement Research and Learning projects were \nlaunched at a community learning event in October 2016. Six research groups, including \nelders and community members, presented their ideas. The first products – videos and \nworkshops on respectful engagement with communities – have been produced and are \nbeing shared with members of the university community.  \nA Diverse and Inclusive University: Other Highlights \n• The university made a host of services available to those affected by the U.S. ban on \ntravel from specified countries, including travel support, counseling, and the waiver of \nsome application fees for affected students. \n- “Today, as president of the University of Alberta—but also as a citizen of Alberta \nand Canada—I want to voice our university’s firm commitment to diversity, \ninclusion, and equity in the face of rising isolationism and division. These values \nguide our actions every day in a myriad of small ways, but sometimes, we are \nhttps://www.ualberta.ca/aboriginal-indigenous\n 21 \ncalled to stand up for them in visible and vocal ways.” – President David Turpin, \nJan. 29, 2017 \n• This year, the President’s Award for Refugees and Displaced Persons Fund was made \navailable to cover the cost of tuition and living expenses for up to 10 undergraduate or \ngraduate Syrian students, admitted to the U of A as early as January 2016. \n• Dean of Law Paul Patton received the ‘Leaders in Diversity Award” from the Federation \nof Asian Canadian Lawyers - Western Chapter, recognizing individuals who have \ndemonstrated a commitment to fostering and promoting diversity in the legal profession. \nDean Paton has worked to transform the culture of Law, endeavoring to ensure that all \nstudents, staff and faculty are valued for their perspectives and experience, inside and \noutside the Faculty. \n• The Faculty of Education’s Jason Harley is developing a mobile augmented reality (AR) \napp to reinforce and extend the message “It gets better” to demonstrate the progress \nmade by sexual and gender minorities in Edmonton. This AR app will provide a real-\nworld environment view, in conjunction with Smart Boards and Google Earth, to allow \nstudents to visit points of interest without having to leave their classroom. \n 22 \nExperience \nGOAL: Experience diverse and rewarding learning opportunities that inspire us, \nnurture our talents, expand our knowledge and skills, and enable our success \nPushing beyond the conventional, students—no matter their background, age, or stage of \neducation—experience learning as an integral part of all their activities at the University of \nAlberta, where they have access to and participation in a broad range of curricular experiential \nlearning opportunities that are well integrated with program goals and enrich their academic \nexperience. The university endeavours to pay attention to the development of the whole person \nand to excel in providing learning environments that transform us, nurture our talents, expand \nour knowledge and skills, and enable our success. We aim to build innovative curricular and co-\ncurricular experiential learning programs that engage students, faculty, and staff with issues, \nquestions, and ideas relevant to community organizations, industry, and governments today, \nand which enable their self-discovery and give them the skills to use their talents, creativity, and \ncuriosity to contribute as future citizens and leaders. We seek and sustain student success. We \nmobilize the expertise of our faculty and expand access to educational experiences for \ncontinuing, professional, and lifelong learners. \n- For the Public Good \nKey priorities for 2016-17 included enhancing experiential learning opportunities for both \nundergraduate and graduate students, enriching their learning while ensuring that they are fully \nequipped to contribute to Alberta’s economy and society. These initiatives support the quality of \nundergraduate and graduate education as well as coordination with a valued set of community \npartners. \n 23 \nGOALS AND PRIORITY INITIATIVES \nCIP Goal (G)/ Priority \nInitiative (P) \nDescription Completion Adult \nLearning \nSystem \nPrinciple \nFor the \nPublic Good \nObjective \nG5 Enhance teaching \nand the focus on \nlearning outcomes \nPost-secondary teaching is undergoing a radical change \nthat will benefit learners.

Through co-ops, community service-learning, volunteerism, \ninternships, research experiences, and more, U of A students develop skills and contribute to \ncommunities across Alberta, Canada, and the world. \nCommunity Service-Learning (CSL) had 1178 students doing projects across 49 courses and \nin partnership with 154 community-based organizations in the Edmonton region. \nExperiential Learning around the University: Highlights \n• Located on the Faculty of Arts main page, +EXP is an online portal developed and \ndesigned to detail the comprehensive experiential learning opportunities available to all \nstudents. \n• Through the Arts Work Experience (AWE) program, more than half of Arts \nundergraduate programs received official co-op accreditation through the Canadian \nAssociation for Co-operative Education. \n• The unique Leadership Certificate Program in the Alberta School of Business offers \nBComm students a chance to experience mentorship by extraordinary leaders from all \nwalks of life, building networks that will serve our students throughout their careers.  \n• Engage North, a University of Alberta organization spearheaded by professors in \nEngineering, sends interns into northern communities to work on community-driven \nprojects. Seven internships were available this year. \n• The Nursing Simulation Centre is 1,307 square metres of state-of-the-art space where \nFaculty of Nursing undergraduate and graduate students engage in immersive learning \nusing a variety of simulated teaching-learning strategies. This realistic environment of \nthe Nursing Simulation Centre supports applied learning in a safe environment and \nprovides learning experiences that are high-risk or may be difficult to obtain in the clinical \nsetting (e.g. cardiac arrest or birthing of a baby). \n• The new Doctor of Pharmacy (PharmD) program, approved this year, will see \nexperiential education in the Faculty of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences \nexpanded to a total of 40 weeks, opening up new opportunities for experiential rotations. \n• Students from the Faculties of Science and Engineering developed the first ever made-\nin-Alberta satellite, launched from Cape Canaveral on April 18, 2017.

The U of A continues to build and \nsupport collaborative research capacity to produce leading-edge research on critical issues that \nconfront humanity, while advancing the foundational research that will enable transformative \ninnovation. Bringing together areas of identified research strength that contribute to \ninterdisciplinary, multidisciplinary, and cross-disciplinary projects and approaches, collaborative \nresearch tackles the many urgent social, technological, and economic problems that society \nfaces now and in future.  \nOver the last decade, U of A researchers have attracted total sponsored research funding in \nexcess of $4.6 billion, putting the U of A fourth among Canada’s research-intensive universities. \nOn an annual basis, sponsored research funding has averaged more than $400 million per year, \nwith a peak value of $536 million in 2010–11. TEC Edmonton ensures that U of A research \nsolutions have the greatest impact on society and the economy through commercialization. \nWorking closely with U of A researchers, TEC Edmonton has created 27 new spin-off \ncompanies, 901 patent applications, 91 license agreements and over $5.2 million in licensing \nrevenues since 2010. \nPast provincial investment has ensured that the University of Alberta has been able to build \nprominent international collaborations, make significant contributions to areas of fundamental \nimportance to Albertans (including energy and the environment, health, and economic \ndiversification), and to recruit and train the innovative leaders of tomorrow. The U of A will \ncontinue to leverage provincial funding to attract greater external investment from the public and \nprivate sector, including participation in prominent federal funding programs such as the Canada \nFirst Research Excellence Fund (CFREF), which this year funded the Future Energy Systems \ninitiative for $75 million, and foster long-term cycles of significant re-investment in Alberta.  \nResearch Outcomes \nThe university’s broad portfolio of foundational and applied research supports Alberta’s research \noutcomes: a strong economy, effective resource management, environmental stewardship, and \na focus on supporting the health of Albertans in all our communities. \nA strong economy: highlights \n• Construction on a $25-million dollar production plant will begin construction in the fall to \npave the way for the commercialization of next generation renewable fuels renewable \ndiesel made from waste fat – a process that was developed at the University of Alberta \n12 years ago by bioresource scientist David Bressler, director of the Biorefining \nE\nX\nC\nEL\nO\nbj\n. 1\n1,\n 1\n3 \n 30 \nConversions Network in the Faculty of Agricultural, Life and Environmental Sciences. \nOnce built, the plant will produce renewable liquid hydrocarbons at a capacity of 19 \nmillion litres annually—providing a vital source of green fuels. \n• Researchers Jonathan Curtis, Thava Vasanthan, David Bressler, and Allan Schaefer \nwere recognized at Innovation Makes Sense, an annual TEC Edmonton event to honour \nU of A researchers who in the past year successfully received patents or were \ninstrumental in spin-off companies from their research. These achievements played a \nsignificant role in helping the U of A achieve its ranking this past year among the top 100 \nuniversities in the world for U.S. patents this past year. \nArtificial Intelligence and Machine Learning at the U of A [pull-out box] \nThe U of A is among the world leaders in artificial intelligence and machine learning \ntechnologies, and is one of three centres – along with Toronto-Waterloo and Montreal – for the \nfederal government’s $125-million Pan-Canadian Artificial Intelligence Strategy, announced in \nBudget 2017.  \nBy 2025, artificial intelligence and machine-learning technologies — and the products and \nbusinesses they will spark — are predicted to generate at least $50 trillion in global economic \ngrowth. Today, the U of A ranks second in the world for artificial intelligence, machine learning, \nand data mining, and its Alberta Machine Intelligence Institute, or Amii (formerly Alberta \nInnovates Centre for Machine Learning) is Canada’s leading centre in the field of machine \nintelligence. AI and machine learning research at the U of A have wide-reaching applications – \nincluding prosthetics that improve the quality of life for amputees, and predictive medicine that \ncould help doctors prevent cancer, Alzheimer’s and diabetes before they start. With these \napplications and many others, including self-driving cars, artificial intelligence is transforming \nmany facets of society.  \nA key component of the Pan-Canadian Artificial Intelligence Strategy is to foster the \ncommercialization of AI-driven start-ups and work closely with industry to improve their \noperations. Some of the recent industry collaborations at the University of Alberta include \nresearch partnerships with large companies like RBC, and project-based ones, such as \noptimizing water treatment control systems with Edmonton-based ISL Engineering. \nEffective resource management: highlights \nThe University of Alberta this year launched Future Energy Systems (FES), a major initiative \naimed at reducing the environmental footprint of fossil fuels and developing new low-carbon \nenergy systems, thanks to a $75-million federal grant under the Canada First Research \nExcellence Fund. Directed by Larry Kostiuk, Future Energy Systems brings together \nresearchers across disciplines to improve energy systems related to unconventional \nhydrocarbon resources—tailings ponds, greenhouse emissions, water use, land reclamation, \nand safe, efficient energy transportation. The initiative, which will fund collaborative projects \nacross the university and beyond, builds on U of A strengths in advanced materials, smart \nelectrical grids and bioprocessing to help move Canada to a low-carbon energy economy. FES \npositions the U of A as a major national and international leader in this area.  \nEnvironmental stewardship: highlights \n• The province’s fields of waving prairie grasses, stretching from the parkland surrounding \nEdmonton all the way to the Montana border and into Saskatchewan and Manitoba, play \n 31 \na valuable role in storing carbon. These ecosystems are also among Canada’s most \nendangered. U of A researchers are working through organizations like the university’s \nRangeland Research Institute and using key resources such as the Roy Berg Kinsella \nResearch Ranch and Mattheis Research Ranch to raise awareness and inform policy-\nmakers and ranchers alike of the need to ramp up conservation efforts for Alberta’s \nremaining grasslands. Two more research ranches in southern Alberta were recently \nadded to the university’s roster, adding further scientific capacity. Work being funded by \nbeef producers is also underway at the U of A to help balance cattle grazing with \nsustainable use of ecologically sensitive pastureland. \n• The U of A received a $2.6 million grant from the Natural Sciences and Research \nCouncil (NSERC) to fund projects including one that will look at the risks lodgepole pine \nand white spruce face due to the warming of their environment caused by climate \nchange. It will determine how far north and how much higher in elevation the forestry \nindustry can move those tree populations to help them thrive – important for ensuring \nthat future reforestation efforts respond to climate change. \n• Scott Nielsen, a conservation scientist in the Department of Renewable Resources, has \nteamed up with colleagues from across western Canada to create the Grizzly-PAW \nproject: Grizzly Population Assessment in Yellowhead. The Yellowhead ecosystem is \nthe area around Hinton, Alberta, in the foothills east of Jasper National Park. The plan is \nto develop new tools to manage the endangered population in a way that helps speed \nrecovery, and this requires partnerships with government and industry. The Natural \nSciences and Engineering Research Council (NSERC) recently provided $1.4 million in \nfunding to the group.  \nSupporting the health of Albertans in all our communities: highlights \n• The Alberta SPOR Support Units (AbSPORU) have invested $48 million in support \nplatforms to facilitate patient-oriented clinical health research in Alberta; platforms led by \nUniversity of Alberta faculty including data, research services, knowledge translation, \npragmatic trials, and career services are transforming access to health data and \ncreating, training opportunities. Most importantly, patients now have an active voice in \nresearch. \n• The Strategic Clinical Networks (SCNs), Alberta Health Services, which represent \nintegrated teams across 16 focused areas of health care, form a vehicle of innovation on \na population scale. Collaborations between our faculty and the SCNs have facilitated the \ntranslation of innovative health research into practice. \n• Following the Fort McMurray fires in 2016, researchers in the Faculty of Medicine and \nDentistry (FoMD) began looking at its effects on the health and well-being of those that \nwere evacuated. This has resulted in four new major grant-funded projects – funded by \nthe provincial and federal governments and the Red Cross - that will be looking at the \nhealth effects on the firefighters, environmental contaminants that will affect traditional \nfood use of Aboriginal communities, the impact on pregnant women and neonatal health, \nand how the forced evacuation has affected the mental health of children and \nadolescents. \n• Multi-year data on farm safety collected by the School of Public Health’s Injury \nPrevention Centre (IPC) made key contributions to the passage of Bill 6, the Enhanced \nProtection for Farm and Ranch Workers Act. \n 32 \nInternational Institutional Partnerships \nTable #.

Classes attend a week-long, immersive educational experience on \ncampus that is grounded in the Alberta curriculum.  These classes come from socially vulnerable \nurban, Indigenous and rural communities, groups that tend to have lower post-secondary \nengagement. In 2016-17, U School hosted nearly 750 students from across Alberta, reaching north \nto Fort McKay and south the Montana First Nation (near Ponoka).  Today, the program is seeing its \nfirst alumni attend the U of A. \nWhat’s Up at the U? \nThe What’s Up at the U? program engages high school students through presentations delivered by \ngraduate students about their research and the unique programs available in their chosen \ndisciplines. In 2016-17, the U of A visited four schools and engaged over 200 students. They learned \ntopics as varied as neuroplasticity, historical languages, the rhetoric of guns and politics, the impact \nof social media and the philosophy of education in  Muslim culture. Teachers report the parents have \nsaid their children are more driven to learn and are particularly inquisitive following the U of A’s \nvisits.  \nCamps and summer programs: \n• Calgary Public Library and the U of A collaborated on a dino camp for six to 10 year olds with \nno access to summer programming. A grad student in Paleontology provided lessons on \ndinosaurs, brought fossils and dinosaur bones (copies) and had the kids simulate a \npaleontology dig. She visited 12 branches over five days and engaged approximately 300 \nchildren.  \nE\nN\nG\nAG\nE \nO\nbj\n. 1\n6 \n   43 \nA N N U A L  RE POR T  -  DR A FT \n• The Faculty of Engineering’s STEM-based DiscoverE programs \n(http://discovere.ualberta.ca/AboutDiscoverE.aspx) deliver high-impact classroom \nworkshops, unique clubs and events, and engaging summer camps to more than 27,000 \nyouth every year, and reached over 80 communities across northern Alberta and the \nNorthwest Territories. \n• The Faculty of Engineering ran more than 25 Aboriginal youth camps this year, reaching \n3920 Indigenous students. \n• The Faculty of Science offered a diverse range of summer camps for students in grades 1-\n12.

In \naddition to the summer camps, the Faculty of Science hosted over 4,500 people on campus \nthrough public lectures and science events like Science Fun-day \n• The Faculty of Education held a Young Indigenous Women’s Circle of Leadership (YIWCL) \nday camp with the goal of creating a cultural blueprint for young Indigenous people so they \ncan connect with their culture and know they have a place at post-secondary institutions. \nOther youth engagement highlights: \n• Dr Ania Ulrich is engaged with St. Joseph’s High School Indigenous Leadership Academy \nand Alexis Nakota Sioux Nation focused on mentoring the next generation of Indigenous \nscience, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) leaders. \n• Augustana hosted the Battle River School Division Science Fair in February 2017, which \nincluded community involvement from Camrose city councillors, local business leaders and \nalumni who assisted in judging the competition. \nEngaging Alumni and Donors \nAlumni: \nThe University of Alberta actively showcases the positive impacts of its alumni community. The \nAlumni Association promotes lifelong learning and profiles outstanding U of A research to the alumni \ncommunity.  In the past year, 53 U of A academic guest speakers were featured at alumni events in \nEdmonton and at regional events worldwide. In total, 356 alumni guest speakers participated in a \nvariety of engagement opportunities, including lifestyle programs on parenting and budgeting, \nstudent recruitment and mentoring sessions, and career forums for students.  \nDonors: \nDonors are an important example of community support for the university, and key to the U of A’s \nfinancial sustainability. The university recognizes their support through appreciation events, stories \ntold during Changing Lives Week, February 27-March 3, and an annual report to endowment donors \non the impact of their donations.  \nThe university honoured the historic $40 million gift of the Stollery Children’s Hospital Foundation \nand $14.5 million from the Royal Alexandra Hospital Foundation to the Women and Children’s \nHealth Research Institute with a special ceremony and media announcement. \nE\nN\nG\nAG\nE \nO\nbj\n. 1\n6 \nhttp://discovere.ualberta.ca/AboutDiscoverE.aspx\n   44 \nA N N U A L  RE POR T  -  DR A FT \nBuilding and Sustaining Engagement through the Multi-\nCampus Environment \nThe U of A continues to strengthen its relationships with neighbouring communities. Through various \nneighbourhood committees, the university is in constant dialogue to share updates, concerns and \nopportunities about campus life and campus lands that may have impact on the larger community \nthat we share. This is largely achieved by the U of A meeting on a regular basis to advance dialogue \non how we live as one community.  \nThe U of A’s multi-campus environment provides access to unique opportunities and infrastructure \nfor our surrounding communities and the public at large.  \nEnterprise Square: \n• In 2016, the university welcomed new tenants to Enterprise Square. The Edmonton Public \nLibrary (EPL) Stanley A. Milner branch moved to the main floor of Enterprise Square (ESQ) \nin January 2016. They will be resident at ESQ for the three-year duration of their extensive \nrenovations to their original location. Both partners share core values in learning, literacy, \nand community engagement - making the U of A and EPL natural partners. Over the course \nof their tenancy, it is anticipated that the U of A and EPL will further deepen existing \nconnections and spur further thought-provoking lectures and unique programs to engage \nlearners of all ages.  \n• TEC Innovation District, TEC Edmonton’s newly renovated ground-floor space in Enterprise \nSquare, gives Edmonton’s technology entrepreneurs another point of entry to access \nmentorship and coaching from an in-house team of entrepreneurs and experts. More than a \ncommunity workspace, TEC Innovation District operates on an “entrepreneurs for \nentrepreneurs” philosophy, where business owners learn directly from others who have built \nsuccessful companies. Participating companies receive personalized mentorship, 24-hour \nuse of the downtown workspace, and access to TEC Edmonton’s regular event programming \nas well as its network of partner companies. \nAugustana Campus: \n• On March 1, 2017, Augustana hosted its annual Community Awards Banquet, which brings \nsupporters together with the students who benefit from their generosity. The Community \nAwards Program was established in 1973 with a purpose that continues today: to assist in \nmaking post-secondary studies accessible for students and give them an opportunity, that \nthey might not have had otherwise, to study at Augustana. This year, the Community Awards \nProgram supported 183 students with over $260,000 in donor-funded awards, scholarships, \nand bursaries. \n• For the second year in a row, Augustana hosted over 200 grade seven students from two \nlocal schools for a Science Fair on campus.  \nCampus Saint-Jean: \n• The Campus Saint-Jean Gala (le Gala Saint-Jean) is an opportunity to gather students who \nhave achieved one or more bursaries with community recipients of the Saint-Jean \nRecognition Awards.

Led by the Office of the Dean of Students, the university in 2016-17offered a range of \nmental health and sexual assault supports. While centered on students, these benefit the entire U of \nA community. \nThis year also saw an extended consultation process to develop a Healthy University Strategic Plan, \nwhich is intended to provide a comprehensive approach to supporting health and wellness over the \ncoming years. \nMental health activities and supports: \nThe U of A offers a robust system of mental health supports, including triage and treatment through \nCounselling and Clinical Services, health promotion activities led by a Community Social Work \nTeam, and a range of crisis intervention supports.  \nThe 2016-17 year saw increased uptake of existing services, and the university made concerted \nefforts to enhance policies and programs that support mental health promotion and early \ninterventions. The aim is to decrease the need for crisis services by supporting early access to \nsupports. Progress in 2016-17 includes: \n• Finalization of the University of Alberta Healthy Campus Policy  \n• 5,457 direct treatment hours provided to students at Counselling and Clinical Services \n(CCS), as of February 1, 2017 \n• 184 clinical group therapy session hours provided to students \n• 590 outreach hours provided to faculty and staff in support of student mental health \n• Participation of 1,310 students and 191 faculty/staff in health promotion learnings or activities \nled by the Community Social Work Team (CSWT) (as of February 1, 2017) \n• 1,841 attendees at 12 CSWT workshops and 4,554 attendees at 26 CSWT events (e.g. Days \nof Action) \n• 637 students attending 10 UniTea Peer Listening sessions  \n• Coordination of Campus Alberta mental health assessment activities. \nActivities and supports to address sexual violence \nAddressing sexual violence through prevention and survivor supports is a high priority for the U of A. \nThe university continued efforts to coordinate sexual violence supports across the community. Key \nhighlights include: \n• Approval of a sexual violence policy for the entire U of A community. \n• Initiation of a Sexual Assault Response Implementation Committee (SARIC), which oversees \nprogress on the recommendations made in the ‘Review of the University of Alberta’s \nResponse to Sexual Assault’ released in February 2016. All 46 of the recommendations are \ncurrently either addressed or in progress. \nOn an ongoing basis, the Sexual Assault Centre (SAC) offers crisis intervention programming (208 \nstudents, faculty, and staff supported in 2016-17), psychological support programs (368 hours of \nsupport in 2016-17), and anti-sexual violence and consent-based education (reaching 5172 students \nand 115 faculty and staff this year).

That’s just one of several goals in the \nuniversity’s new sustainability plan, which promotes goals big and small, from mitigating climate \nchange to phasing out polystyrene dishware from food vendors on campus. \nThe plan, released last December, will guide university-wide sustainability initiatives through 2020. It \nincludes dozens of new initiatives covering all aspects of university life, including work on waste \nmanagement systems and making buildings more sustainable. One of the plan’s most significant \nobjectives is to reduce the university’s greenhouse gas emissions to 17 per cent below 2005 levels \nby 2020, in line with Canada’s pledge under the 2009 Copenhagen Accord. \nIn the last year, the U of A was recognized with a TOBY Outstanding Building of the Year award for \nthe retrofit of Triffo Hall, and was named one of Canada’s Greenest Employers for the eighth \nconsecutive year. \nEnergy Management and District Energy \nThe university’s Energy Management Program, in operation for over 35 years, implements energy \nefficiency and conservation measures across campus. The Energy Management Program saves the \nuniversity over $15 million in energy-related costs per year.  \nA District Energy System centralizes the production of heating, cooling and electricity for a \nneighbourhood or community. In general it is more efficient than having separate systems in each \nbuilding, because it uses less fuel and reduces maintenance, transportation and distribution costs. \nThe University of Alberta owns and operates the fifth largest District Energy System in North \nAmerica. It uses natural gas for fuel which burns with fewer emissions than a traditional coal fired \nplant. The heating plant, in which the gas is burned, uses cogeneration technology to capture the \nheat that is emitted as a by-product of electrical generation. This heat, which would otherwise be \nlost, is reused to heat campus buildings. \nSustainability Enhancement Fund \nThe Sustainability Enhancement Fund (SEF) is a granting program that encourages and supports \ncollaborative projects that improve the university’s operational performance, foster campus \nengagement, and demonstrate the viability of best practices and technologies. The funds originate \nfrom the savings generated from energy efficient projects from the University of Alberta’s Energy \nManagement Program. Since 2011, the SEF contributed to four projects, totaling $107, 579. One of \nthese was the EcoCar: a cutting-edge, zero emission, and sustainability-focused vehicle that was \ndesigned by U of A students! In the summer of 2016, the EcoCar competed in Shell’s “Driver’s World \nChampionship” in London, a speed- and efficiency- competition with qualifying teams from around \nthe world. \nS\nU\nST\nAI\nN\nO\nbj\n. 2\n0 \n   53 \nA N N U A L  RE POR T  -  DR A FT \nSustaining our Infrastructure \nEnsure that the University of Alberta’s campuses, facilities, utility, and information technology \ninfrastructure can continue to meet the needs and strategic goals of the university – For the \nPublic Good \nThe university’s Capital Plan prioritizes the renewal, repurposing, and optimal use of existing assets \nto meet future needs.

These experiences equip students with the necessary \nknowledge and skills to be successful in an increasingly global environment. Our student-centered \ninitiatives, which promote global engagement, include:  \n● Enhanced experiential, internship, and co-op experiences in international settings (including \nthe e3 program in Berlin, Brazil, France, and Washington, as well as other educational and \nresearch abroad programs in more than 60 countries)  \n● The Certificate in International Learning (CIL), an embedded undergraduate certificate \ndocumenting students participation and achievement in international learning  \n○ In 2015-16, 52 students from five faculties graduated with the Certificate and currently \nthere are 261 students from all undergraduate faculties (except Medicine and \nDentistry) enrolled and working to complete certificate requirements. \n● The Canadian Learning Initiative in China (CLIC), which connects Canadian students with \nfully-funded study abroad opportunities in China  \n○ U of A had 37 students participate in 2016, with 67 students registered for 2017.  \n● Increased opportunities for U of A students to participate in shorter-duration international \nexperiences, either as an integral component of academic courses or independently \n(including the Alternative Reading Week program in the Faculty of Agricultural, Life and \nEnvironmental Sciences)  \n● Multiple formal joint and double degree programs with partner institutions from around the \nworld  \nResearch  \nThe university is a research-intensive institution with output that is recognized globally in diverse \ndisciplines. Through active, collaborative research with teams from all over the world, professors \nadvance knowledge, education, and pedagogy in their respective disciplines. Global research \nengagement has many benefits for the U of A and the province, including leveraging funding \nresources and expertise from other parts of the globe to address challenges that affect everyone, \nincluding Albertans. The U of A continues to engage in high-quality, multidisciplinary, multinational \nresearch projects in many parts of the globe, including:  \n● strengthening existing strategic international partnerships with India, China, Germany, the \nUnited States, Mexico, and Brazil  \n● fostering new, multidisciplinary, multinational research projects in diverse disciplines with \npartner institutions from other countries  \n● leveraging international funding agencies to secure resources to tackle emerging problems in \nregions of interest  \n   56 \nA N N U A L  RE POR T  -  DR A FT \nDiversity \nThe presence of international students and foreign-trained experts broadens the perspective, \nimpact, and relevance of the U of A’s teaching, research, creative activities, and community service \nwork. International students who are educated at the U of A and remain in Alberta provide the \nprovince with additional highly skilled, innovative, and entrepreneurial professionals. They also bring \ncultural diversity together with global connections, insights, and alternative perspectives on issues \nand challenges that better position the university, businesses, and the province. Recruitment of \nexceptional undergraduate and graduate students from targeted highly ranked foreign institutions \nadvances the university’s academic enterprise and objectives. In 2016-17, approximately 14 per \ncent of our undergraduate population and 34 per cent of our graduate population were international \nstudents. \nOffshore Program Delivery \nThe following table reports core metrics for offshore program delivery, per the provincial Guidelines \nfor Off-Shore Delivery of Alberta Post-Secondary Programs and Training. \nThough this table includes all credential programs offered outside of Canada and joint/dual degree \nprograms with students currently registered, it underrepresents the full scope of the university’s \ninternational educational activities. First, it does not include stand-alone courses or international co-\nop and experiential components of domestic programs. Second, it does not fully reflect joint degree \nprograms. In certain joint degree programs, students based at a foreign home university may spend \ntime at the U of A as visiting students during the course of their program, often working with a U of A \nfaculty mentor, but may petition for joint degree status only as they prepare to graduate. These \nstudents are not captured in the program enrolment data reported below. \n   57 \nA N N U A L  RE POR T  -  DR A FT \nInternational Shared Credentials (Dual/Joint Degree) Programs  \nUAlberta \nFaculty \nCountry Field of \nStudy \nCourses \nOffered \n(i.e., \nUAlberta \ncourses \noffered \nabroad) \nLevel of \nStudy \nQualificati\non \nOffered \n(full or \npartial) \nType of \noperation \nand \nprincipal \nmode of \ndelivery  \nInstitution Number \nof \nStudents \nfor \n2016/17* \n(UA \nstudents \nabroad) \nNumber \nof \nstudents \nfor \n2016/17* \n(UA \nstudents in \nprograms \nat UA) \nNumber \nof \nstudents \nfor \n2016/17* \n(students \nfrom \nabroad \ncurrently at \nUA for \nprogram) \nType of \nactivity \n(courses, \nresearch, \nor \npossibilit\ny of both) \nOther \nnotes \nAlberta \nSchool of \nBusiness \nFrance Business N/A Master’s MBA from U \nof A and \nMSc from \nEDHEC \nDual \ndegree; in \nperson \nEDHEC \nBusiness \nSchool \n0 0 6 (5 were \nlast \nregistered in \nSpring \n2016) \ncourses  \nAlberta \nSchool of \nBusiness \nJapan Business N/A Master’s MBA from \neach \ninstitution \nDual \ndegree; in \nperson \nNagoya \nUniversity of \nCommerce \nand \nBusiness \n(NUCB) \n0 0 0 courses  \nALES Germany, \nUK, \nFinland \nForestry, \nForest \nConservatio\nn, \nEnvironmen\ntal Science, \nConservatio\nn Biology \nN/A Master’s MSc or \nMaster of \nForestry \nfrom U of A; \ndegrees \nfrom other \ninstitutions \nvary \nDual \ndegree; in \nperson \nAlbert-\nLudwigs-\nUniversity \n(Freiburg) \n4 1 2 both \ncourses and \nresearch \nMaster’s \nprograms \nleading to \ndual \ndegrees in \nForestry \nand \nEnvironmen\ntal \nManagemen\nt \n(TRANSFO\nRM-M). \nStudents \nspend one \nyear in \nEurope, one \nyear at \nUAlberta. \n Bangor \nUniversity \n(Wales);  \n1 0 0 \n University of \nEastern \nFinland \n0 1 0 \n   58 \nA N N U A L  RE POR T  -  DR A FT \nFaculty of \nArts \nGermany Arts N/A \nDoctoral PhD from \nhome \ninstitution \nwith \nnotation on \nparchment \nJoint \ndegree; in \nperson \nLudwig-\nMaximilians-\nUniversitat \nMunchen \n(LMU) \n1 1 0 both \ncourses and \nresearch \nFaculty of \nEducation \nEducation 0 0 0 both \ncourses and \nresearch \nFaculty of \nScience \nScience 0 0 0 research  \nFaculty of \nEducation \nSouth \nKorea \nEducation N/A Master’s or \ndoctoral \nMA/MSc/ME\nd or \nPhD/EdD \nfrom both \ninstitutions \nwith \nparchments \nnoting the \nnames of \nboth \ninstitutions \nDual \ndegree; in \nperson \nSeoul \nNational \nUniversity \n0 0 2 both \ncourses and \nresearch \nFaculty of \nEngineering \nFrance Engineering N/A Master’s MSc from \nUAlberta \nand Dipl. of \nIng. degree \nfrom INPL \nDual \ndegree; in \nperson \nUniversity of \nLorraine \n0 (non-\nreciprocal) \n0 9 both \ncourses and \nresearch \nAgreement \nfor incoming \nstudents \nonly \nFaculty of \nPharmacy \nand \nPharmaceut\nical \nSciences \nBrazil Pharmacy N/A Master’s or \ndoctoral \nMSc or PhD \nfrom each \ninstitution \nDual \ndegree; in \nperson \nUniversidad\ne de Sao \nPaulo (USP) \n1 0 1 research  \nFaculty of \nScience \nMalaysia Science N/A Doctoral PhD from \neach \ninstitution \nDual \ndegree; in \nperson \nUniversiti \nPutra \nMalaysia \n(UPM)  \n0 0 1 research  \nSource: Faculty of Graduate Studies and Research and University of Alberta International  \nNotes: Year is calculated starting from the spring term (i.e. 2016/17 includes Spring, Summer, Fall 2016 and Winter 2017) \nIn addition to the programs listed in this table, the university offers the following programs that have no students currently enrolled:  \n● Dual degree Bachelor of Arts, offered in partnership with Ritsumeikan University (Japan), course-based, delivered in person  \n● Dual degree MBA from U of A and MBA or MSC from WHU – Otto Beisheim School of Management (Germany), course-based, delivered in person  \n● Dual degree PhD from U of A and Universidade Estadual de Campinas (Unicamp) (Brazil), research-based, delivered in person \n   59 \nA N N U A L  RE POR T  -  DR A FT \nUniversity of Alberta Programs delivered offshore  \nMASTER OF FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT PROGRAM (ALBERTA SCHOOL OF BUSINESS)  \n1.

While investments across \nEdmonton’s North and South campuses most immediately come to mind, investments in Augustana \nand Campus Saint-Jean have been key to maintaining and developing programming for rural liberal \narts and sciences as well as the only fully bilingual post-secondary campus in Western Canada. \nThe functional, operational, and environmental realities of the university’s older facilities are that they \nare simply incapable of meeting the needs of today’s students or faculty members. Combining \nfunctional and physical renewal projects provides a best-value model for capital projects, minimizing \nthe need for new buildings, while facilitating the needs of today’s learners and researchers, all at a \nsignificantly reduced capital cost. \nOur priorities shifting to reclaiming space resulted in improved program outcomes for many faculties \nwhile curtailing the requirements for new builds. Additionally, the requirement for leased space will \ndecrease diverting fewer resources away from learning and research. \nIn 2016-17, the university’s infrastructure objectives were to: \n• Support the academic and research goals while maximizing use and life of existing \ninfrastructure by ensuring that space is functional for current and future learning and \nresearch. \n• Maximize opportunities to identify and proactively address deferred maintenance and \nfunctional renewal with a specific focus on energy and carbon footprint reductions. \n• Ensure stable, long-term funding for deferred maintenance. \n• Maintain the reliability of the university’s utility plant through focused investment to address \ndeferred maintenance and increased efficiency with new technology. \n• Reduce the risk of building system failures that could affect life safety or result in building \nclosures. \n• Maintain and improve the condition through renewal and repurpose to improve the \nfunctionality of the university’s physical assets, which are critical in attracting, supporting, and \nretaining the best students, researchers, and faculty. \nHighlights in 2016-17: \n• Successfully partnered with the two levels of government involved in the Post-secondary \nStrategic Investment Fund (SIF) program to undertake ten projects with a combined value of \n$131.9 million directly impacting renewal and repurposing of existing facilities to address \nteaching and research priorities. \n• Successfully completed the Canadian Ice Core Archive resulting in the transfer of 12 ice \ncores from the Geological Survey of Canada’s Ice Core Research Laboratory to the \nuniversity. \n   62 \nA N N U A L  RE POR T  -  DR A FT \n• Successfully obtained national recognition through the Building Owners and Managers \nAssociation (BOMA) for facilities operation with the Edmonton Clinic Health Academy being \nrecognized regionally and Triffo Hall recognized nationally. \n• Completed the final phase of the University Hall renewal extending its life and reducing its \ndeferred maintenance to zero. \n• Via the university’s District Energy System, provided substantial savings in utility costs, not \nonly to the university, but also other taxpayer-funded institutions such as the Walter C. \nMackenzie Health Sciences Centre (University of Alberta Hospital, Stollery Children’s \nHospital, and Mazankowski Heart Institute); the Cross Cancer Institute, Canadian Blood \nServices, and the Jubilee Auditorium.  Over the past five years, the university’s average \npurchase prices for natural gas and power have been the lowest among the major post-\nsecondary institutions in Alberta, averaging 18 percent less for natural gas and 16 percent \nless for electricity. These savings, while still significant, continue to drop due to relatively \nweak market prices for these commodities. \n• Continued to support, via the District Energy Plan, the replacement of aging infrastructure \nand adoption of new technology. \n• The university’s Energy Management Plan is not only financed through borrowing and repaid \nthrough resulting energy savings, but also resulted in significant reductions in greenhouse \ngas emissions. \n• Revised the renewal project for the Cameron Library, which now includes defined energy \nsavings, green construction initiatives, and partnering with student groups for research. \n• Conducted extensive building investigation and design reviews in support of the recently \nannounced complete renovation of the Dentistry-Pharmacy building.  \nCapital Plan \nThe University of Alberta’s highest priority projects are strategically linked to the 2016 \nComprehensive Institutional Plan (CIP) goals and aligned with the Government’s adult learning \nsystem’s principles of accessibility, affordability, quality, coordination, and accountability. \nThe university has maintained its focus on that of addressing deferred maintenance and functional \nrenewal / repurposing of existing physical assets, as well as reviewing how underused space can \nprovide cost-effective opportunities for consolidation and repurposing to enhance space in order to \nbuild essential teaching and research capacity. With this key work complete, critical expansions \nwould be required only to meet the needs of tomorrow’s students, faculty, and researchers with a \nview to maintaining the institution’s competitive global positon. \nThe following tables identify the capital priorities detailed in the 2016 CIP, including those enabled \nby the Post-Secondary Institutions Strategic Investment Fund (SIF), and the resulting progress \nmade in 2016-2017. Estimated costs, where included, are taken directly from the CIP.

As the most obvious solutions have largely been adopted, attention is being \npaid to more formidable opportunities. \n• Utilities / District Energy System – Endeavouring to incorporate the latest technologies, \nUtilities is able to realize cost savings through active management of our power production \nand natural gas purchases, reducing the emissions and operating costs of the university and \nothers relying on us for utilities services. \n   67 \nA N N U A L  RE POR T  -  DR A FT \n• Energy Analytics – Employs an Enterprise Energy Information Management System to \nconsolidate, analyze, and normalize various real-time and historical energy related data \nsources providing energy usage history, benchmarking, recognition of anomalies, dashboard \ndisplays, and fault detection and diagnostics. \n• Envision – An investment of $35 million over six years will prevent 30,000 tonnes of \ngreenhouse gas emissions resulting in approximately $4.5 million in annual energy \nexpenditures. In addition to building on energy initiatives such as lighting retrofits, heating, \nventilation, and air conditioning, the emphasis is expanding to include water conservation, \ninfrastructure renewal, ancillary facilities, and renewable energy. \n• Universiade Pavilion – This nearly 6,000 m2 building is experiencing substantial energy loss \ndue to a failing exterior surface. Included in our BLIMS submission, preliminary estimates \nsuggest annual savings of 846 kW of electricity and 670 tonnes of carbon dioxide. \n• Cameron Library – Targeted as an opportunity for a unique partnership with student \nresearch, initiatives addressing the building envelope; specialized mechanical; and photo \nvoltaic and light shelves could see this iconic facility achieve up to 50 percent improvement in \nenergy efficiency. \n• Green Spaces Certification – Integrates sustainable practices into work and living using a \nseries of guides educating on waste reduction, water conservation, and energy efficiency. \n• Green Labs – Infrastructure projects making it easier for researchers to maintain \nenvironmentally responsible and healthy laboratories. \n• Bike Library – Funding support provided to the Students Union to facilitate bicycle lending. \n• Staff LRT – Eligible staff may travel between South Campus and Kingsway/Royal Alex for \nwork purposes. \n• Plug-In Power Cycling – Electricity to power outlets in campus parking facilities is cycled \ncommensurate with the ambient temperature. \n   68 \nA N N U A L  RE POR T  -  DR A FT \nPUBLIC INTEREST DISCLOSURE \nACTIVITY \nThe University of Alberta provides avenues for the safe disclosure of concerns related to \ndiscrimination and harassment, fraud and misconduct, financial irregularity, noncompliance in \nresearch, and other related issues. Of 131 disclosures received during the 2016-17 fiscal year, none \nqualified as a public interest disclosure under the Public Interest Disclosure (Whistleblower \nProtection) Act.  \n   69 \nA N N U A L  RE POR T  -  DR A FT \nMANAGEMENTS RESPONSIBILITY FOR \nREPORTING \nUniversity of Alberta’s management is responsible for the preparation, accuracy, objectivity and \nintegrity of the information contained in the Annual Report including the financial statements, \nperformance results and supporting management information. Systems of internal control are \ndesigned and maintained by management to produce reliable information to meet reporting \nrequirements. The system is designed to provide management with reasonable assurance that \ntransactions are properly authorized, are executed in accordance with all relevant legislation, \nregulations and policies, reliable financial records are maintained and assets are properly accounted \nfor and safeguarded. \nThe Annual Report has been developed under the oversight of the institution audit committee, as \nwell as approved by the Board of Governors and is prepared in accordance with the Fiscal Planning \nand Transparency Act and the Post-secondary Learning Act. \nThe Auditor General of the Province of Alberta, the institution’s external auditor appointed under the \nAuditor General Act, performs an annual independent audit of the consolidated financial statements \nwhich are prepared in accordance with Canadian public sector accounting standards. \nDavid H.

The \npresentation of net financial assets (net debt) includes portfolio investments that are restricted for \nendowments which cannot be used to pay for liabilities or future expenditures.  \nIn fulfilling its responsibilities and recognizing the limits inherent in all systems, management has \ndeveloped and maintains a system of internal control designed to provide reasonable assurance that \nuniversity assets are safeguarded from loss and that the accounting records are a reliable basis for \nthe preparation of the consolidated financial statements.  \nThe Board of Governors is responsible for reviewing and approving the consolidated financial \nstatements, and overseeing management’s performance of its financial reporting responsibilities.  \nThe Board of Governors carries out its responsibility for review of the consolidated financial \nstatements principally through its Audit Committee. With the exception of the President, all members \nof the Audit Committee are not employees of the university. The Audit Committee meets with \nmanagement and the external auditors and internal auditors to discuss the results of audit \nexaminations and financial reporting matters. The external and internal auditors have full access to \nthe Audit Committee, with and without the presence of management.  \nThese consolidated financial statements have been reported on by the Auditor General of Alberta, \nthe auditor appointed under the Post-secondary Learning Act. The Independent Auditor’s Report \noutlines the scope of the audit and provides the audit opinion on the fairness of presentation of the \ninformation in the consolidated financial statements. \nDavid H.
