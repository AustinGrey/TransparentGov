She added that the proposed requirements align with those of the other U15 institutions. Ms Collins noted that students not admitted due to the increased requirement would still be able to apply to the university through the bridging program. During the discussion, a member expressed concern that the data may have bias and that the use of first year GPA may skew the outcome since some students struggle in their first year of studies. A member suggested that some current students may not meet the new thresholds. Members discussed other options to improve proficiency such as a required English courses",

To discuss the Alberta credential framework. Discussion: The Provost and Vice-President (Academic), Steven Dew, assumed the Chair. The Chair reported that the provincial government has asked the university for input on a number of reviews including the tuition framework and the funding model; as part of this, there is also a review of institutional mandates and roles. He indicated that government is reviewing the six sector model into which all 26 post-secondary institutions are differentiated as part of the funding model review. He noted that six institutions have put forward requests to change the category they are in. The committee discussed the role of the Comprehensive Academic and Research Institutions (CARI) and the link between research and graduate degrees. Members noted that differentiation is essential to promote the uniqueness of the educational experience offered at the University of Alberta and to avoid duplication within the sector. Members also discussed the unique position of the University of Alberta in offering post-secondary programming in French. Members discussed pure and applied research and the entrance of non-CARI institutions into federal funding competitions. The Chair thanked the committee for their comments and invited them to contact him after the meeting with further thoughts. Mr Soltannia added that the Graduate Students’ Association (GSA) had also been asked for graduate student perspectives and would be providing input back to the province.",

Discussion: University Secretary Marion Haggarty-France provided members with an overview of the four foundation documents approved by GFC on the role and responsibilities of members, committee composition, delegations of authority and procedural rules, and recommendations of the ad hoc Committee. She stated that although GFC endorsed the report and recommendations in principle on April 21, 2017, further work will be required by GFC’s standing committees to refine Terms of Reference. GFC Secretary and Manager of GFC Services, Meg Brolley, led members through a discussion on the draft Terms of Reference of the committee. Members engaged in discussion on: the addition of research into the committee’s name and clarifying its mandate related to research; and several changes between APC and the GFC Academic Standards Committee (ASC) surrounding authority to suspend and terminate programs. Ms Brolley clarified that further consultation would occur on the recommendation to move CCA programming from GFC APC to the GFC ASC terms of reference. Members sought clarification on the recommendedation to include internationalization within the committee’s mandate and it was noted that internationalization is a big area for the university which includes tuition, globalization, and the ways in which a global university incorporates this into its mission and research. Discussion on membership composition included the recommendation to remove the Vice-President (Finance and Administration) and to have the Dean member elected by GFC. Members also provided comments surrounding whether additional members might be needed with the addition of research to the mandate including a post-doctoral fellow. The Chair noted that the discussion would continue well into the 2017-2018 academic year and would be a recurring one on future agendas.",

Research \nconducted by the Enrolment Management unit in the Office of the \nRegistrar shows the correlation between a higher overall ELP score and \nstudent success in first year courses, as indicated by final GPA and/or \ncourse withdrawals.  \nAs a result of the proposed changes, an increased number of applicants \nmight enter their chosen faculty/program through the Bridging program. \nThe number of International applications may decrease which may lead \nto a reduction in the number of students admitted.

Post-Secondary Learning Act (PSLA): The PSLA gives GFC \nresponsibility, subject to the authority of the Board of Governors, over \nacademic affairs (Section 26(1)). Further, the PSLA gives the Board of \nGovernors authority over certain admission requirements and rules \nrespecting enrolment (Sections 60(1)(c) and (d)). The Board has \ndelegated its authority over admissions requirements and rules \nrespecting enrolment to GFC. GFC has thus established an Academic \nStandards Committee (GFC ASC).  \n2. GFC Academic Standards Committee (ASC) Terms of Reference: \n“B. Admission and Transfer, Academic Standing, Marking and Grading, \nTerm Work, Examinations, International Baccalaureate (IB), Advanced \nPlacement (AP) \niv. ASC provides advice or recommends to the GFC Academic Planning \nCommittee (APC) on proposals which involve substantial change to \nadmission/transfer regulations or to academic standing regulations. \nv. ASC provides advice or recommends to APC on general University \nadmission or  \n3. UAPPOL Admissions Policy: “Admission to the University of Alberta \nis based on documented academic criteria established by individual \nFaculties and approved by GFC. These criteria may be defined in areas \nsuch as subject requirements, minimum entrance averages, and \nlanguage proficiency requirements. In addition to academic requirements \nfor admission, GFC authorizes each Faculty to establish such other \nreasonable criteria for admission of applicants as the Faculty may \nconsider appropriate to its programs of study, subject to the approval of \nGFC (e.g. interview, audition, portfolio, etc.)  \nThe admission requirements for any Faculty will be those approved by \nGFC as set forth in the current edition of the University Calendar. In \naddition to the admission requirements, selection criteria for quota \nprograms, where they exist, will also be published in the current edition \nof the University Calendar. The responsibility for admission decisions will \nbe vested in the Faculty Admission Committees or in the Deans of the \nrespective Faculties, as the councils of such Faculties will determine.” \n4. UAPPOL Admissions Procedure:  \n“PROCEDURE EFFECTIVE DATE OF CHANGES TO ADMISSION \nREGULATIONS  \nFollowing approval by GFC:  \na. Where changes to admission regulations may disadvantage students \nin the current admission cycle, normally implementation will be effective \nafter the change has been published in the University Calendar for one \nfull year (i.e., effective the second year that the information is published \nin the University Calendar). For example, a change approved in May \n2005 would be first published in the 2006-2007 University Calendar in \nItem No. 4 \nGFC ACADEMIC PLANNING COMMITTEE \nFor the Meeting of June 14, 2017 \nMarch 2006. Therefore the statement cannot come into effect until \nSeptember 2007 (affecting applicants who apply for the September 2007 \nterm beginning July 2006).”  \nb. Where changes to admission regulations are deemed by the \napproving body to be ‘advantageous to students’, normally the date of \nimplementation will be effective immediately or at the next available \nintake for the admitting Faculty. \n5. GFC Academic Planning Committee Terms of Reference  \n“7. Admission, Transfer and Academic Standing \na. To consider advice or recommendation from the GFC ASC on \nproposals for the establishment of or change to general University \nadmission or transfer policies affecting students, including policies \naffecting Open Studies students, and to act for GFC in approving \npolicies which in APC’s view are minor or routine; and to \nrecommend to GFC on proposals involving major change \nb. To consider advice or recommendation from GFC ASC on \nproposals which involve substantial change to admission/transfer \nor to academic standing regulations.” \n6. GFC Executive Committee Terms of Reference \n“GFC has delegated to the Executive Committee the authority to decide \nwhich items are placed on a GFC Agenda, and the order in which those \nagenda items appear on each GFC agenda. […]  \nWhen recommendations are forwarded to General Faculties Council \nfrom APC, the role of the Executive shall be to decide the order in which \nitems should be considered by GFC. The Executive Committee is \nresponsible for providing general advice to the Chair about proposals \nbeing forwarded from APC to GFC.” \nAttachments  \n1.

Changes to \nthese requirements began to be actively discussed in 2015.  At that time concerns were raised as to the \nwhether the existing minimum thresholds were sufficient to ensure student success. It was also noted that the \nELP requirements at the University of Alberta were lower than all our comparator institutions in the U15. \nPreliminary research conducted within the Faculty of Arts by Stuart Landon (June 2015) observed that there \nwas a positive correlation between IELTS scores and academic performance. Due to this interest and early \nresearch the Office of the Registrar conducted research more broadly and found good support for the proposed \nchanges to the minimum thresholds for IELTS and TOEFL. \nKey Issues to solve and support: \n● Student success \n● Institutional competitiveness \nAnalysis: \n● The analysis focussed on IELTS only as the most predominant method of meeting ELP  \n● Given that the six years of data used saw similar results across all year’s additional years of data have \nnot been added to the existing analysis \n● The analysis showed that the greatest gain for student success was found in elevating the IELTS band \nscore minimum from 5.0 to 5.5, raising it further did not have a large impact \n● Course withdrawal rates were not greatly impacted by a change in IELTS requirements \n● Of the students included in the analysis approximately 7% (individual years ranged from 4%-12%) \nwould no longer be admissible based on the proposed changes to the IELTS threshold \nFuture state: \n● Requirements that improve student success in first year \n● Requirements that are more consistent with other U15 institutions \n● Changes to IELTS and TOEFL will have the broadest impact on the applicant pool as they are the two \nmost predominant standardized test presented by applicants \n● IELTS change minimum band score to 5.5 (currently 5.0) with no change to the current overall score of \n6.5.  \n● TOEFL score to be increased to 90 and no change on the minimum band score of 21- The proposed \nchange in the TOEFL score is strictly the equivalent score increase to IELTS in the context of their \nscoring standard. We have included it here as it is the second most commonly used method of \nmeeting ELP. Most applicants using TOEFL are already meeting this standard. \n● Other methods of meeting ELP will be calibrated as needed and brought forth following these initial \nchanges.  \n1 IELTS and TOEFL are the most commonly presented means by which students attempt to meet ELP requirements, \nrepresenting on average 50% and 10% of the applicant pool each year respectively.  \nAttachment 2: Increase to Required English Language Proficiency (ELP) Scores for Undergraduate Admissions \n3 \nEnglish Language Proficiency Requirements for the U15 \nAccurate as of May 8, 2017 \n(Only U15 institutions offering programs delivered in English as the primary languages of instruction have been included- Universite \nLaval and Universite de Montreal have been excluded) \nInstitution IELTS TOEFL(iBT) Notes \n Total Component Total Component  \nU of A (current) 6.5 5 86 21 Applicants to teaching and health sciences disciplines \nneed a further level of spoken English Proficiency. \nA minimum score of 7.5 on IELTS Speaking or 26 on \nTOEFL speaking. \nUBC 6.5 6 90 Listening: 22 \nSpeaking & \nWriting: 21 \nU of T 6.5 6 100 Writing: 22 Discretionary Range: total score 89~99 & 19~21 on \nWriting \nMcGill 6.5 6 90 21 Education & Management: TOEFL score of 100  \nMusic: TOEFL score of 79~80 \nU of C 6.5 N/A 86 N/A Nursing: IELTS 7.0 with no components below a 7.0; \nTOEFL: 92 with no components below 23 \nEducation: IELTS 8.0 with no components below a 7.0; \nTOEFL 100 with no components below 27 \nMcMaster 6.5 5 86 20  \nWaterloo 6.5 Writing: 6.5 \nSpeaking: 6.5 \n90 Writing: 25 \nSpeaking: 25 \nAttachment 2: Increase to Required English Language Proficiency (ELP) Scores for Undergraduate Admissions \n4 \nReading: 6.0 \nListening: 6.0 \nQueens University 6.5 N/A 88 Writing:24  \nSpeaking: 22 \nReading: 22 \nListening: 20 \nDalhousie \nUniversity \n6.5 6 90 20  \nUniversity of \nManitoba \n6.5 N/A 86 20  \nU of Saskatchewan 6.5 6 86 19  \nWestern 6.5 6 83 20  \nU Ottawa \n(Programs offered \nin English) \n6.5 Writing: 6.5 86 22  \nFIRST YEAR GRADE POINT AVERAGES AND COURSE WITHDRAWALS AMONG REGISTERED HIGH \nSCHOOL AND POST-SECONDARY TRANSFER APPLICANTS WHO MET ELP REQUIREMENT BY IELTS  \n1.

Supremacy of academic priorities -- the university’s mission and academic priorities are \nparamount in all decision making. The budget model will facilitate the alignment of \nresources in support of the university core mandate of teaching and research. \nb. Transparency – the process for making resource allocation decisions is transparent and \nsources of institutional resources and comparative data are clearly identified and made \navailable  \nc. Accountability -- Faculty and unit leadership have the responsibility and authority to \nmake resource allocation decisions and are accountable for achieving performance \ntargets, including financial performance targets. \nd. Simplicity -- rules and processes are understandable and actionable \ne. Consistency -- rules are applied equitably across all Faculties and units. \nf. Predictability – long-term budget planning is facilitated.

Excerpt from Government consultation document on ABC review (Phase 3) (6 pages) \nPrepared by: University Governance \nhttp://www.governance.ualberta.ca/GovernanceToolkit/Toolkit.aspx\nhttp://www.governance.ualberta.ca/GovernanceToolkit/Toolkit.aspx\nReview of Agencies, Boards and Commissions (Phase 3) \nIn Fall 2015 the Government of Alberta announced a review of Alberta’s agencies, boards and \ncommissions (ABCs) to ensure they are effective, efficient and serving the best interests of Albertans. \nThe final phase of the ABC Review (Phase 3) was launched in February 2017, and is focused on:  \n• Reviewing executive compensation at Alberta’s 20 public post-secondary institutions;  \n• Reviewing conflicts of interest policies applicable to post-secondary institution board and \nexecutive office holders and developing recommendations to strengthen existing policies;  \n• Reviewing and identifying opportunities to strengthen governance of post-secondary boards and \nthe post-secondary system, and;  \n• Reviewing the roles and mandates of Alberta’s publicly funded post-secondary institutions. \nReview of the Roles and Mandates of Post-Secondary Institutions \nAlberta has 26 publicly funded post-secondary institutions located across all regions of the province1. In \n2007 the Government of Alberta introduced the Roles and Mandates Policy Framework for Alberta’s \nPublicly Funded Advanced Education System (R&M Framework) which established a six-sector model \nthat formally differentiated post-secondary institutions2. Institutional differentiation was based \nprimarily on the range of programming and research activity undertaken at each institution.  \nThe six-sector model and roles and mandates of post-secondary institutions have not been reviewed or \nformally updated since they were introduced in 2007, however, government did commit to undertaking \nthis review in the Advanced Education Business Plan 2016-19. As a component of Phase III of the ABC \nReview, the review of post-secondary roles and mandates will focus on: \n• Strengthening and updating the six sector model to ensure institutions are appropriately \ndifferentiated to meet the needs of learners, Alberta communities and the provincial economy. \n• Aligning system differentiation and institutional roles and mandates with the new vision and five \nprinciples that guide the post-secondary system3. \n• Addressing outstanding challenges that post-secondary institutions face in relation to their \nexisting role and mandate within the system. This will include addressing the six requests for \nchanges that government has received, although not all of those requests relate directly to \ninstitutional roles and mandates4. \nBeginning in March 2017, Advanced Education will be working with stakeholders including post-\nsecondary institutions, learners and faculty associations to meet the objectives outlined above. A review \nof the roles and mandates of post-secondary institutions is timely due to a number of factors including: \n• The Alberta government recently developed a new vision and five principles to guide the adult \nlearning system (affordability, accessibility, quality, accountability and coordination). It is \nimportant that the post-secondary system is differentiated in a manner that reflects and supports \nthese principles. \n1 See appendix A  \n2 See appendix B  \n3 See appendix C  \n4 See appendix D \nRoles and Mandates Review – Initial Consultation \n  Page 2 of 6 \n• Some post-secondary institutions have formally submitted requests for changes that can be dealt \nwith through the review of roles and mandates. By addressing these requests through the \nbroader review of roles and mandates, government can ensure that any changes that are made \nin order to address the challenges these institutions are facing do not have unintended \nconsequences that impact the broader system. \n• The province of Alberta and the adult learning system have evolved over the past decade. While \nthe six-sector model has served the province well over this period, there is a need to modernize, \nclarify and update system differentiation and the roles and mandates of post-secondary \ninstitutions in response to those changes. \nFOIP NOTICE \nAdvanced Education is collecting personal information in this survey under the authority of section 33(c) \nof the Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act (FOIP), for the purposes of informing the \nreview of roles and mandates of post-secondary institutions in Alberta. The use and disclosure of your \npersonal information is managed in accordance with the FOIP Act: If you are under 18 years of age, \nplease review this notice with your parent or guardian. If you have any questions about the collection or \nuse of this information, please contact the Manager, FOIP Coordination, 5th Floor, Phipps-McKinnon \nBuilding, 10020 – 101A Avenue, Edmonton, Alberta, T5J 3G2 or by telephone at 780-422-1029. \nRoles and Mandates Review – Initial Consultation \n  Page 3 of 6 \nDiscussion Questions \nSystem Differentiation \n1) Does the current six-sector model, which is based primarily on institutional programming and \nresearch activity, clearly differentiate institutional roles and mandates? If no, please elaborate. \n2) Given that government has introduced a new vision and principles for the post-secondary \nsector, should system differentiation be more focused on or include other institutional features, \naside from programming and research? If so, what are those features and why are they \nimportant for the purpose of system differentiation?  \nSystem Alignment with Vision and Principles \n3) In relation to the review of Roles and Mandates, does the current six-sector model effectively \nreflect and support the system vision and the five system principles? Please explain your \nanswer.  \n4) What changes would you make to the six-sector model related to Roles and Mandates, to better \nreflect and support the system vision and five system principles? \n5) Do you believe that some post-secondary institutions should be mandated to focus on certain \nprinciples over others (e.g. quality over access), or should all post-secondary institutions be \nfocused on reflecting all five principles equally? Please explain your answer specifically in \nrelation to the review of Roles and Mandates. \nProgramming and Research Mandates \n6) Is the current range of programming and research for each of the six sectors appropriate? Please \nexplain your answer.  \n7) What changes would you make to the current range of programming and research for each of \nthe six sectors (if any)? \n8) Given that post-secondary institutions in Alberta must be differentiated to maximize system \nresources, and that different regions have unique and important needs, how can government \nhelp to ensure that learners in all regions of the province have access to the programming and \nresearch opportunities they need? For example, through institutional collaboration, \npartnerships, etc.? \n9) Based on your answers to the questions above, do you believe your institution needs a change \nin its role and mandate in the province’s adult learning system? If yes, please elaborate.  \nCurrent Requests for Changes \n10) Appendix D provides an overview of the six requests that the department has received from \npost-secondary institutions in recent months/years. Please provide your perspective with regard \nto how these changes, if approved, would impact the broader post-secondary system, other \npost-secondary institutions, and learners.  \nRoles and Mandates Review – Initial Consultation \n  Page 4 of 6 \nAPPENDIX B  \nOverview of Current System Differentiation  \nThe post-secondary education system configuration is defined by six sectors, differentiated primarily by \ncredentials offered, type and intensity of research undertaken within each sector, and geographic focus. \nKey defining characteristics of each sector include:  \n• Comprehensive Academic Research Institutions have the exclusive mandate to focus on \ninstructional excellence and are the sector primarily responsibility for research activities in the \nsystem. Institutions within this sector are not required to provide any programming other than \ndegree programs (both undergraduate and graduate), and may undertake all forms of research \n(applied, scholarly and pure).  \n• Baccalaureate and Applied Studies Institutions are mandated to provide certificate, diploma and \napplied degree programs. These institutions are limited to baccalaureate degree programs in \nspecified areas, and cannot offer graduate level programming. They are also limited to applied and \nscholarly research activities. \n• Polytechnical Institutions have a unique focus on providing training geared predominantly to \ntechnical careers, including through apprenticeship, certificate, and diploma programs. These \ninstitutions may provide some baccalaureate degrees in specified areas, but are not permitted to \nprovide any graduate-level programs and are limited to undertaking only applied and scholarly \nresearch. \n• The sector with the broadest, most conditional mandate is the Comprehensive Community \nInstitutions sector. Institutions within this sector may provide apprenticeship programs where \ndemand warrants, certificate, diploma, foundational learning and upgrading. They may also offer \nuniversity transfer (years one and two) and applied degrees, as well as baccalaureate degrees, if \nfeasible. In some circumstances, these institutions may be permitted to offer degree programs \nindependently, subject to a Campus Alberta system review. Institutions in this sector may only \nconduct applied and scholarly research.  \n• Institutions within the Independent Academic Institutions sector may offer baccalaureate degree \nprograms “primarily” in liberal arts, science and education. Graduate programming may be offered \nonly in niche areas where demand warrants and where it is not duplicative. These institutions may \nonly undertake applied and scholarly research activities.  \n• The Specialized Arts and Culture Institutions sector is unique. The sector description does not \nmandate or restrict these institutions from offering any specific credential types and does not \nreference research activities. Instead, the description of this sector suggests that these institutions \nconcentrate on fine arts, cultural programming, and professional development, and must consider \ngeographical reach and client base, which is Alberta and beyond. \nDifferentiation may exist between institutions within a single sector. This allows for program or field of \nstudy specializations based on institutional strengths, delivery models or client groups served.  \nRoles and Mandates Review – Initial Consultation \n  Page 5 of 6 \nAPPENDIX C \nRoles and Mandates Review – Initial Consultation \n  Page 6 of 6 \nItem No. 7 \nGFC ACADEMIC PLANNING COMMITTEE \nFor the Meeting of June 14, 2017 \nOUTLINE OF ISSUE \n Discussion Item  \nAgenda Title: Report and Recommendations of the ad hoc Committee on Academic Governance \nIncluding Delegated Authority with respect to the GFC Academic Planning Committee \nItem   \nProposed by Chair, General Faculties Council \nPresenter Steven Dew, Chair, GFC Academic Planning Committee  \nMarion Haggarty France, University Secretary \nMeg Brolley, GFC Secretary \nDetails \nResponsibility General Faculties Council \nThe Purpose of the item is \n(please be specific) \nTo review and discuss the recommendations of the ad hoc committee \nand the impact on the mandate and responsibilities of the GFC \nAcademic Planning Committee as reflected in the terms of reference. \nTimeline/Implementation Date Fall 2017 – revisions to terms of reference  \nSupplementary Notes and \ncontext \nOn April 21, 2017, General Faculties Council approved the following \nguiding documents submitted by the ad hoc Committee on Academic \nGovernance Including Delegated Authority: \n- Principles for Delegation of Authority \n- Principles for Standing Committee Composition \n- Roles and Responsibilities of Members \n- Meeting Procedural Rules \nIn addition, GFC approved in principle and endorsed the Report of the ad \nhoc committee which contained numerous recommendations including \nrevisions to standing committees and other matters.  \nTo ensure that the recommendations in the report will be completed, and \nto facilitate a smooth transition, as suggested in the report, GFC \nExecutive Committee will oversee and facilitate the implementation of \nthe recommendations on or before April 2019.  \nIt is anticipated, however, that committees will refine the draft terms of \nreference and return to GFC with revised terms of reference beginning in \nthe fall 2017. \nEngagement and Routing (Include meeting dates) \nParticipation: \n(parties who have seen the \nproposal and in what capacity) \n<For further information see \nthe link posted on \nthe Governance Toolkit section \nStudent Participation Protocol> \nThose who have been informed: \n• University community \nThose who have been consulted: \n• See attached for full list of ad hoc committee consultations \nThose who are actively participating: \n• GFC Academic Planning Committee \nhttp://www.governance.ualberta.ca/GovernanceToolkit/Toolkit.aspx\nhttp://www.governance.ualberta.ca/GovernanceToolkit/Toolkit.aspx\nItem No. 7 \nGFC ACADEMIC PLANNING COMMITTEE \nFor the Meeting of June 14, 2017 \nAlignment/Compliance \nAlignment with Guiding \nDocuments \nFor the Public Good \nObjective 21 \nEncourage continuous improvement in administrative, governance, \nplanning and stewardship systems, procedures, and policies that \nenable students, faculty, staff, and the institutions as a whole to \nachieve shared strategic goals. \nCompliance with Legislation, \nPolicy and/or Procedure \nRelevant to the Proposal \n(please quote legislation and \ninclude identifying section \nnumbers) \n1.

List of consultations – ad hoc Committee on Academic Governance Including Delegated Authority \nPrepared by: University Governance \n1 of 2 \nGENERAL FACULTIES COUNCIL \nPrinciples of Delegation \nPrinciples for General Faculties Council Delegation of Authority \nIntroduction \nGovernance is understood as the process through which an organization defines and achieves \nits mandate, which includes making decisions with regard to the structures, policies, and \npractices of decision-making; the exercise of authority; and the mechanisms of accountability.  \nGeneral Faculties Council (GFC) has employed a structure that relies upon the delegation of its \nprovincially-mandated authorities to its standing committees, individuals on campus and other \ncampus bodies.  Delegation is essential to ensure timely and efficient decision-making in \nsmaller forums with access to appropriate resource people, while allowing GFC to focus on \nsubstantive and strategic issues of broad relevance to the university community.  The following \noffers guidance to this delegation structure and helps maintain accountability, transparency, and \ncollegiality in the academic governance system at the University of Alberta. \nRetained Authority \nGeneral Faculties Council shall pursue major policy and strategic issues that include: \n● significant strategic and policy issues related to the academic affairs of the university;\n● any matter involving the alteration of the mandate, terms of reference, membership, or\nstructure of a GFC standing committee; and\n● those matters that a standing committee, body, or officer holding delegated authority\nfrom GFC considers to be of major strategic significance or long-term impact on the\nuniversity.\nPrinciples \n1. Delegations of authority must be reasonable in scope and appropriate to the character and\ncapacity of the body (e.g. council or committee) or officer receiving the delegated authority. \n2. An officer or body acting with delegated authority is accountable to the body which\ndelegated the authority and must report to that body in a timely and sufficiently detailed\nfashion on actions taken under the delegated authority.\n3. An officer or body is responsible to be alert to situations where, for example, there is\nuncertainty as to whether an item falls within the intended delegation or the significance of\nan issue and the division of opinion on the issue suggest it is prudent to refer the issue or\ndecision to the delegating body for consideration. When there is uncertainty as to whether\nan item falls within the intended delegated authority, or if there is clear division of opinion,\nthe officer or body with delegated authority will refer the item to the body that delegated the\nauthority along with a recommendation.\n4. Delegations should be recorded in written form and curated in a transparent manner.\n2 of 2 \nGENERAL FACULTIES COUNCIL \nPrinciples of Delegation \n 5. A body delegating authority may impose restrictions on that authority -- including restrictions \non the authority to sub-delegate -- so long as the restrictions allow sufficient authority for the \ndelegation to be meaningful. \n6. All delegations of authority should be reviewed at regular intervals (ideally once every three \nyears) to ensure they remain appropriate. \n7. Withdrawal of delegated authority should be considered judiciously based on the best \ninterest of the institution and cannot be done retroactively. \n8. An officer or body is not compelled to exercise delegations. The fact that a delegation is held \ndoes not oblige the officer or body to exercise the delegation if, in the opinion of the \ndelegate, some special or unusual circumstances are involved which make it sensible that \nthe issue should receive consideration at a more senior level. \nApproved by General Faculties Council: <insert date> \n1 of 1 \nGENERAL FACULTIES COUNCIL \nPrinciples of Committee Composition \nPrinciples for General Faculties Council Standing Committee Composition \nIntroduction \nGovernance at the University of Alberta relies upon a structure wherein the General Faculties \nCouncil has delegated many of its provincially-mandated authorities to its standing committees.  \nAs such, the composition of those standing committees is crucial to ensuring that decisions are \nmade in an informed manner that takes into account the breadth of issues, perspectives and \nopinions on campus.  The following principles provide a framework to create committee \ncompositions which are reflective of the membership of GFC and appropriate to the role and \nmandate of those committees.  \nPrinciples \n1. Wherever possible, the majority of elected members of each standing committee should be\ndrawn from the membership of GFC to provide tangible links between GFC and its standing\ncommittees and increase engagement of the greater GFC community.\n2. Wherever possible, the number of elected members of a standing committee should exceed\nthe number of ex-officio members.\n3. The voting status of ex-officio members of standing committees should be consistent with\ntheir voting status on GFC and should extend to their delegates.\n4. Ex-officio members should be included in the membership of a standing committee only\nwhen their portfolio is directly relevant to the mandate and role of the standing committee.\n5. Wherever possible, the Vice-Chair of a standing committee should be elected by the\ncommittee from its elected academic staff members and ideally be a member of GFC.\n6. Standing Committees should be populated with a commitment to diversity and broad\nrepresentation from across the university.\n7. When cross-appointment of members on standing committees is appropriate, this should be\noutlined in the terms of reference of each committee and such members shall have voting\nstatus on both committees.\nApproved by General Faculties Council: <insert date> \n1 of 2 \nGENERAL FACULTIES COUNCIL \nRoles and Responsibilities of Members \nRoles and Responsibilities of Members \nIntroduction \nGeneral Faculties Council (GFC) is the principal academic decision-making body of the \nuniversity. It is established in the Post-Secondary Learning Act (PSLA) and given authority, \nsubject to the Board of Governors, over the academic affairs of the university. \nFor GFC to be successful in fulfilling its terms of reference and meeting its responsibilities to the \nuniversity it depends on the active engagement of its members. GFC has delegated much of its \nauthority for routine matters to standing committees allowing GFC to engage in high level \nstrategic and stewardship policy issues. GFC members have the opportunity to serve on the \nstanding committees that approve matters with the delegated authority from GFC.  \nGFC operates under the principle of collegial academic governance including: \n• A commitment to inclusive and participatory governance decision-making\n• A desire to facilitate meaningful individual-level engagement in governance processes\n• A commitment to openness, transparency, and respectful communication\n• A commitment to responsiveness, respect, and reciprocity between governing bodies\nand between governing bodies and university administration\nRoles and Responsibilities of Members \n1. Understand GFC\n1.1 Members should understand that not all matters under GFC jurisdiction will come\nbefore that body for approval. Some decisions are made at the standing committee \nlevel as GFC has delegated authority to approve and report on actions taken on certain \nmatters.   \n1.2 The university operates in a bicameral governance system. Members should \nunderstand the distinction between the role and responsibilities of GFC and the Board \nof Governors. \n2. Meeting Attendance\n2.1 Members have a responsibility to attend GFC meetings.\na. If a student misses two consecutive meetings, or more than three meetings in one\nacademic year, the Students’ Union or the Graduate Students’ Association may\nrequest that the Chair declare the position vacant.\nb. If a Faculty representative or a non-student member misses two consecutive\nmeetings or more than three meetings in one academic year without a reason\nsatisfactory to the members of the GFC Executive Committee, the Executive\nCommittee shall declare the position vacant.\n2.2 Members have a responsibility to serve on GFC committees as appropriate and attend \ncommittee meetings. \na. If an elected member is absent from three consecutive meetings or is frequently\nabsent without a reason satisfactory to the remaining members of the committee, the \nChair shall declare the position vacant. \n2 of 2 \nGENERAL FACULTIES COUNCIL \nRoles and Responsibilities of Members \n2.3 Members should advise the GFC Secretary or committee coordinator if they are unable \nto attend a meeting. \n3.  Participate in GFC Business \n3.1 Members should prepare for meetings by reviewing agenda materials in advance that, \nfor open sessions, are publicly available at governance.ualberta.ca \n 3.2 Members should engage in candid and respectful discussion of matters which are \nbrought before GFC and its various bodies  \n3.3 When voting on motions: \na. Members must act in good faith with the view to the best interests of the university as \na whole. While members may be informed by matters raised by various \nconstituencies, it is the duty of a member to ensure that all constituencies are fairly \nconsidered in the process of decision making.  \nb. When notified of an e-vote, members should vote in a timely manner in order to \nensure that quorum requirements are met.  \n4.  Manage Conflict of Interest and Act Ethically \n4.1 Comply with the university’s policies and procedures regarding both ethical conduct and \nconflict of interest.  Members must declare conflicts when they arise.  \n4.2 Maintain confidentiality of all information included in closed session meetings.  \n5.  Ask Questions \n5.1 Information requests may be made of the University Governance office, should \nmembers require more information than is provided with the meeting agenda. \n5.2 If a member wishes to raise a question at GFC within the jurisdiction of the body, a \nquestion may be submitted in writing to the GFC Secretary up to six working days \nbefore the next GFC meeting to receive a written response. \n5.3 Every GFC meeting has Question Period as a standing item wherein members may \nraise a question during the time set aside for this item. Procedures for Question Period \nare available at governance.ualberta.ca \n5.4 If a member has a question with regard to an item on the agenda, it may be raised \nduring consideration of that item at the GFC meeting. \n5.5 If a member wishes to add an item to the agenda for debate, the member should \ncontact the Chair or GFC Secretary for assistance. \n6.  Communicate Information to Constituents \n6.1 Members should communicate with their Faculty or constituency regarding agenda \nitems coming before GFC.  \n6.2 Members should communicate with their Faculty or constituency on matters which were \ndiscussed/approved at GFC in Open Session. \nApproved at General Faculties Council <insert date> \nhttp://www.governance.ualberta.ca/\nhttps://policiesonline.ualberta.ca/PoliciesProcedures/Policies/Ethical-Conduct-and-Safe-Disclosure-Policy.pdf\nhttps://policiesonline.ualberta.ca/PoliciesProcedures/Policies/Conflict-Policy--Conflict-of-Interest-and-Commitment-and-Institutional-Conflict.pdf\nhttp://www.governance.ualberta.ca/GeneralFacultiesCouncil/%7E/media/Governance/Documents/GO05/GEN/Linked%20Documents%20on%20GFC%20Home%20Page/Question-Period-Excerpt-from-the-2006-GFC-PM.pdf\nhttp://www.governance.ualberta.ca/GeneralFacultiesCouncil/%7E/media/Governance/Documents/GO05/GEN/Linked%20Documents%20on%20GFC%20Home%20Page/Question-Period-Excerpt-from-the-2006-GFC-PM.pdf\n1 of 6 \nGENERAL FACULTIES COUNCIL \nMeeting Procedural Rules  \nMeeting Procedural Rules \n Introduction \nGeneral Faculties Council (GFC) has on many occasions confirmed its commitment to having a \nset of rules that assist rather than impede the conduct of business. GFC rules are not meant to \nunduly restrict debate or limit opportunities for participation. Their purpose is to facilitate \ninclusive and respectful dialogue, while ensuring efficient decision-making. It is the responsibility \nof the Chair, with the support of GFC, to employ the rules governing general meetings in a \nmanner consistent with these principles. Substantive motions should be handled with \nconsiderable formality, but whenever possible the Chair should deal with matters of procedure \nby general agreement. \nThe following rules and procedures are based on a number of fundamental principles that \nencourage participation and engagement of members. These principles include: \n• A commitment to inclusive and participatory decision-making. \n• A commitment to openness, transparency and respectful communication. \n1.  Procedural Rules  \n1.1  GFC and its standing committees are governed by the procedural rules set out below. \nFor matters not covered by these rules, or by the Post Secondary Learning Act (PSLA) \nreference shall be made to the current edition of Robert's Rules of Order. If this does \nnot provide clear direction regarding a point in question, then the Chair shall decide \nhow to proceed. However, such rulings by the Chair may be overruled via a motion \nsupported by a vote of the majority of those present.  \n1.2  The chairs of GFC and its standing committees will be responsible for guiding \nmeetings of GFC and its standing committees, enforcing rules, and deciding questions \npertaining to those rules. Any decisions of the chair are subject to challenge (see \n10.3). \n1.3 The Chair will not participate actively in debate regarding a motion before GFC without \npassing the role of the Chair to the Vice-Chair for the duration of the debate and the \nsubsequent vote.  \n2. Meetings \n 2.1 GFC and its standing committees shall meet regularly during the academic year, the \nschedule of which will be published on the governance website at least one month \nbefore the beginning of each academic year. GFC meetings will not be scheduled \nduring the period set aside for final examinations or Reading Week, however \ncommittee meetings may occur during this time. \n 2.2 Cancellation - GFC Executive Committee may cancel a meeting of GFC if it \ndetermines that the number and nature of the agenda items make it reasonable to \ndefer consideration, and provided that notice of such cancellation is given to members \nat least one week prior to the date of the meeting. The Chair of a GFC standing \ncommittee may cancel a meeting if the agenda items make it reasonable to defer \n2 of 6 \nGENERAL FACULTIES COUNCIL \nMeeting Procedural Rules   \n consideration, and provided that notice of such cancellation is given to members as \nearly as possible.  \n 2.3  From time to time, the Chair of GFC may call special meetings of GFC, provided that \nnotice of such meetings is given to members at least one month in advance.  \n 2.4 GFC meetings shall normally be scheduled and planned to end two hours after being \ncalled to order. \n 2.5 Debate on new items of business will not be entertained after GFC has been sitting for \nthree hours.  \n 2.6 No audio or video recording of meetings shall be permitted unless by express authority \nof the Chair. \n3. Open Sessions \n 3.1 Meetings of GFC and its standing committees are normally held in open session, with \nthe exception of those dealing with nominations and adjudication which are always \nheld in closed session. \n 3.2 Subject to the limitations of space and orderly conduct as determined by the chair, \nmembers of the university community and the general public may attend open \nmeetings as observers. Observers may only speak if expressly invited to do so by the \nChair.  \n4. Closed Sessions \n 4.1 From time to time, GFC or its committees may hold meetings or portions of meetings \nas closed meetings; at that point, proceedings will be confidential and all non-\nmembers, except those specifically invited, will be asked to withdraw. \n5.  Questions  \n5.1  If more information than is provided as part of the meeting agenda is required, \ninformation requests may be made of the University Governance office. \n5.2  Questions on an issue within GFC’s jurisdiction may be submitted in writing to the GFC \nSecretary up to six working days before the next GFC meeting to receive a written \nresponse. \n5.3  Every GFC meeting has Question Period as a standing item wherein members may \nraise a question during the time set aside for this item (see 6.5). Procedures for \nQuestion Period are available at governance.ualberta.ca \n5.4  Questions with regard to a specific item on an agenda may be raised during \nconsideration of that item at the GFC meeting. \n6.  Agendas \n 6.1  The agenda of each GFC meeting will be proposed by the GFC Executive Committee \nand approved by GFC. The GFC Executive Committee will ensure that items put \nbefore GFC are complete and ready for discussion and published in advance of the \nmeeting.  \nhttp://www.governance.ualberta.ca/GeneralFacultiesCouncil/%7E/media/Governance/Documents/GO05/GEN/Linked%20Documents%20on%20GFC%20Home%20Page/Question-Period-Excerpt-from-the-2006-GFC-PM.pdf\n3 of 6 \nGENERAL FACULTIES COUNCIL \nMeeting Procedural Rules   \n  6.2 If GFC members want to have an issue debated, they are asked to submit the issue to \nthe GFC Executive Committee. Whenever possible, members wishing to add items to \nthe agenda should contact the Chair or GFC Secretary two weeks in advance of the \nGFC Executive Committee meeting to allow time for the item to be added to the \nagenda. \n 6.3 Should a member wish to add an item to the agenda at a meeting of GFC, a two-thirds \nvote of those present is required; the Chair will then determine where the item appears \non the agenda. In cases where the Chair or GFC Secretary has been informed in \nadvance of a planned request to add a new item, but after the agenda has been \npublished, the proposal shall be circulated to members through the normal means. \n 6.4 When the Agenda is being approved, the Chair will entertain a request to change the \norder of items, for specified reasons.  \n 6.5 Each agenda of GFC and its standing committees will include Question Period of one \nhalf hour in length that may be extended with the approval of members.  \na. Question period is comprised of both written questions and, time permitting, \nquestions from the floor.   \nb. The Chair will rule on whether a question from the floor can be answered \nexpeditiously; if not, it will be referred to the appropriate officer for response at the \nnext meeting.  \n 6.6 Reports from standing committees are included on the GFC agenda for information \nonly. Questions may be asked for clarification, but no debate may take place on such \nitems. \n 6.7 Reports for Information may be moved to the discussion part of the agenda if a \nmember gives two days notice to the GFC Secretary to ensure that an appropriate \nperson is present to answer questions that may arise during discussion.  \n 6.8   Agendas and materials for open session meetings are posted at \ngovernance.ualberta.ca \n7. Quorum  \n 7.1 General Faculties Council -  The quorum for a GFC meeting is one-third of the total \nmembership, except in the months of May through August when the quorum shall be \none-quarter of the total membership.  \n 7.2 GFC Standing Committees – The quorum for standing committee meetings is one-half \nof the voting members or, in the case where this is an even number, one-half plus 1 \nmember.  \n 7.3 Vacancies on committees are not included when establishing quorum. \n 7.4 Maintaining quorum - A duly-called meeting which starts with a quorum present shall \nbe deemed to have a continuing quorum, notwithstanding the departure of voting \nmembers, unless the quorum is challenged by a voting member. In the event of a \nchallenge, the remaining members may choose to adjourn or continue the meeting.

However, the Chair may \ninterrupt a speaker if the speaker is out of order by using unacceptable language, is \nabusive of other members, or is not speaking to the motion. If the Chair does not do \nso, a member may raise this as a point of order.  \n 10.3  Point of Order - It is the right of any member who notices a breach of the rules of \nCouncil to insist on their enforcement. If the Chair fails to notice such a breach, any \nmember may make the appropriate Point of Order, calling on the Chair for a ruling.

If there appears to \nbe opposition to closing the debate, the Chair may ask for a motion to close debate. If \nseconded, members will then vote on this motion and proceed accordingly.  \n11. Debates without Motions \n11.1  When discussion of an issue and the formal rules pertaining to making motions, \ndebate, and voting seem to be a hindrance to thoughtful discussion, the GFC agenda \ncan allow for a less structured discussion guided by the Chair and the consensus of \nthe members in attendance.  \n12. Attendance  \n 12.1 Delegates – members who serve on GFC or its standing committees by virtue of their \noffice may send a delegate; such delegates shall act with all the rights of membership.  \nThere shall be no alternates for other members. \n 12.2 GFC attendance - If a student misses two consecutive meetings or more than three \nmeetings, the Students’ Union or the Graduate Students’ Association may request that \nthe Chair declare the position vacant.

Memo from Vice-Provost and Dean Zwicker to APC (pages 1-1) \nPrepared by: Janice Hurlburt, Graduate Governance and Policy Coordinator, jhurlbur@ualberta.ca \nFaculty of Graduate Studies and Research \n1 \nInterdepartmental Correspondence Killam Centre for Advanced Studies www.gradstudies.ualberta.ca Tel: 780.492.3499 \n 2-29 Triffo Hall  Fax: 780.492.0692 \nTo: GFC Academic Planning Committee Date: June  5, 2017 \nFrom:   Heather Zwicker, Vice-Provost and Dean \nFaculty of Graduate Studies and Research \nRe: Graduate Degree (second-level) Specializations \nThe following proposals for graduate degree specializations or modifications to approved specializations \nwithin existing graduate degrees were submitted to the Faculty of Graduate Studies and Research. \nStudents with approved graduate degree specializations will have the designation appear on the thesis \ntitle page, transcript, and parchment, as a second level specialization. Before graduate degree \nspecializations are approved by the FGSR, it must be clear that the department’s proposed designation \ndoes not require significant additional resources, that it has sufficient viability in terms of numbers of \nacademic staff in the research area, and that a library impact assessment has been completed. \nAccording to the Academic Planning Committee’s terms of reference, all proposals for the establishment \nof graduate degree specializations shall be submitted to the Dean of the Faculty of Graduate Studies and \nResearch. The Dean, after consultation, may approve proposals which do not involve base operating or \ncapital funds; the Dean will report these approvals to the Academic Planning Committee for information. \nListed below are proposals approved since August 1, 2016. \nDepartment of Surgery \nExisting Specialization in MSc and \nPhD programs  \nRename as \nExperimental Surgery  \nSurgery \nThis is a clean-up so that the Government of Alberta program Database (PaPRS) and the UofA \nprogram set up are aligned. The original program was approved in the 1970’s. \nDepartment of Surgery \nNew Specialization in MSc and PhD \nprograms \nSurgical Education \n[New] \nThe new specialization will complement the existing MSc program in Surgery, and will \nallow students to apply their new skills to answer important research questions in the  \nfield of surgical education. It will also help build strong cross-faculty, interdisciplinary \nconnections between students and teachers in the Department of Surgery and the \nFaculty of Education. No new courses are required for the new specialization; instead, \ngraduate-level instruction will be provided by combining existing courses offered by the \nDepartment of Surgery, the Faculty of Education, and other Faculties as required. This \nwill allow us to capitalize on the strengths of existing courses in other disciplines and to \nmodel inter-disciplinary collaboration. \nhttp://www.gradstudies.ualberta.ca/\n\tItem-1-Agenda\n\tItem-4-Required-ELP-Scores-Undergraduate\n\tELP Proposal \n\tAttachment 1_CaseforAction\n\tAttachment 2_U15ELPrequirementcomparison\n\tAttachment 3_ IELTS Band Score Group Analysis \n\tAttachment 4_CalendarChanges\n\tItem-5-Budget-Model-Principles\n\tBudget Model Principles \n\tatt-1-UAlberta Budget Model Principles June 2\n\tItem-6-Govt-roles-credentials\n\tgovt-roles-credentials\n\tatt-1-discussion-govt-roles-and-credentials\n\tItem-7-APC-discussion-ad-hoc-recommendations\n\tAPC discussion of ad hoc report and recommendations\n\tatt-1-Guiding Documents\n\tPrinciples for Delegation of Authority\n\tPrinciples of Committee Composition\n\tRoles and Responsibilities of Members\n\tMeeting Procedural Rules\n\tatt-2-ad hoc committee recommendations ARPC\n\tSheet1\n\tatt-3-draft ARPC ToR\n\tatt-4-current-terms-Academic-Planning-Committee\n\tatt-5-Ad Hoc Consultations List\n\tItem-9-For-Info-FGSR-Specializations\n\t9- FGSR Specializations 2016 to 2017 6.8.17\n\t9-att-1-APC FGSR-Specializations for info 08.01.2016 to 04.01.2017\n",
