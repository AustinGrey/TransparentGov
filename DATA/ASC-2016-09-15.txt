Post-Secondary Learning Act (PSLA): The PSLA gives GFC \nresponsibility, subject to the authority of the Board of Governors, over \nacademic affairs. Further, the PSLA gives the Board of Governors \nauthority over certain admission requirements and rules respecting \nenrolment of students to take courses. The Board has delegated its \nauthority over these areas to GFC. GFC has thus established, and \ndelegated certain powers to, an Academic Standards Committee. \n2.  PSLA \n“29(1) A faculty council may:  \n[…] \n(c) provide for the admission of students to the faculty, \n(d) determine the conditions under which a student must withdraw from \nor may continue the student’s program of studies in the faculty \n[…] \nsubject to any conditions or restrictions that are imposed by the general \nfaculties council. \n3.  GFC ASC Terms of Reference (Mandate of the Committee) \n“D. Alberta Transfer Guide \ni. ASC approves, for inclusion in the Alberta Transfer Guide, courses \nfor transfer credit to the University of Alberta which are offered by non-\nUniversity institutions in Alberta. Approval will be based upon an \nassessment of course content and level of instructor qualifications.  \nii. ASC denies courses for transfer credit to the University of Alberta \nwhich are offered by non-University institutions in Alberta.  \niii. ASC monitors the entries in the Alberta Transfer Guide relevant to \nthe University of Alberta.  \niv. ASC rescinds, if necessary, the entries in the Alberta Transfer \nGuide relevant to the University of Alberta.”  \n4.  UAPPOL Transfer Credit Articulation Procedure (Overview and \nItem 5: page 2\nItem No. 5A - F \nGFC ACADEMIC STANDARDS COMMITTEE \nFor the Meeting of September 15, 2016 \nProcedure):  “The University of Alberta will accept for transfer credit the \ncourses recommended by Faculties and approved by ASC for inclusion \nin the Alberta Transfer guide, to the extent that the courses fit the degree \nprogram that the student wishes to enter. Credit for such courses will be \nconsidered in a credit-no credit basis only and will not be included in the \nUniversity grade point average calculation on the University transcript. \nFaculties may have other requirements…Transfer credit is assessed on \nan individual course-by-course basis for by a block transfer agreement.” \n5. GFC Academic Standards Committee Terms of Reference \n(Mandate of the Committee) \n“A. Definitions \ni. “Routine and/or Editorial \n[…] \nthe term “routine and/or editorial” refers to proposals which do not \ninvolve or affect other Faculties or units; do not form part of a proposal \nfor a new program; and which do not involve alteration of an existing \nquota or establishment of a new quota. Editorial or routine changes \ninclude any and all changes to the wording of an admissions or \nacademic standing policy. \n[…] \n B. Admission and Transfer, Academic Standing, Marking and Grading, \nTerm Work, Examinations, International Baccalaureate (IB), Advanced \nPlacement (AP) \ni. All proposals from the Faculties or the Administration related to \nadmission and transfer, to the academic standing of students, to \ninstitutional marking and grading policies and/or procedures and to term \nwork policies and procedures are submitted to the Provost and Vice-\nPresident (Academic) (or delegate) who chairs the GFC Academic \nStandards Committee. ASC will consult as necessary with the Faculties \nand with other individuals and offices in its consideration of these \nproposals. \nii. ASC acts for GFC in approving routine and/or editorial changes to \nboth admission/transfer policies and academic standing regulations” \n3. UAPPOL Admissions Policy: “Admission to the University of Alberta \nis based on documented academic criteria established by individual \nFaculties and approved by GFC. This criteria may be defined in areas \nsuch as subject requirements, minimum entrance averages, and \nlanguage proficiency requirements. In addition to academic requirements \nfor admission, GFC authorizes each Faculty to establish such other \nreasonable criteria for admission of applicants as the Faculty may \nconsider appropriate to its programs of study, subject to the approval of \nGFC (e.g. interview, audition, portfolio, etc.) \nThe admission requirements for any Faculty will be those approved by \nGFC as set forth in the current edition of the University Calendar. In \naddition to the admission requirements, selection criteria for quota \nprograms, where they exist, will also be published in the current edition \nof the University Calendar. \nItem 5: page 3\nItem No. 5A - F \nGFC ACADEMIC STANDARDS COMMITTEE \nFor the Meeting of September 15, 2016 \nThe responsibility for admission decisions will be vested in the Faculty \nAdmission Committees or in the Deans of the respective Faculties, as \nthe councils of such Faculties will determine.” \n4.  UAPPOL Admissions Procedure: \n“PROCEDURE \n1. EFFECTIVE DATE OF CHANGES TO ADMISSION REGULATIONS \nFollowing approval by GFC: \na. Where changes to admission regulations may disadvantage students \nin the current admission cycle, normally implementation will be effective \nafter the change has been published in the University Calendar for one \nfull year (i.e., effective the second year that the information is published \nin the University Calendar). \nFor example, a change approved in May 2005 would be first published in \nthe 2006-2007 University Calendar in March 2006. Therefore the \nstatement cannot come into effect until September 2007 (affecting \napplicants who apply for the September 2007 term beginning July \n2006).” \nb. Where changes to admission regulations are deemed by the \napproving body to be ‘advantageous to students’, normally the date of \nimplementation will be effective immediately or at the next available \nintake for the admitting Faculty.” \n5.  PSLA: The PSLA gives Faculty Councils the authority to “determine \nthe conditions under which a student must withdraw from or may \ncontinue the student’s program of studies in a faculty” (Section 29(1)(d)). \n6. UAPPOL Academic Standing Policy:  “All current academic \nstanding regulations, including academic standing categories, University \ngraduating standards and requirements for all individual programs will be \nthose prescribed by Faculty Councils and GFC as set forth in the \nUniversity Calendar.” \n7. UAPPOL Academic Standing Regulations Procedures: “All \nproposed new academic standing regulations and changes to existing \nacademic standing regulations will be submitted by the Faculties or the \nAdministration to the Provost and Vice-President (Academic). Faculties \nwill also submit to the Provost and Vice-President (Academic) any \nproposed changes to the use and/or computation of averages relating to \nacademic standing, including promotion and graduation. \nIf the Provost and Vice-President (Academic) determines the proposal to \nbe in good order, the proposal will be introduced to the appropriate \nUniversity governance process(es). In considering these proposals, \ngovernance bodies will consult as necessary with the Faculties and with \nother individuals and offices. \nNormally, changes become effective once they are approved by GFC or \nits delegate and are published in the University Calendar.” \nItem 5: page 4\nItem No. 5A - F \nGFC ACADEMIC STANDARDS COMMITTEE \nFor the Meeting of September 15, 2016 \nAttachments  \n1.

In general, we wish to maintain high standards, and plan in practice in \ngiving strong preference to students with high scores.  However, because ours is a small program, it is \nunusually susceptible to random fluctuations in the size of our applicant pool, and hence in order to \nmaintain a viable set of graduate course offerings each year, we require the flexibility to accept any student \nwho meets FGSR’s standards for admission. \nApproval Route:  Arts Faculty Council May 25, 2016 \nItem 5: page 12\nFACULTY OF MEDICINE AND DENTISTRY \nCALENDAR ENTRY \nEffective Fall Session 2016-2017 \nJune 3, 2016 \nCURRENT PROPOSED \nDDS Advanced Placement Program \nFor detailed application and program information please \nvisit www.dentistry.ualberta.ca. \nLimitation of Enrolment: Enrolment is limited. \nBecause the number of candidates who meet the \nminimum requirements for admission far exceeds the \nquota, it should be understood that eligibility does not \nguarantee admission.

Post-Secondary Learning Act (PSLA): The PSLA gives GFC \nresponsibility, subject to the authority of the Board of Governors, over \nacademic affairs. Further, the PSLA gives the Board of Governors \nauthority over certain admission requirements and rules respecting \nenrolment. The Board has delegated its authority over admissions \nrequirements and rules respecting enrolment to GFC and GFC ASC. \n(Sections 26(1), 60(1)(c) and (d)). \n2. GFC Academic Standards Committee (ASC) Terms of Reference \n(3. Mandate of the Committee): \n“G. Certificates (All Faculties): Approval Route \nGFC delegated to ASC the authority to approve proposals for the \nestablishment of and termination of credit and non-credit certificates, \nregardless of the proposing academic unit. Where additional funding \nand/or space is required to support the offering of the proposed \ncertificate and/or if, in the opinion of the Provost and Vice-President \n(Academic) (or delegate), the certificate requires Government approval, \nASC would provide a recommendation on the (proposed) initiative to the \nGFC Academic Planning Committee (APC).” \n3. PSLA: The PSLA gives Faculty Councils power to “provide for the \nadmission of students to the faculty” (29(1)(c)). \n4. UAPPOL Admissions Policy: “Admission to the University of Alberta \nis based on documented academic criteria established by individual \nFaculties and approved by GFC. This criteria may be defined in areas \nsuch as subject requirements, minimum entrance averages, and \nlanguage proficiency requirements. In addition to academic requirements \nfor admission, GFC authorizes each Faculty to establish such other \nreasonable criteria for admission of applicants as the Faculty may \nconsider appropriate to its programs of study, subject to the approval of \nGFC (e.g. interview, audition, portfolio, etc.). \nThe admission requirements for any Faculty will be those approved by \nGFC as set forth in the current edition of the University Calendar. In \naddition to the admission requirements, selection criteria for quota \nprograms, where they exist, will also be published in the current edition \nof the University Calendar. The responsibility for admission decisions will \nbe vested in the Faculty Admission Committees or in the Deans of the \nrespective Faculties, as the councils of such Faculties will determine.” \n5. UAPPOL Admissions Procedure: \n“PROCEDURE \nItem 6 - page 3\nItem No. 6 \nGFC ACADEMIC STANDARDS COMMITTEE \nFor the Meeting of September 15, 2016 \n1. EFFECTIVE DATE OF CHANGES TO ADMISSION REGULATIONS \nFollowing approval by GFC: \na. Where changes to admission regulations may disadvantage \nstudents in the current admission cycle, normally implementation will be \neffective after the change has been published in the University Calendar \nfor one full year (I.e., effective the second year that the information is \npublished in the University Calendar). For example, a change approved \nin May 2005 would be first published in the 2006-2007 University \nCalendar in March 2006. Therefore the statement cannot come into \neffect until September 2007 (affecting applicants who apply for the \nSeptember 2007 term beginning July 2006). \nb. Where changes to admission regulations are deemed by the \napproving body to be ‘advantageous to students’, normally the date of \nimplementation will be effective immediately or at the next available \nintake for the admitting Faculty.” \n6. PSLA: The PSLA gives Faculty Councils the authority to “determine \nthe conditions under which a student must withdraw from or may \ncontinue the student’s program of studies in a faculty” (Section 29(1)(d)). \n7. UAPPOL Academic Standing Policy: “All current academic standing  \nregulations, including academic standing categories, University \ngraduating standards and requirements for all individual programs will be \nthose prescribed by Faculty Councils and GFC as set forth in the \nUniversity Calendar.” \n8. UAPPOL Academic Standing Regulations Procedures: “All \nproposed new academic standing regulations and changes to existing \nacademic standing regulations will be submitted by the Faculties or the \nAdministration to the Provost and Vice-President (Academic). Faculties \nwill also submit to the Provost and Vice-President (Academic) any \nproposed changes to the use and/or computation of averages relating to \nacademic standing, including promotion and graduation. \nIf the Provost and Vice-President (Academic) determines the proposal to \nbe in good order, the proposal will be introduced to the appropriate \nUniversity governance process(es). In considering these proposals, \ngovernance bodies will consult as necessary with the Faculties and with \nother individuals and offices. \nNormally, changes become effective once they are approved by GFC or \nits delegate and are published in the University Calendar.” \nAttachments (each to be numbered 1 - <>) \n1.

Include \ncurriculum content, target student \ngroup, target employment, further \neducation options, etc.  \n This program is intended to foster the characteristics of leadership, which we \ndefine as “a process of social influence, which maximizes the efforts of \nothers, towards the achievement of a goal” (Kevin Kruse, Forbes Magazine, \n2013-04-09) and “the desire, ability, and commitment to the uplifting of the \nwhole people” (after H. M. Tory, first president of the University of \nAlberta). Students will take a structured package of courses designed to \ndevelop their ability to take a global, interdisciplinary perspective, to give them \npractice in putting their learning to use in practical projects, to cultivate their \nability to work with others, to adapt their choice of values, directions, and goals, \nand to foster a sense of community engagement and global citizenship. \n A three-stage curriculum prepares students step-by-step for independence, \ninculcating core skills at each level: \n1. Interdisciplinarity, Depth & Breadth of Knowledge, Research, and \nLeadership: There are two required courses: INT D 2xx Scientific and \nHuman Aspects of Global Issues and  INT D 2xx Studies in Leadership. In \nINT D 2xx Scientific and Human Aspects of Global Issues students learn to \nconsider real-world problems from an interdisciplinary perspective. The \ncourse is designed around problem-based learning. In INT D 2xx Studies in \nLeadership students gain a deep understanding of various styles, objectives \nand cultures of leadership. \nItem 6 - page 5\nmailto:Rebecca.Nagel@ualberta.ca\nmailto:Glen.Loppnow@ualberta.ca\n2. Communication, Collaboration, Engagement & Advocacy, Implementation: \nStudents learn both the theory and practice of teamwork and leadership as \nthey work together on practical projects aimed at solving real-world \nproblems in courses such as SCI 299 Science Citizenship, CSL 350 \nSelected Topics in Community Service-Learning, CSL 370 Topics in \nCommunity Issues, and courses in Arts and Science with a significant CSL \ncomponent. \n3. Independence, Investigation, & Initiative: For the capstone experience \nstudents undertake mentored and their own self-guided projects, supported \nby cohort seminars in which the sharing of ideas with peers spurs new \nthoughts and ideas. Two new courses are proposed: INT D 45X Peer \nMentorship: Learning to Lead in Teaching and INT D 45X Individual \nLeadership Practicum in Arts and Science. CSL 480 Individual Study in \nCommunity Service-Learning would also be appropriate for this \nrequirement. \n Target student group: The certificate will be open to all students, but since this \nis a program that can start early in a student’s studies, we also think it would be \nattractive to potential students in high schools. \n Target employment: The certificate will foster skills essential for leadership \nroles in all sectors of society; private, public, voluntary as well as the academic \nsectors.  \n Further educational options: Successful certificate graduates could pursue \ngraduate studies in almost any discipline. Successful certificate students could \nalso potentially enhance their leadership experience within the PLLC and/or \nextra-curricular activities. \nSection B: Rationale, Implications and Impact  \nRationale for Introduction of \nCertificate \nOutline the rationale for the \nproposed embedded credit \ncertificate and provide supporting \ndata if applicable – e.g. Results of \nstudent or economic demand \nanalyses; consultation with wider \ncommunity, etc.   \nIn a world where our biggest challenges are too complex to be solved by any single \ndiscipline, our future leaders must be able to speak the languages of different \ndisciplines, so as to be best positioned to draw on the insights of all. It is for this \nreason that the Faculties of Arts and of Science are working together to build a \nprogram that allows their students to understand different ways of leading through \ncurricular and practical experiences offered by both faculties. As the largest \nundergraduate faculties, with a broad range of respected academic programs, we are \nwell positioned to open students’ eyes to as many perspectives as possible. \nIn order to achieve our vision of leadership, we aim at a set of core learning \noutcomes or competencies that our students will acquire through the program in an \nintegrated fashion. These are designed to align with the values we see as central to \nleadership, as follows: \n Communication: Leaders should be able to transmit their ideas and vision to a \nbroader audience, and help each member of a group understand their role in its \ntask. Therefore, we will foster skills of oral and written communication through \nseminar and public presentations, intensive written assignments, and reports on \nresearch projects. \n Collaboration: Leaders should be able to work with others – and to facilitate \nsuch cooperation among large groups. Therefore, we will foster teamwork skills \nthrough mentored individual and group projects. Furthermore, we will develop \nstudents’ ability to understand the problems of others by having them work \nwith community and business partners to tailor solutions to the problems these \nItem 6 - page 6\npartners face. \n Broad Perspectives: Leaders should not be too narrowly focused; they should \nbe able to take a global view and have at least a general understanding of the \nway different outlooks would interpret and tackle various problems. Therefore, \nwe will develop students’ interdisciplinary skills: by working in both Arts and \nScience, they will come to understand how other disciplines would formulate \nand interpret problems in ways that illuminate a range of aspects, and they will \npractice putting together these perspectives in a coherent overall view. \n Depth of Understanding: A leader is not content to make decisions on a \nsuperficial knowledge of the situation: The University of Alberta has a strong \ntradition of emphasizing interpretation based on evidence, and our students will \nappreciate why this is important. Students will learn to interpret and understand \ndata – to see what it really means, so their judgements are well informed. They \nwill learn to appreciate the diversity of evidence as well as the limitations of \nvarious methods and forms of analysis. Through involvement in the practice of \nresearch, they will learn how knowledge is formed, and will know how to go \nabout investigating things for themselves. \n Engagement & Advocacy: Today’s leaders should not seek to bend others to \ntheir will, but instead see themselves as facilitators, helping others come \ntogether and find their own voice. Leadership and advocacy involve ethical and \nmoral choices, as well as the ability to adapt others’ ways of thinking to these \nchoices in order to benefit society.  During their Scientific and Human Aspects \nof Global Issues courses, students will write argumentative papers in which they \nlearn to state a problem, present and evaluate a range of solutions, and advocate \non rational and ethical grounds for the one they see as best.  Students will also \nencounter engagement and advocacy examples in their experiential components \nthroughout the certificate program. \n Autonomy & Initiative: Leaders do not sit back waiting to be told what to do: \nour students should take the initiative in finding the issues that need addressing. \nTherefore, our program is designed to foster traits of self-guided activity. In the \nfirst two stages of our curriculum, students will be prepared gradually for an \nindependent project in the final stages of their undergraduate degree. In this \nproject, they will take the lead in identifying a problem, finding possible \nsources to tackle it, and coming up with practical solutions in collaboration with \npartners.  \n Responsibility: Leaders are aware of their duties to others: their role is to \nstrengthen the community and to help everyone play a full role in it. To this \nend, we will develop students’ skills in helping others maximise their potential \nthrough peer mentorship and engagement with partners in their experiential \ncomponents. \n Putting Ideas in Practice: Visions may be inspirational, but they need \nimplementation; a leader should be able to translate words into deeds. To this \nend, we will foster skills of project planning, in which students learn to set \nachievable goals and map the best route to their end. Through engaged learning \nactivities, they will come to appreciate the practical difficulties in realizing a \nsolution, and will gain experience in dealing with unexpected obstacles.  The \ncertificate program is scaffolded such that students gain progressive experience \nin project planning throughout. \nReal-world problems require the ability to draw on the best insights of multiple \nItem 6 - page 7\nperspectives, and our students’ final project mirrors that: our interdisciplinary, multi-\nfaculty program is what is necessary to prepare them for such a task. The importance \nof this approach is reflected in recent research into the needs of the job market. A \nrange of surveys of employers indicate the demand for graduates who exhibit the \ncore competencies fostered by our program: \n A Sept 2012 survey for the Chronicle of Higher Education found that business \nleaders called for students able to think globally in order to solve problems; \nthey criticized courses that focused on developing a narrow set of job-specific \nskills at the cost of broader thinking and a sense of ethics. \n A recent survey by Hart Research Associates found that North American \nemployers placed exceptionally high value on the ability to think critically, and \nwanted students more capable of solving complex problems. In addition, 75% \nof employers particularly sought students with a greater sense of moral \nreasoning. \nVision and Academic Plan \nHow does the proposed program \nconnect to the University’s vision? \nHow does the program further the \nUniversity’s Academic Plan?  \nIn a diverse and ever-changing world, it is impossible that one person’s perspective \ncould provide all the answers to the problems we face. The role of a leader, \ntherefore, is to help everyone achieve their full potential and give voice to their \nviews, so as to bring together the contributions of the brightest and the best for the \ngood of all. Such a leader would have a broad trans-disciplinary range of knowledge \nand be capable of understanding things from a number of perspectives: this leader \nwould want to change the world, and would know how to do it. Such leaders would \nbe best able to identify the talents of others and the contributions they might make to \nmeeting the goals of the community at large, but must also be able to take into \naccount moral and ethical concerns, thus serving as role models for the values we \nwish to stand for as a university and as a society.  \nThis is the vision behind the proposed Certificate in Engaged Leadership and \nCitizenship in Arts and Science: we will foster leaders who succeed by connecting \npeople together, developing a discourse to which all can contribute, and who have a \nmoral foundation on which to develop their leadership. Our cross-disciplinary \ncurriculum will not only give them a range of knowledge to solve complex \nproblems; it will help them understand in the first place how different ways of \nthinking formulate and tackle problems. We will give students a global perspective \non real problems, to help them understand how alternative perspectives can shed \nnew light on hitherto-unseen depths of an issue. Our courses will be heavily \nintegrated with engaged learning approaches: not only will our young leaders put \ntheir academic knowledge into direct practice, they will also develop a sense of \ncitizenship and responsibility to others. Through a staged program, we will help \nstudents grow by broadening their perspectives and preparing them to take charge of \ntheir own independent projects: they will leave us fully prepared to take a central \nrole in their communities. \nThe proposed certificate is closely aligned on several points with the new \nInstitutional Strategic Plan, For the Public Good, approved by the Board of \nGovernors on June 17, 2016: \n Objective 7: Increase graduate and undergraduate students’ access to and \nparticipation in a broad range of curricular experiential learning \nopportunities that are well-integrated with program goals and enrich their \nItem 6 - page 8\nacademic experience. \n Strategy i.: Increase students’ experiential learning through mutually \nbeneficial engagement with community, industry, professional, and \ngovernment organizations locally, nationally, and internationally. \n Objective 8: Create and facilitate co-curricular and extracurricular learning \nexperiences for undergraduate and graduate students that enable their self-\ndiscovery and give them the skills to use their talents, creativity, and \ncuriosity to contribute as future citizens and leaders. \n Strategy iv.: Expand access to leadership development programs for \nundergraduate and graduate students, such as the Peter Lougheed \nLeadership College.  \nResource Implications \nIdentify the resource implications \nof the proposed embedded credit \ncertificate. Identify if resources are \nbeing re-allocated to or from other \nareas, and outline the implications \nof this re-allocation.   \n The certificate includes four new courses, Scientific and Human Aspects of \nGlobal Issues, Studies in Leadership, Peer Mentorship: Learning to Lead, and \nIndividual Leadership Practicum in Arts and Science (see below). We anticipate \noffering two to four Leadership certificate-related courses per year to ensure that \nstudents have availability of course offerings to complete the certificate. Each \nsection will require a central coordinator or instructor, as well as TA support for \ndiscussion sections.  In addition, it is anticipated that advising students may \nrequire resources. \n A newly created faculty position has been filled in Psychology to handle two of \nthese new teaching assignments.  Additional existing resources from the \nFaculties of Arts and Sciences will be used for the other new courses. \n Apart from these three new courses, the certificate is designed to draw as much \nas possible on existing courses. The Individual Leadership Practicum in Arts \nand Science course chiefly require oversight rather than full course instruction: \nthey will entail the level of workload normally expected of a committee \nassignment, and could be staffed accordingly. \n We have an existing TLEF grant to explore the development and \nimplementation of interdisciplinary connections between the Faculties of Arts \nand Science, including this leadership certificate. \n Some funding for course releases to facilitate new course development will be \nprovided by the Faculty of Science. \nEnrolment \nOutline the expected enrolment for \nthe embedded credit certificate and \nany potential impacts on course \nofferings. \n We expect approximately 200 enrolees at any one moment for the certificate.  \nThese 200 enrolees will be distributed across multiple years of the certificate. \n Our introductory new course (Scientific and Human Aspects of Global Issues) \nwill consist of a single section capped at 80-200 students, and will serve as the \ngateway to the program; it will therefore be open to students not yet enrolled in \nthe Certificate program.  The enrollment cap will serve as a de facto enrollment \nmanagement system without requiring the human resources associated with \nadmission and advising. \n The other introductory new course (Studies in Leadership) will also consist of a \nsingle section capped at 80-200 students.  This course will provide a leadership \nopportunity for all students and will hopefully provide a connection to PLLC. \n   Because the courses are or will be all cross-listed in both Faculties of Arts and \nScience, this certificate will be head-count neutral in terms of enrolments in \neach Faculty’s courses. \nImplications of Introduction of \nthe Credit Certificate \nIdentify the implications of the \n We do not anticipate any negative side effects for other programs, either here or \nat other institutions. Both the provost’s office and the leads of the PLLC have \nexpressed support for this initiative, and our certificate might complement \nItem 6 - page 9\nproposed embedded credit \ncertificate for the system. For \nexample, will it affect other \nprograms at the U of A, programs at \nother institutions, etc.?  \naspects covered as part of the PLLC initiative.  \n Positive implications include attracting students with an interest in leadership: \nstudies (e.g. Singell & Tang, 2012) indicated that the addition of programs \noriented towards self-identified high-achievers would ‘improve the overall \nability of a large public university to compete for high-performing students, \nparticularly those from out of state.’  \n By embedding a structured mentorship practicum, students will have \nopportunities to apply and strengthen the skills and attributes learned in the two \nfoundational courses. Students will primarily mentor in courses in their own \nFaculty, thus adding peer support in junior courses, while enhancing interaction \nbetween students at different levels. Several peer mentorship opportunities will \nbe provided in the two foundational courses, and will also be provided in other \nsettings in accordance with opportunities within each Faculty.  \nConsultation \nDescribe any consultation and/or \npotential impacts on service units of \nthe University, including the Office \nof the Registrar and Student \nAwards, Academic Information and \nCommunication Technologies \n(AICT), Library Administration, \nFacilities and Operations, Student \nServices, etc.  \n Since 2012, the Arts & Science Task Force has been looking at ways to \ncollaborate in providing leadership opportunities and credentials to students in \nboth Faculties. The Task Force has included representatives from Community \nService-Learning, from Library Administration, from both Faculties, and from \nundergraduate groups representing students in Science and Arts, as well as the \nUniversity of Alberta Students’ Union. In addition, we have consulted with high \nschool principals through the College of Alberta School Superintendents, who \nexpressed great interest as well. \n Faculty of Science Associate Chairs Undergraduate Council – February 13, \nMarch 13, April 10, 2015 and December 18, 2015 \n Faculty of Science Chairs Council – March 26, 2015, October 22, 2015 and \nDecember 17, 2015 \n Faculty of Science Council – May 21, 2015 \n Faculty of Arts Dean’s Executive Committee – February 3, 2015 and January 5, \n2016 \n Faculty of Arts, Academic Affairs Committee—January 27, 2016 and March 30, \n2016 \n Arts Executive—May 12, 2015 \n Arts Faculty Council—May 25, 2016 \nAppendices \nAppendix A – curriculum and \nprogram structure \nList course names, numbers, and \ndescriptions. Indicate if the courses \nare new or existing. Include draft \ncontent for the University Calendar. \nOur program provides a structured development of core skills in three stages: the \nobject is to prepare students to undertake an independent, self-guided project in their \nfinal year that requires them to draw on a range of disciplines in addressing concrete \nproblems. Underpinning the entire certificate, we envisage a strong cohort \nexperience that brings together students from different disciplines and backgrounds \nthroughout the course. We will encourage our young leaders to share their ideas and \ninsights with peers whose work might differ widely from their own. This exposure \nto other perspectives will keep their minds open to new and exciting ideas that might \ninform their own work – as well as instilling a strong sense of community and \ncollaboration, building friendships that will last them a lifetime. \nCourse descriptions are attached at the end of this proposal. \nThe certificate is comprised of: \nItem 6 - page 10\n INT D 240  Scientific and Human Aspects of Global Issues (*3, required) \n INT D 241 Studies in Leadership (*3, required) \n Group Experiential Leadership Component (*3, required): choice of SCI 299 \nScience Citizenship,  CSL 350 Selected Topics in Community Service-\nLearning, CSL 370 Topics in Community Issues, or certain courses in Arts and \nScience with a CSL component.

Where additional funding \nand/or space is required to support the offering of the proposed \ncertificate and/or if, in the opinion of the Provost and Vice-President \n(Academic) (or delegate), the certificate requires Government approval, \nASC would provide a recommendation on the (proposed) initiative to the \nGFC Academic Planning Committee (APC).” \n3. PSLA: The PSLA gives Faculty Councils power to “provide for the \nadmission of students to the faculty” (29(1)(c)). \n4. UAPPOL Admissions Policy:  \n“Admission to the University of Alberta is based on documented \nacademic criteria established by individual Faculties and approved by \nGFC. This criteria may be defined in areas such as subject \nrequirements, minimum entrance averages, and language proficiency \nrequirements. In addition to academic requirements for admission, GFC \nauthorizes each Faculty to establish such other reasonable criteria for \nadmission of applicants as the Faculty may consider appropriate to its \nprograms of study, subject to the approval of GFC (e.g. interview, \naudition, portfolio, etc.). \nThe admission requirements for any Faculty will be those approved by \nGFC as set forth in the current edition of the University Calendar. In \naddition to the admission requirements, selection criteria for quota \nprograms, where they exist, will also be published in the current edition \nof the University Calendar. The responsibility for admission decisions will \nbe vested in the Faculty Admission Committees or in the Deans of the \nrespective Faculties, as the councils of such Faculties will determine.” \n5. UAPPOL Admissions Procedure: \n“PROCEDURE \n1. EFFECTIVE DATE OF CHANGES TO ADMISSION REGULATIONS \nFollowing approval by GFC: \na. Where changes to admission regulations may disadvantage \nstudents in the current admission cycle, normally implementation will be \neffective after the change has been published in the University Calendar \nfor one full year (I.e., effective the second year that the information is \npublished in the University Calendar). For example, a change approved \nin May 2005 would be first published in the 2006-2007 University \nCalendar in March 2006. Therefore the statement cannot come into \neffect until September 2007 (affecting applicants who apply for the \nSeptember 2007 term beginning July 2006). \nb. Where changes to admission regulations are deemed by the \napproving body to be ‘advantageous to students’, normally the date of \nimplementation will be effective immediately or at the next available \nintake for the admitting Faculty.” \n6. PSLA: The PSLA gives Faculty Councils the authority to “determine \nthe conditions under which a student must withdraw from or may \ncontinue the student’s program of studies in a faculty” (Section 29(1)(d)). \nItem 7 - page 3\nItem No. 7 \nGFC ACADEMIC STANDARDS COMMITTEE \nFor the Meeting of September 15, 2016 \n7. UAPPOL Academic Standing Policy:  \n“All current academic standing regulations, including academic standing \ncategories, University graduating standards and requirements for all \nindividual programs will be those prescribed by Faculty Councils and \nGFC as set forth in the University Calendar.” \n8. UAPPOL Academic Standing Regulations Procedures: \n “All proposed new academic standing regulations and changes to \nexisting academic standing regulations will be submitted by the Faculties \nor the Administration to the Provost and Vice-President (Academic). \nFaculties will also submit to the Provost and Vice-President (Academic) \nany proposed changes to the use and/or computation of averages \nrelating to academic standing, including promotion and graduation. \nIf the Provost and Vice-President (Academic) determines the proposal to \nbe in good order, the proposal will be introduced to the appropriate \nUniversity governance process(es). In considering these proposals, \ngovernance bodies will consult as necessary with the Faculties and with \nother individuals and offices. \nNormally, changes become effective once they are approved by GFC or \nits delegate and are published in the University Calendar.” \nAttachments (each to be numbered 1 - <>) \n1.

(Includes either of the Department of \nPsychology Annual Conferences: Brian Harder Honours Day Conference and Joseph R. Royce \nResearch Conference, or a conference approved by the student's research supervisor, or the \nPsychology Department's Associate Chair for Undergraduate programs). \nProgram Synopsis \nResearch \nCertificate in \nPsychology (Arts) \nDescription: The Research Certificate in Arts (Psychology) will build upon the research-\ncentric courses in Psychology to extend an opportunity to students for recognition of their \nhands-on research skills and experience acquired across the second, third and fourth year of the \nundergraduate program.  These research skills will be honed in a series of research courses as \nstudents progress from guided to independent research experiences.  Two additional courses on \ndesign of psychological experiments (PSYCO 212) and statistics (STAT 252) and an \nadditional  course on research methods at the 300 or 400-level will round out the development \nof unique skills in analysis, data handling, interpretation, practical skills and techniques \npertinent to the student’s chosen area of concentration.   \nTarget Student Group: A Research Certificate in Psychology (Arts) will enable Arts students \nin the Department of Psychology to focus on research skills and experiences and build \nexpertise throughout their undergraduate program.  \nPrerequisite: No prerequisites courses or program approval are required. \nCurriculum content:  Successful completion of *12 in hands-on research in a lab setting.  The \ncourses required to fulfill this requirement will also involve either the completion of an \nHonours thesis, or a minimum of three separate research reports.  This experience provides the \nfoundation for the certificate.  Further required courses introduce students to the methods \nthrough which psychological research is conducted (PSYCO 212) and interpreted (STAT 252, \nand the 300/400 Methods requirement).  Through the hands-on lab experience, students will \nlearn to formulate research questions, develop specific research skills, collect and analyse data, \nand communicate the results. Assessment will be based on assignments, presentations and \nparticipation by the student in research in a professor’s lab. \nItem 7 - page 5\nmailto:glen.loppnow@ualberta.ca\nmailto:cindy.paszkowski@ualberta.ca\n 2 \nPSYCO 396 (*3), 398 (*3), 496 (*3), and 498 (*3) each provide students an opportunity to \nundertake one-term projects, generally, but not necessarily, in a sequence under the \nsupervision of a single professor. The focus of this research experience will be the \ndevelopment of practical research skills and techniques while conducting novel research.  \nAssessment will be based primarily on the development of these skills and, to a lesser extent \nthe production of a journal style research paper.  The alternative combination of PSYCO 300, \n399, 400 & 490, or 309, 390, 409 & 499, allows a comparable experience, but as a two-year \nlong Honours project. \nThree courses, STAT 252 (*3), PSYCO 212 (*3) and *3 from approved methods options at the \n300 and 400-level (PSYCO 356, 402, 410, 411, 413, 414, 415, 431, 471, 476, 482 or other \nadvanced research methods course approved by the Honors Advisor), will provide students \nwith experience in study design, data handling, analysis, and interpretation to complement the \npractical skills and techniques learned in the lab. \nPresentation of research as an oral presentation or poster at an organized conference on or off \ncampus will be required for completion of the research certificate program. This presentation \nrequirement is included in, and fulfilled by the PSYCO 300, 400, 309, 409 courses. Students in \nPSYCO 396, 398, 496, 498 sequence will be required to register in a conference in addition to \ntheir other formal course requirements. \nSection B: Rationale, Implications and Impacts \nRationale for \nIntroduction of \nCertificate \nThe first research certificate in the Department of Psychology was proposed as part of a \nFaculty of Science initiative to offer embedded certificates recognizing independent original \nhands-on research in a lab and/or field setting by undergraduate students. All departments in \nScience were invited to develop individual certificates. Under this initiative the Department of \nPsychology proposed a Research Certificate in Science (Psychology) which was approved at \nASC September 17, 2015 for implementation in Fall 2016. The target student group is \ndescribed in the proposal as students in the Department of Psychology.  \nThere are about 1300 students in Psychology. About 850 of them are in the Faculty of Arts and \nthere was concern that the Arts students might not be attracted to a Research Certificate in \nScience. Therefore the Department of Psychology and the Faculty of Arts are proposing the \nResearch Certificate in Arts (Psychology). There is no difference in the requirements between \nthe two certificates. It is expected that students in Arts will be more likely to choose research \nsupervisors who are appointed to the Faculty of Arts, just as students in Science are more \nlikely to choose supervisors in Science, but there is no requirement that students limit \nthemselves by Faculty.  \nThe Research Certificate in Arts (Psychology) recognizes the value of experiential learning in \na research environment and the particular skill set that an immersive experience instills beyond \nthe bachelor’s degree.  Such a certificate program supports the campus-wide Undergraduate \nResearch Initiative and builds on our strengths as a research- and teaching-intensive institution \nby providing a unique opportunity for undergraduate students to excel in the development of \nresearch skills, “helping to create life changing, transformative experiences” for these students. \nThe Research Certificate in Arts (Psychology) will build upon the current strengths in the \nundergraduate programs in the Department of Psychology by giving students the opportunity \nto engage in a focused research experience while pursuing their program. The certificate will \nreinforce the Department of Psychology’s commitment to excellence in undergraduate research \nand enhancing the training of exceptional leaders. \nThis certificate draws on the success of the many separate courses (PSYCO 299 (*1.5), and \n396, 398, 390, 399, 490, 499, 496 and 498 (all *3) in the Department of Psychology that \nprovide opportunities for students to engage in research. Currently over 100 students \nparticipate in research courses in Psychology each academic year.  \nItem 7 - page 6\n 3 \nThe most common employment for Psychology graduates is in either the education or health \ncare fields.  Their roles in these fields is not at the coal face, delivering lessons to students, or \nmedical care to patients, but in the knowledge economy behind these industries. The best \neducation we can give these students is one centred around the core competencies of data \ncollection, analysis and presentation.  Ideally we would give every student multiple, hands-on, \ngraded experiences with the reality of collecting analyzing and presenting empirical data. In \npractice, we do give this experience to a great many students.  This certificate will serve the \ndual function of providing recognition to those students and serving as an advertisement and \nrecruiting tool for this experience. \nA certificate will provide students with a competitive advantage either in proceeding to \ngraduate work in academia (demonstrating experience and skills of exactly the sort most \nsought by graduate supervisors and scholarship committees), or to careers in the workplace \noutside of academia. \nVision and \nAcademic Plan \nThe Research Certificate in Arts (Psychology) recognizes the values and vision set forth by the \nInstitutional Strategic Plan, For the Public Good.  \nObjective 7: Increase graduate and undergraduate students’ access to and participation in a \nbroad range of curricular experiential learning opportunities that are well-integrated with \nprogram goals and enrich their academic experience. \n Strategy i: Increase students’ experiential learning through mutually beneficial \nengagement with community, industry, professional, and government organizations locally, \nnationally, and internationally. \nObjective 11: Advance the University of Alberta’s reputation for research excellence by \npursuing fundamental and original questions and ideas, pushing the frontiers of knowledge, \ninspiring creative experimentation, driving innovation, and advancing society. \n Strategy i: Encourage and champion achievements in a broad base of fundamental and \napplied research,  scholarship, and creative activities. \nResource \nImplications \nThe proposed certificate matches an approved certificate in the Faculty of Science.  Arts \nstudents are fully able to earn that certificate while completing a BA.  It is not anticipated, \ntherefore, that the establishment of this certificate will lead to a substantial increase in the \nnumber of students taking any courses.  A modest increase in the number of PSYCO 212 and \nSTAT 252 students was anticipated with the introduction of the Science Certificate, but this \nwill not be greatly affected by adding a certificate in Arts. \nAn increase in the numbers of undergraduate students seeking to present at the Department’s \ntwo annual conferences (the Royce Conference and the Brian Harder Honour’s Day \nconference) was also anticipated with the introduction of the Science certificate, but no \nadditional resources are expected to be required. \nDevelopment of the Science certificate involved consultations with Gerda de Vries (Associate \nChair Undergraduate) and David McNeilly (Faculty Service Officer Undergraduate) of Math \nand Stats about potential resource implications of  the STAT 252 requirement:  There were 84 \nPsychology majors enrolled in STAT 252 last Fall/Winter.  STAT 252 is required for \nenrollment in the Psychology Honours program, which accounts for approximately 25% - 30% \nof these.  Many of the remaining students are anticipated to be the pool of students who would \nseek this Certificate, and would add to the numbers enrolling in STAT 252.  Last Fall/Winter \nSTAT 252 enrollments were 61 less than the course cap.  Math and Stats estimate that up to \n100 extra STAT 252 enrollments a year could be accommodated without much difficulty. This \nfar exceeds anticipated increase in demands resulting from these Certificates. \nEnrolment \nThere are currently 47 students enrolled in the Department’s two-year Honours programs. It is \nassumed that all of these students (~25/year) will seek and obtain a Certificate in Research.  In \naddition there are currently between 1000 and 1500 Majors across the various Psychology \nItem 7 - page 7\n 4 \nDepartment programs, and approximately 700 students with a declared Psychology Minor. \nFrom this pool of non-Honours students there were 160 registrations in 4th year lab research \ncourses in the last Fall and current Winter terms (another 15 – 20 typically take such courses \nduring the intersession).  While the undergraduate majors are strongly Arts-biased in our \ndepartment, the Honours students tend to be Science-biased.  Following on from these \nproportions we estimate another 10 to 20 students a year will seek a Research Certificate in \nArts (Psychology). The practical limit to the number of students in this program is set by \nresearch opportunities within the labs of faculty members. \nImplications of \nIntroduction of \nthe Credit \nCertificate \nNo adverse impacts are foreseen from the implementation of this research certificate.  Courses \nrequired toward the certificate should be easily accommodated within existing programs.  \nConsultation  \nConsultation and Governance Route (for the Science Certificate): \nDepartment of Psychology – Fundamental concept articulated and discussed at a \nDepartmental retreat – 25 Aug 2014. \nDepartment of Psychology – Research Certificate discussed by council, creation of \nPSYCOBIOL 396 & 398 approved by council – 24 November 2015 \nDepartment of Psychology – Amended version of Research Certificate discussed and \napproved by Psychology Faculty Council – 6 Feb 2015. \nAssociate Chairs, Undergraduate, Faculty of Science — Approved 13 March 2015 \nScience Chairs, Faculty of Science — Approved 26 March 2015 \nAcademic Standards Committee Subcommittee on Standards — Approved 7 May 2015 \nAcademic Standards Committee — Approved 17 September 2015 \nConsultation and Governance Route (for the Arts Certificate): \n   Dean’s Executive Council — Discussed 13 October  2015 \n   Academic Affairs Committee — Approved 27 January 2016 \n   Arts Executive Committee – Discussed 12 May 2016 \n   Arts Faculty Council — Approved 25 May 2016 \nAcademic Standards Committee Subcommittee on Standards – Discussed 1 September 2016 \nAcademic Standards Committee  \nItem 7 - page 8\nARTS-CCRF-9-00-1 \nFACULTY OF ARTS \nCALENDAR CHANGE REQUEST FORM \nDepartment:  \n   DEADLINE \nImplementation:  NORMAL \n  EARLY (Note: new course offerings only) October 15 * \nType of Change:  Program Regulation March 1* \n  New Course  Course Change April 15* \n  Course Deletion   Editorial April 15  \n*Documentation is required to verify that other units in the Faculty of Arts (or other Faculties) offering similar courses have no objection \nto the proposed new course or course change, and to avoid challenges.

Rationale for suspension (for example, changes in applications, enrolment, employer \ndemand, program obsolescence, etc.).  Comment on the alignment of the proposed change \nwith the institution’s strategic direction and priorities.  If enrolment is a key rationale, \nprovide historical enrolment data. \nThe MEng offered by the Department of Agricultural, Food and Nutritional Sciences \n(AFNS) is a course-based program offered to a small number of students in the field of \nfood science.  It is extremely low enrollment, with only 2 students since 2007.   \nThe Faculty of Engineering has expressed concerns over the offering of this program.  \nNormally, graduate degrees in engineering satisfy the criteria professional engineering \nlicensing through APEGA.  However, this is only true if the degree is from an Engineering \nFaculty with accredited programs.  There is a great deal of concern that having an MEng \noffered by another faculty is confusing to students, the Association of Professional \nEngineers and Geoscientists of Alberta (APEGA), other accreditation bodies, and potential \nemployers. \nThe intention is to terminate the program once the last student has graduated.  There is one \nstudent currently enrolled in the program, who according to program regulations must \ncomplete the degree requirements no later than December 31, 2020.   \nThe suspension (and ultimate termination) of the program is supported by the Faculty of \nAgricultural, Life and Environmental Sciences, the Faculty of Engineering, the Department \nof AFNS and APEGA. \n2. Anticipated impacts on students and graduates and plans to ameliorate these impacts.  \nDescribe the institution’s plan to teach out active students and stop-outs.  Include evidence \nof consultation with students and a communications plan for informing stopped-out \nstudents of the change. \nItem 8 - page 4\nThere is only 1 student currently registered in the program, who will be given the normal \nmaximum of 6 years to complete the program.  As a result, there will be no impacts on \nstudents. \nQualified prospective students interested in pursuing a course-based masters degree in \nFood Science will be admitted to the MSc program offered by the Department of AFNS, \nwhich is the typical program of choice for the vast majority of such students already. \nThere is no risk that students previously enrolled will return expecting to finish their \ndegree. \nThere are no expected impacts on graduates of the program. \n3. Identify anticipated impacts on external stakeholders (e.g. employers, professional/ \nregulatory organizations, other post-secondary institutions) and provide evidence of \nconsultation. \nAs the MEng offered by the Department of AFNS is not accredited by APEGA, there will \nbe no external impacts.  In fact, it will ensure that employers and accreditation bodies are \nnot confused by the credential. \nThe suspension (and ultimate termination) of the program is supported by the Faculty of \nEngineering and APEGA. \n4. Identify anticipated impacts on institutional operations and resources (e.g. operating \nbudget, staffing, student services, information technology, library, classroom and lab \nspace).  Discuss plans for the reallocation of any resources freed up by the proposed \nsuspension.   \nThere are no anticipated impacts on institutional operations and resources. \nB:  Reactivation \n1. Rationale for reactivation (for example, increased employer demand, student demand, new \nfunding sources, etc.).  Comment on the alignment of the proposed change with the \ninstitution’s strategic direction and priorities. \n2. Identify anticipated impacts on institutional operations and resources (e.g. operating \nbudget, staffing, student services, information technology, library, and classroom and lab \nspace). \n3.

The General \nAcademic Standing Requirements have been added to the Calendar with \na minimum cumulative GPA of 3.0 and the allowance of only one failed \ncourse. \nThe Impact of the Proposal is For the admission GPA calculation a solid foundation in anatomy is key \nto understanding human movement and the pathological processes that \ncould arise as a result of disease or injury. The advanced anatomy \ncourse covered in the MScPT program is intensive and requires good \nfoundational knowledge for students admitted to the program. To \nfacilitate student success in the MScPT anatomy course, we believe \nrecency of knowledge is important as is a good understanding of the \nmaterial. Therefore we propose a change to require that anatomy be \ncompleted in the previous 5 years. For many students anatomy does not \nfall within their most recent 60 credits, we believe that students may work \nharder to learn and understand the content if it is specifically weighted in \nthe GPA calculation. \nFor the addition of the General Academic Standing Requirements \nsection, FGSR requires programs that have higher minimum cumulative \ngrade point average compared to FGSR’s minimum to provide this in the \ncalendar. \nReplaces/Revises (eg, policies, \nresolutions) \nn/a \nTimeline/Implementation Date Effective immediately \nEstimated Cost and funding \nsource \nn/a \nNext Steps (ie.:  \nItem 10 - page 1\nItem No. 10 \nGFC ACADEMIC STANDARDS COMMITTEE \nFor the Meeting of September 15, 2016 \nCommunications Plan, \nImplementation plans) \nSupplementary Notes and \ncontext \nEngagement and Routing (Include meeting dates) \nParticipation: \n(parties who have seen the \nproposal and in what capacity) \n<For further information see \nthe link posted on \nthe Governance Toolkit section \nStudent Participation Protocol> \nThose who have been informed: \n• Faculty of Graduate Studies and Research Council—September \n14, 2016 \nThose who have been consulted: \n•  \nThose who are actively participating: \n•  \nApproval Route (Governance) \n(including meeting dates) \nRehabilitation Medicine Executive Committee—May 19, 2016 \nGFC Academic Standards Committee—September 15, 2016 \nFinal Approver GFC Academic Standards Committee \nAlignment/Compliance \nAlignment with Guiding \nDocuments \nGOAL: EXPERIENCE…opening doors to a lifetime of learning \nexperiences. \nObjective 10: Expand access to and engagement in the University of \nAlberta for learners engaging in continuing and professional education \nprograms, experiences, and lifelong learning activities. \nStrategy i: Develop continuing and professional education programs that \nconnect the knowledge-mobilization activities of the university’s faculty \nmembers to the needs of diverse learner communities. \nStrategy ii: Create a wide range of opportunities, both in person and \nvirtual, for broad, learning-centred programs for alumni and other \ncommunities of learners engaging in continuing and professional \neducation. \nCompliance with Legislation, \nPolicy and/or Procedure \nRelevant to the Proposal \n(please quote legislation and \ninclude identifying section \nnumbers) \n1.

In \naddition to the admission requirements, selection criteria for quota \nprograms, where they exist, will also be published in the current edition \nof the University Calendar. The responsibility for admission decisions will \nbe vested in the Faculty Admission Committees or in the Deans of the \nrespective Faculties, as the councils of such Faculties will determine.” \n5. UAPPOL Admissions Procedure: \n“PROCEDURE \n1. EFFECTIVE DATE OF CHANGES TO ADMISSION REGULATIONS \nFollowing approval by GFC: \na. Where changes to admission regulations may disadvantage students \nin the current admission cycle, normally implementation will be \neffective after the change has been published in the University \nCalendar for one full year (i.e., effective the second year that the \ninformation is published in the University Calendar). \nFor example, a change approved in May 2005 would be first published in \nthe 2006-2007 University Calendar in March 2006. Therefore the \nstatement cannot come into effect until September 2007 (affecting \napplicants who apply for the September 2007 term beginning July 2006). \nb. Where changes to admission regulations are deemed by the \napproving body to be ‘advantageous to students’, normally the date of \nItem 10 - page 7\nItem No. 10 \nGFC ACADEMIC STANDARDS COMMITTEE \nFor the Meeting of September 15, 2016 \nimplementation will be effective immediately or at the next available \nintake for the admitting Faculty.” \n6. PSLA: The PSLA gives Faculty Councils the authority to “determine \nthe conditions under which a student must withdraw from or may \ncontinue the student’s program of studies in a faculty” (Section 29(1)(d)). \n7. UAPPOL Academic Standing Policy: All current academic standing \nregulations, including academic standing categories, University \ngraduating standards and requirements for all individual programs will be \nthose prescribed by Faculty Councils and GFC as set forth in the \nUniversity Calendar. \n8. UAPPOL Academic Standing Regulations Procedures: \n “All proposed new academic standing regulations and changes to \nexisting academic standing regulations will be submitted by the Faculties \nor the Administration to the Provost and Vice-President (Academic). \nFaculties will also submit to the Provost and Vice-President (Academic) \nany proposed changes to the use and/or computation of averages \nrelating to academic standing, including promotion and graduation. \nIf the Provost and Vice-President (Academic) determines the proposal to \nbe in good order, the proposal will be introduced to the appropriate \nUniversity governance process(es). In considering these proposals, \ngovernance bodies will consult as necessary with the Faculties and with \nother individuals and offices. \nNormally, changes become effective once they are approved by GFC or \nits delegate and are published in the University Calendar.” \nAttachments (each to be numbered 1) \n1.

To be \nincorporated into a master’s degree the student \nmust indicate the request at the time of \napplication to the master’s program.  Except \nwhere otherwise specified by a program, courses \nmust be taken within the five years prior to \nadmission to the master’s program. Certificates \nand/or diplomas from other institutions may also \nbe eligible for laddering providing they do not \nexceed *9 in credits or, for course-based masters \nprograms with more than *24 required credits, \n1/3 of the total credit weight of the program in \ncombination with any individual transfer-credits \nfrom other institutions. In exceptional \ncircumstances and with the explicit prior approval \nof the Faculty of Graduate Studies and \nResearch, up to ½ of the total units of course \nweight for the program may be met through \nladdering of certificates from other institutions in \ncombination with transfer-credits from other \ninstitutions.  \nWhere presenting graded-courses, the student \nmust have obtained individual grades in these \ncourses that are sufficient for credit in the  \nmaster’s program and meet other quality \nassurance considerations of the master’s \nprogram outlined in the program-specific section \nof the calendar at the time of admission.  \nItem 11 - page 5\nDiploma and Certificate \nPrograms \nIt is the responsibility of the department to: \n• verify that all the requirements of the diploma or \ncertificate have been successfully completed \nbefore recommending a student for graduation; \nand \n• submit to the FGSR a Report of Completion \nof Postgraduate Diploma/Post-baccalaureate \nCertificate form. \nThis information must be received and verified by \nthe FGSR before the student's name is placed on the \nconvocation list. \nFailure to meet the deadlines in the Academic \nSchedule will result in a delay in awarding the diploma \nor certificate. \nUniversity of Alberta offers both Embedded and \nFreestanding Certificates.

In this manner the \nUniversity demonstrates its commitment to \nimproving the representativeness of its \ncommunities. \nThe Alberta Human Rights Act, sections \n3 and 11.1, requires that no individual be \ndiscriminated against on the basis of race, \nreligious beliefs, color, gender, physical \ndisability, mental disability, marital status, \nage, ancestry, or place of origin, family status, \nor source of income except where \nthe discrimination can be shown to be \nreasonable and justifiable. The University of \nAlberta recognizes and accepts its \nresponsibility to comply with the requirements \nof this Act in its consideration of students for \nadmission, promotion, and graduation. Of its \nown volition the University of Alberta does not \ndiscriminate on the basis of sexual orientation \nor political belief. \nSubject to the limits set out in the \nAlberta Human Rights Act, the University of \nAlberta affirms its right to determine the \ncriteria by which applicants are accepted into \nthe University community. Individuals seeking \nadmission to or continuance in academic \nprograms must meet the qualifications and \nperformance standards set out by the \nUniversity Equity Statement in Student \nAffairs \nThe University recognizes the diversity of the \nCanadian population and obligation to be \naccessible to all sectors of society. The \nUniversity therefore encourages diversity and \nwelcomes applications from all qualified \npersons including women, members of visible \nminorities, First Nations, Métis, and Inuit, \npersons with disabilities, and sexual and \ngender minorities. The University Calendar \nwill use gender inclusive language when \nreferring to members of the University \nCommunity. This demonstrates the \nUniversity’s commitment to accommodating \nand improving the representativeness of \nits diverse communities. \nThe Alberta Human Rights Act, prohibits \ndiscrimination against any person because \nof race, religious beliefs, colour, \ngender, gender identity, gender expression, \nphysical disability, mental disability, ancestry, \nplace of origin, marital status, source of \nincome, family status or sexual \norientation, except where the distinction can \nbe shown to be reasonable and justifiable in \nthe circumstances. The University of \nAlberta complies with the Act when it \nconsiders students for admission, promotion, \nand graduation. Of its own volition, the \nUniversity of Alberta does not discriminate on \nthe basis of political belief.  \nSubject to the limits set out in the Alberta \nHuman Rights Act, the University of Alberta \naffirms its right to determine the criteria by \nwhich applicants are accepted into the \nUniversity community.

The requirement for a statement of proposed \nresearch and evidence of contact with supervisory faculty members \nprovides a more focused, structured, collegial, and thoughtful entry into \nthe program than the current \"statement of interests\".

Post-Secondary Learning Act (PSLA): The PSLA gives GFC \nresponsibility, subject to the authority of the Board of Governors, over \nacademic affairs (Section 26(1)). Further, the PSLA gives the Board of \nGovernors authority over certain admission requirements and rules  \nrespecting enrolment (Section 60(1)(c) and (d)). The Board has \ndelegated its authority over admissions requirements and rules \nrespecting enrolment to GFC. GFC has thus established an Academic \nStandards Committee (ASC). \n2.

PSLA: The PSLA gives Faculty Councils power to “provide for the \nadmission of students to the faculty” (29(1)(c)). \n4. UAPPOL Admissions Policy: “Admission to the University of Alberta \nis based on documented academic criteria established by individual \nFaculties and approved by GFC. This criteria may be defined in areas \nsuch as subject requirements, minimum entrance averages, and \nlanguage proficiency requirements. In addition to academic requirements \nfor admission, GFC authorizes each Faculty to establish such other \nreasonable criteria for admission of applicants as the Faculty may \nconsider appropriate to its programs of study, subject to the approval of \nGFC (e.g. interview, audition, portfolio, etc.) \nThe admission requirements for any Faculty will be those approved by \nGFC as set forth in the current edition of the University Calendar. In \naddition to the admission requirements, selection criteria for quota \nprograms, where they exist, will also be published in the current edition \nof the University Calendar. The responsibility for admission decisions will \nbe vested in the Faculty Admission Committees or in the Deans of the \nrespective Faculties, as the councils of such Faculties will determine.” \n5. UAPPOL Admissions Procedure: \n“PROCEDURE \n1. EFFECTIVE DATE OF CHANGES TO ADMISSION REGULATIONS \nFollowing approval by GFC: \na. Where changes to admission regulations may disadvantage students \nin the current admission cycle, normally implementation will be \neffective after the change has been published in the University \nCalendar for one full year (i.e., effective the second year that the \ninformation is published in the University Calendar). \nFor example, a change approved in May 2005 would be first published in \nthe 2006-2007 University Calendar in March 2006. Therefore the \nstatement cannot come into effect until September 2007 (affecting \napplicants who apply for the September 2007 term beginning July 2006). \nAttachments (each to be numbered 1 \n1.
