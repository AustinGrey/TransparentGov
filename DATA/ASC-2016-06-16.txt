The University of Alberta’s policy on bloodborne pathogens is designed to align with Alberta Health Services immunization standards and to limit the possibility of transmission of bloodborne pathogens within the educational setting. Discussion: Mr Zaragoza noted that this proposal stems from the need to revise the University Bloodborne Pathogens Policy to align with current practices in infection control and prevention of bloodborne pathogens. He highlighted changes within the policy including clarification of student responsibilities with regards to medical testing and immunization. He reported that his team worked with various groups to develop a consolidated section which would replace the individual Faculty sections within the University Calendar, and that consultation was broad across the academy during its development. Members discussed methods to protect confidentiality, and suggested a few editorial changes deemed friendly by the Chair.",

            "Description": "Purpose of the Proposal: To provide increased access to graduate education and flexibility for students, laddering is a potential mechanism to allow students to use courses taken in certificates and apply them toward pursuing and completing a master’s degree program. Discussion: The Chair began the discussion by inviting members to comment on whether this proposal should be recommended to General Faculties Council (GFC), or approved by the Committee under delegated authority. Dr Burshtyn added that this is an important consideration at this time, due to the ongoing discussions at GFC about delegated authority. She noted that consultation surrounding this proposal was deliberate, in light of this consideration, and suggested that perhaps GFC could be notified for general awareness. Dr Burshtyn provided a summary of the proposal, adding that the intent of the proposal is to provide more flexible pathways for students who are not ready to commit to a master’s program. She further noted that decisions around the admissability of certificate credit would be made at the program level and that, in all cases, a capstone would be requirement for completion as a registered master’s student.  Members engaged in discussion surrounding the term “laddering”, and members suggested including a clear definition of the term. Members considered, at length, accurate ways to word this specific proposal so that these guidelines are clear to the community, most importantly students and Faculties. As a result, members suggested various editorial changes to the proposal to provide additional clarity.",

To be incorporated into a \nmaster’s degree the student must indicate the \nrequest at the time of application to the master’s \nprogram.  Except where otherwise specified by a \nprogram, courses must be taken within the five \nyears prior to admission to the master’s program. \nCertificates and/or diplomas from other \ninstitutions may also be eligible for laddering \nproviding they do not exceed *9 in credits or, for \ncourse-based masters programs with more than \n*24 required credits, 1/3 of the total credit weight \nof the program in combination with any individual \ntransfer-credits from other institutions. In \nexceptional circumstances and with the explicit \nprior approval of the Faculty of Graduate Studies \nand Research, up to ½ of the total units of course \nweight for the program may be met through \nladdering of certificates from other institutions in \ncombination with transfer-credits from other \ninstitutions.  \nWhere presenting graded-courses, the student \nmust have obtained individual grades in these \ncourses that are sufficient for credit in the  \nmaster’s program and meet other quality \nassurance considerations of the master’s program \noutlined in the program-specific section of the \ncalendar at the time of admission.  \n3 \n…….. \n[…] \nDiploma and Certificate \nPrograms \nIt is the responsibility of the department to: \n• verify that all the requirements of the diploma or \ncertificate have been successfully completed \nbefore recommending a student for graduation; \nand \n• submit to the FGSR a Report of Completion \nof Postgraduate Diploma/Post-baccalaureate \nCertificate form. \nThis information must be received and verified \nby the FGSR before the student's name is placed on \nthe convocation list. \nFailure to meet the deadlines in the Academic \nSchedule will result in a delay in awarding the \ndiploma or certificate. \nUniversity of Alberta offers both Embedded and \nFreestanding Certificates. Graduate students cannot \nreceive an embedded undergraduate certificate as \npart of their program of studies, with an \nundergraduate certificate being one that contains \ncourses primarily at the 300- and 400-level. \nInformation regarding graduate diploma and \ncertificate programs is provided under the \nappropriate departmental listing in §205 below. \nTo receive the master’s degree, the student must \ncomplete the University’s Ethics and Professional \nDevelopment requirements as well as any \nremaining master’s program requirements \nincluding the master’s capping exercise. Other \nmaster’s requirements may be waived if there is \nan explicit exemption in the department’s section \nin the calendar for the master’s program.  \nThe student will pay tuition and associated fees \nfor the time registered in the master’s program, \nbut is exempt from the *24 credit residency \nrequirement in (link). \n[…] \nDiploma and Certificate \nPrograms \nIt is the responsibility of the department to: \n• verify that all the requirements of the diploma or \ncertificate have been successfully completed \nbefore recommending a student for graduation; \nand \n• submit to the FGSR a Report of Completion \nof Postgraduate Diploma/Post-baccalaureate \nCertificate form. \nThis information must be received and verified by \nthe FGSR before the student's name is placed on the \nconvocation list. \nFailure to meet the deadlines in the Academic \nSchedule will result in a delay in awarding the diploma \nor certificate. \nUniversity of Alberta offers both Embedded and \nFreestanding Certificates.
