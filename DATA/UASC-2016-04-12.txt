Discussion: The Chair reported that at the January 25, 2016 meeting of General Faculties Council (GFC), members approved a motion to review the delegation of its authorities to all of its current Standing Committees, and by June 30, 2016 to vote on whether to renew or revise these delegated authorities. In addition, that GFC approved a motion to be guided in the review of the governance and operations of GFC by the June 2013 report “A Reflection on the State of Academic Governance at the University of Alberta”. Ms Brolley added that principles of good governance include the regular review of governance processes and that current GFC delegations to standing committees have undergone incremental changes over time and have not been reviewed as a package in many years. The Chair led members through a thorough review of the Committee mandate and Terms of Reference. During the lengthy ensuing discussion, Committee members made several important observations, including the identification a number of significant items within the Terms of Reference requiring additional review, clarification, and discussion. Overall, however, members felt comfortable with current delegated authorities, recognizing that this work should be completed in a smaller forum of individuals possessing a specialized skill set rather than by full GFC. Members also expressed that this process should be afforded more time and deliberation to ensure that changes are appropriate. Ms Patrick noted that a report reflecting this discussion would be prepared for review by the Provost and Vice-President (Academic) by May 1, 2016, and that a draft copy of the report would be distributed to members for review and feedback. The Chair thanked members for their commentary.",

Authority \nThe Post-Secondary Learning Act gives General Faculties Council (GFC) responsibility, subject to the \nauthority of the Board of Governors, over “academic affairs” (section 26(1)) and “to make rules and \nregulations respecting academic awards” (section 26(1)(m)).  GFC delegates certain of these powers to \nits Undergraduate Awards and Scholarship Committee.  GFC has thus established an Undergraduate \nAwards and Scholarship Committee (GFC UASC), as set out below. \nThe complete wording of the section(s) of the Post-Secondary Learning Act, as referred to above, and \nany other related sections, should be checked in any instance where formal jurisdiction or delegation \nneeds to be determined. \n2. Composition of the Committee \nElected by GFC \nFive members from Categories A1.1 and A1.6 and their counterparts in A1.5 and A1.7 (EXEC 18 NOV \n1996) \nOne academic staff cross-representative from the Academic Standards Committee (ASC) \nTwo undergraduate students \nNon-voting Resource Members \nAssistant Registrar, Student Awards (EXEC 11 JAN 2010) \nDean of Students or delegate (EXEC 10 SEPT 2001) \nSenior Development Officer, Office of Development (EXEC 11 JAN 2010) (EXEC 04 OCT 2010) \n3. Mandate of the Committee \nGFC UASC has delegated authority from GFC to: \n1. approve new undergraduate awards; \n2. approve changes to any undergraduate student award already approved by GFC UASC; \n3. approve the minimum value of a major award for undergraduate students, and to review that \nvalue regularly; \n4. approve the minimum value of an undergraduate award administered by the Student Awards \nOffice, and to review that value regularly; (EXEC 05 MAY 2008) \n5. approve the definition of a full normal course load for purposes of awards where more than \none Faculty is involved; \n6. recommend to the GFC Executive Committee on any new policy or revisions to existing policy \ngoverning awards for undergraduate students; \n7. consider any proposal emanating from any member of the University community for changes \nto GFC undergraduate student awards policy, and where deemed appropriate by GFC UASC, \nrecommend changes to the GFC Executive Committee. \n2 \n4. Committee Procedures \nThe Student Awards Office is responsible for listing on the Awards website all approved awards that \nmeet the minimum value. (EXEC 08 SEP 2003) \n5. Additional Reporting Requirements \nThe GFC Executive Committee requested that the GFC UASC provide for information a copy of the \nundergraduate awards approved by GFC UASC (EXEC April 8, 2002, Minute 97). \nR:\\GO04 General Faculties Council - General\\PRO\\TER\\UND\\Undergraduate-Awards-and-Scholarships-Committee-Amended.doc \nApproved October 4, 2010 (EXEC) \nGFC – Committee Overview Chart \nGeneral Faculties \nCouncil (GFC) \nAcademic Planning \nCommittee (APC) \nAcademic Standards \nCommittee (ASC) \nASC Subcommittee on \nStandards (ASC SOS) \nCommittee on the \nLearning Environment \n(CLE) \nCampus Law Review \nCommittee (CLRC) \nFacilities \nDevelopment \nCommittee (FDC) \nUndergraduate \nAwards and \nScholarship \nCommittee (UASC) \nUniversity Teaching \nAwards Committee \n(UTAC) \nReplenishment \nCommittee \nExecutive Committee \n(and Nominating \nCommittee) \nNotes: \n1. It is difficult to accurately represent in an organizational chart the manner in which business flows through the University of Alberta’s academic governance system. For that reason, those \ninterested in learning more are referred to the appropriate source documents, including the Post-Secondary Learning Act, GFC’s Terms of Reference, the General Terms of Reference for GFC\nStanding Committees, and the individual GFC Standing Committee Terms of Reference for details on roles/responsibilities and delegations of authority.\n2. The GFC Executive Committee has been distinguished in this chart given its central role in setting the Agendas for all GFC meetings.  That said, not all academic business flows up to and is\nconsidered by GFC; in some instances, certain GFC Standing Committees have delegated authority to make final decisions or to recommend directly to the Board of Governors..\n3. The GFC Replenishment Committee’s sole function is to replenish the GFC Executive Committee (which functions, too, as GFC’s Nominating Committee).  As such, nominee slates go directly \nfrom GFC RC to GFC.\nItem 5 - Attachment 3\nPage 1 of 8 \nGFC STANDING COMMITTEE DESCRIPTIONS  \nThe Post-Secondary Learning Act (PSLA) gives General Faculties Council (GFC) responsibility, subject to the \nauthority of the Board of Governors, over \"academic affairs\" (section 26(1)). To carry out its responsibilities, \nGFC has established standing committees and appeal boards and has enacted policies governing the \nreplenishment and operation of those groups.
