To orient members to the committee’s mandate, terms of reference, procedures and to committee member roles and responsibilities. Discussion: Ms Haggarty-France and Ms Brolley provided members with a high level overview of the university’s governance structure. Members were provided with an orientation to GFC’s approved principles of delegated authority and committee composition, and the significance of these documents to the structure and functioning of APC. In addition, the roles and responsibilities of members and procedural rules were reviewed. Finally, the mandate and responsibilities of APC were discussed and the recommendations of the ad hoc committee to revise the terms of reference of the committee were introduced. During the discussion, a question arose regarding a formal mechanism to refer strategic matters to GFC.",

Discussion: Ms Collins indicated that there would be no changes to the process of self-identification which provides data and allows for access to services. She provided a summary of the proposed changes which include a requirement to prove Aboriginal identity in cases where places are reserved for Aboriginal students, eligibility requirements for Métis identity, the removal of the statutory declaration as proof of identity, and an updated appeals mechanism. Ms Collins reported that there was extensive consultation surrounding the proposed changes. All Faculties had been consulted and Faculty-specific changes to the Calendar were approved by relevant Faculty Councils. Dean Andersen reported on the relevance of the shift from proof of Aboriginal ancestry to Aboriginal identity and the importance of a connection to the community. During the discussion, questions arose in regards to the appeal process and how a student might prove connection to the Aboriginal community.",

He noted that this establishment is timely and builds upon strong existing relations with Alberta Health Services. The strategic direction of the centre would be led by an international advisory board. During the discussion, it was suggested that the term “system” applies to many additional disciplines such as computing science, business, and engineering, and that it would be advantageous to include them within the proposal. Dr Young noted that there would be no overlap with the existing Institute of Health Economics but that he would seek collaboration with its members. Members also discussed the importance of financial viability of the centre.",

He added that the university is one of the last in the country to change its name. Following wide consultation with faculty members, staff, students and alumni, a name was identified and approved by Faculty Council earlier this year. He noted that the addition of the word ‘sport’ to the title originated from inside the academy to reflect the Faculty’s expertise in sports related subjects. Dean Mummery indicated that the proposed name would define and differentiate the Faculty on the national and international level.

It is important to \nrecognize that committee orientation must be designed in light of the \nfact that those at-large members who do not sit on GFC may require \nadditional attention. The ad hoc committee recommends that \nItem No. 4 \nGFC ACADEMIC PLANNING COMMITTEE \nFor the Meeting of September 13, 2017 \n orientation and orientation materials should be provided in a number \nof modes and formats, including stand-alone orientation workshops, \nbriefings at meetings, and through widely available written and online \nmaterials. A GFC member handbook or guidebook would be an ideal \nreference tool. In light of the unique character of collegial academic \ngovernance, GFC members should be encouraged to use orientation \nsessions to meet and get to know their fellow members and create \nnetworks which can provide informal support and community building \nopportunities. The following recommendations focus on improving \norientation to prepare GFC and committee members to be informed \nand active participants in academic governance. \nRecommendation: THAT a variety of orientation sessions be offered \nincluding a general orientation to governance (Governance 101), \nfollowed by orientations more specific to GFC and GFC standing \ncommittees, and follow up sessions through the year \nRecommendation: THAT the responsibilities of members be clearly \noutlined in a core GFC document” \nCompliance with Legislation, \nPolicy and/or Procedure \nRelevant to the Proposal \n(please quote legislation and \ninclude identifying section \nnumbers) \n1.

Current Committee Terms of Reference \nPrepared by: University Governance \n1 of 2 \nGENERAL FACULTIES COUNCIL \nPrinciples of Delegation \nPrinciples for General Faculties Council Delegation of Authority \nIntroduction \nGovernance is understood as the process through which an organization defines and achieves \nits mandate, which includes making decisions with regard to the structures, policies, and \npractices of decision-making; the exercise of authority; and the mechanisms of accountability.  \nGeneral Faculties Council (GFC) has employed a structure that relies upon the delegation of its \nprovincially-mandated authorities to its standing committees, individuals on campus and other \ncampus bodies.  Delegation is essential to ensure timely and efficient decision-making in \nsmaller forums with access to appropriate resource people, while allowing GFC to focus on \nsubstantive and strategic issues of broad relevance to the university community.  The following \noffers guidance to this delegation structure and helps maintain accountability, transparency, and \ncollegiality in the academic governance system at the University of Alberta. \nRetained Authority \nGeneral Faculties Council shall pursue major policy and strategic issues that include: \n● significant strategic and policy issues related to the academic affairs of the university;\n● any matter involving the alteration of the mandate, terms of reference, membership, or\nstructure of a GFC standing committee; and\n● those matters that a standing committee, body, or officer holding delegated authority\nfrom GFC considers to be of major strategic significance or long-term impact on the\nuniversity.\nPrinciples \n1. Delegations of authority must be reasonable in scope and appropriate to the character and\ncapacity of the body (e.g. council or committee) or officer receiving the delegated authority. \n2. An officer or body acting with delegated authority is accountable to the body which\ndelegated the authority and must report to that body in a timely and sufficiently detailed\nfashion on actions taken under the delegated authority.\n3. An officer or body is responsible to be alert to situations where, for example, there is\nuncertainty as to whether an item falls within the intended delegation or the significance of\nan issue and the division of opinion on the issue suggest it is prudent to refer the issue or\ndecision to the delegating body for consideration. When there is uncertainty as to whether\nan item falls within the intended delegated authority, or if there is clear division of opinion,\nthe officer or body with delegated authority will refer the item to the body that delegated the\nauthority along with a recommendation.\n4. Delegations should be recorded in written form and curated in a transparent manner.\n2 of 2 \nGENERAL FACULTIES COUNCIL \nPrinciples of Delegation \n 5. A body delegating authority may impose restrictions on that authority -- including restrictions \non the authority to sub-delegate -- so long as the restrictions allow sufficient authority for the \ndelegation to be meaningful. \n6. All delegations of authority should be reviewed at regular intervals (ideally once every three \nyears) to ensure they remain appropriate. \n7. Withdrawal of delegated authority should be considered judiciously based on the best \ninterest of the institution and cannot be done retroactively. \n8. An officer or body is not compelled to exercise delegations. The fact that a delegation is held \ndoes not oblige the officer or body to exercise the delegation if, in the opinion of the \ndelegate, some special or unusual circumstances are involved which make it sensible that \nthe issue should receive consideration at a more senior level. \nApproved by General Faculties Council: April 21, 2017 \n1 of 1 \nGENERAL FACULTIES COUNCIL \nPrinciples of Committee Composition \nPrinciples for General Faculties Council Standing Committee Composition \nIntroduction \nGovernance at the University of Alberta relies upon a structure wherein the General Faculties \nCouncil has delegated many of its provincially-mandated authorities to its standing committees.  \nAs such, the composition of those standing committees is crucial to ensuring that decisions are \nmade in an informed manner that takes into account the breadth of issues, perspectives and \nopinions on campus.  The following principles provide a framework to create committee \ncompositions which are reflective of the membership of GFC and appropriate to the role and \nmandate of those committees.  \nPrinciples \n1. Wherever possible, the majority of elected members of each standing committee should be\ndrawn from the membership of GFC to provide tangible links between GFC and its standing\ncommittees and increase engagement of the greater GFC community.\n2. Wherever possible, the number of elected members of a standing committee should exceed\nthe number of ex-officio members.\n3. The voting status of ex-officio members of standing committees should be consistent with\ntheir voting status on GFC and should extend to their delegates.\n4. Ex-officio members should be included in the membership of a standing committee only\nwhen their portfolio is directly relevant to the mandate and role of the standing committee.\n5. Wherever possible, the Vice-Chair of a standing committee should be elected by the\ncommittee from its elected academic staff members and ideally be a member of GFC.\n6. Standing Committees should be populated with a commitment to diversity and broad\nrepresentation from across the university.\n7. When cross-appointment of members on standing committees is appropriate, this should be\noutlined in the terms of reference of each committee and such members shall have voting\nstatus on both committees.\nApproved by General Faculties Council: April 21, 2017 \n1 of 2 \nGENERAL FACULTIES COUNCIL \nRoles and Responsibilities of Members \nRoles and Responsibilities of Members \nIntroduction \nGeneral Faculties Council (GFC) is the principal academic decision-making body of the \nuniversity. It is established in the Post-Secondary Learning Act (PSLA) and given authority, \nsubject to the Board of Governors, over the academic affairs of the university. \nFor GFC to be successful in fulfilling its terms of reference and meeting its responsibilities to the \nuniversity it depends on the active engagement of its members. GFC has delegated much of its \nauthority for routine matters to standing committees allowing GFC to engage in high level \nstrategic and stewardship policy issues. GFC members have the opportunity to serve on the \nstanding committees that approve matters with the delegated authority from GFC.  \nGFC operates under the principle of collegial academic governance including: \n• A commitment to inclusive and participatory governance decision-making\n• A desire to facilitate meaningful individual-level engagement in governance processes\n• A commitment to openness, transparency, and respectful communication\n• A commitment to responsiveness, respect, and reciprocity between governing bodies\nand between governing bodies and university administration\nRoles and Responsibilities of Members \n1. Understand GFC\n1.1 Members should understand that not all matters under GFC jurisdiction will come\nbefore that body for approval. Some decisions are made at the standing committee \nlevel as GFC has delegated authority to approve and report on actions taken on certain \nmatters.   \n1.2 The university operates in a bicameral governance system. Members should \nunderstand the distinction between the role and responsibilities of GFC and the Board \nof Governors. \n2.

GFC rules are not meant to \nunduly restrict debate or limit opportunities for participation. Their purpose is to facilitate \ninclusive and respectful dialogue, while ensuring efficient decision-making. It is the responsibility \nof the Chair, with the support of GFC, to employ the rules governing general meetings in a \nmanner consistent with these principles. Substantive motions should be handled with \nconsiderable formality, but whenever possible the Chair should deal with matters of procedure \nby general agreement. \nThe following rules and procedures are based on a number of fundamental principles that \nencourage participation and engagement of members. These principles include: \n• A commitment to inclusive and participatory decision-making. \n• A commitment to openness, transparency and respectful communication. \n1.  Procedural Rules  \n1.1  GFC and its standing committees are governed by the procedural rules set out below. \nFor matters not covered by these rules, or by the Post Secondary Learning Act (PSLA) \nreference shall be made to the current edition of Robert's Rules of Order. If this does \nnot provide clear direction regarding a point in question, then the Chair shall decide \nhow to proceed. However, such rulings by the Chair may be overruled via a motion \nsupported by a vote of the majority of those present.  \n1.2  The chairs of GFC and its standing committees will be responsible for guiding \nmeetings of GFC and its standing committees, enforcing rules, and deciding questions \npertaining to those rules. Any decisions of the chair are subject to challenge (see \n10.3). \n1.3 The Chair will not participate actively in debate regarding a motion before GFC without \npassing the role of the Chair to the Vice-Chair for the duration of the debate and the \nsubsequent vote.  \n2. Meetings \n 2.1 GFC and its standing committees shall meet regularly during the academic year, the \nschedule of which will be published on the governance website at least one month \nbefore the beginning of each academic year. GFC meetings will not be scheduled \nduring the period set aside for final examinations or Reading Week, however \ncommittee meetings may occur during this time. \n 2.2 Cancellation - GFC Executive Committee may cancel a meeting of GFC if it \ndetermines that the number and nature of the agenda items make it reasonable to \ndefer consideration, and provided that notice of such cancellation is given to members \nat least one week prior to the date of the meeting. The Chair of a GFC standing \ncommittee may cancel a meeting if the agenda items make it reasonable to defer \n2 of 6 \nGENERAL FACULTIES COUNCIL \nMeeting Procedural Rules   \nconsideration, and provided that notice of such cancellation is given to members as \nearly as possible.  \n 2.3  From time to time, the Chair of GFC may call special meetings of GFC, provided that \nnotice of such meetings is given to members at least one month in advance.  \n 2.4 GFC meetings shall normally be scheduled and planned to end two hours after being \ncalled to order. \n 2.5 Debate on new items of business will not be entertained after GFC has been sitting for \nthree hours.  \n 2.6 No audio or video recording of meetings shall be permitted unless by express authority \nof the Chair. \n3. Open Sessions \n 3.1 Meetings of GFC and its standing committees are normally held in open session, with \nthe exception of those dealing with nominations and adjudication which are always \nheld in closed session. \n 3.2 Subject to the limitations of space and orderly conduct as determined by the chair, \nmembers of the university community and the general public may attend open \nmeetings as observers. Observers may only speak if expressly invited to do so by the \nChair.  \n4. Closed Sessions \n 4.1 From time to time, GFC or its committees may hold meetings or portions of meetings \nas closed meetings; at that point, proceedings will be confidential and all non-\nmembers, except those specifically invited, will be asked to withdraw. \n5.  Questions  \n5.1  If more information than is provided as part of the meeting agenda is required, \ninformation requests may be made of the University Governance office. \n5.2  Questions on an issue within GFC’s jurisdiction may be submitted in writing to the GFC \nSecretary up to six working days before the next GFC meeting to receive a written \nresponse. \n5.3  Every GFC meeting has Question Period as a standing item wherein members may \nraise a question during the time set aside for this item (see 6.5). Procedures for \nQuestion Period are available at governance.ualberta.ca \n5.4  Questions with regard to a specific item on an agenda may be raised during \nconsideration of that item at the GFC meeting. \n6.  Agendas \n 6.1  The agenda of each GFC meeting will be proposed by the GFC Executive Committee \nand approved by GFC. The GFC Executive Committee will ensure that items put \nbefore GFC are complete and ready for discussion and published in advance of the \nmeeting.  \nhttp://www.governance.ualberta.ca/GeneralFacultiesCouncil/%7E/media/Governance/Documents/GO05/GEN/Linked%20Documents%20on%20GFC%20Home%20Page/Question-Period-Excerpt-from-the-2006-GFC-PM.pdf\n3 of 6 \nGENERAL FACULTIES COUNCIL \nMeeting Procedural Rules   \n 6.2 If GFC members want to have an issue debated, they are asked to submit the issue to \nthe GFC Executive Committee. Whenever possible, members wishing to add items to \nthe agenda should contact the Chair or GFC Secretary two weeks in advance of the \nGFC Executive Committee meeting to allow time for the item to be added to the \nagenda. \n 6.3 Should a member wish to add an item to the agenda at a meeting of GFC, a two-thirds \nvote of those present is required; the Chair will then determine where the item appears \non the agenda. In cases where the Chair or GFC Secretary has been informed in \nadvance of a planned request to add a new item, but after the agenda has been \npublished, the proposal shall be circulated to members through the normal means. \n 6.4 When the Agenda is being approved, the Chair will entertain a request to change the \norder of items, for specified reasons.  \n 6.5 Each agenda of GFC and its standing committees will include Question Period of one \nhalf hour in length that may be extended with the approval of members.  \na. Question period is comprised of both written questions and, time permitting, \nquestions from the floor.   \nb. The Chair will rule on whether a question from the floor can be answered \nexpeditiously; if not, it will be referred to the appropriate officer for response at the \nnext meeting.  \n 6.6 Reports from standing committees are included on the GFC agenda for information \nonly. Questions may be asked for clarification, but no debate may take place on such \nitems. \n 6.7 Reports for Information may be moved to the discussion part of the agenda if a \nmember gives two days notice to the GFC Secretary to ensure that an appropriate \nperson is present to answer questions that may arise during discussion.  \n 6.8   Agendas and materials for open session meetings are posted at \ngovernance.ualberta.ca \n7. Quorum  \n 7.1 General Faculties Council -  The quorum for a GFC meeting is one-third of the total \nmembership, except in the months of May through August when the quorum shall be \none-quarter of the total membership.  \n 7.2 GFC Standing Committees – The quorum for standing committee meetings is one-half \nof the voting members or, in the case where this is an even number, one-half plus 1 \nmember.  \n 7.3 Vacancies on committees are not included when establishing quorum. \n 7.4 Maintaining quorum - A duly-called meeting which starts with a quorum present shall \nbe deemed to have a continuing quorum, notwithstanding the departure of voting \nmembers, unless the quorum is challenged by a voting member. In the event of a \nchallenge, the remaining members may choose to adjourn or continue the meeting. In \nhttp://www.governance.ualberta.ca/en/GeneralFacultiesCouncil.aspx\n4 of 6 \nGENERAL FACULTIES COUNCIL \nMeeting Procedural Rules   \nthe event of a decision to continue a meeting without quorum, the minutes shall record \nthis fact and any decisions taken must be ratified at the next meeting.  \n8. Motions \n 8.1 Normally, all motions concerning substantive matters shall be published in the agenda \nmaterials. \n 8.2 All motions must be moved and seconded by members of GFC.  Motions to appoint \nnew members may only be moved and seconded by statutory members of GFC. \n 8.3 Motions pass with a majority vote, except for the following: (1) motions to add an item \nto the agenda require a two-thirds majority of those present; (2) motions to rescind a \nmotion require a two-thirds majority of total members. \n 8.4 To make a motion, a member must be recognized by the Chair. (In the interest of \nclarity and to expedite business, it is advisable to provide a written motion to the GFC \nSecretary). The person making a motion will be invited by the Chair to speak first in \nany ensuing debate. \n 8.5 Amendments to Motions - A member may make a motion to amend the wording – \nand within certain limits the meaning – of a pending motion before the pending motion \nitself is voted upon. The amendment must be germane and cannot be used to \nintroduce a new subject. An amendment is debatable. \n 8.6 Motion to Adjourn - A motion to adjourn is a motion to close the meeting. It must be \nseconded, is not debatable or amendable, and typically requires a simple majority \nvote. During the months of March and April, motions to adjourn require a two-thirds \nmajority if substantive items of business remain on the agenda.  \n 8.7 During the course of a GFC meeting, members may make a Notice of Motion for \ndebate at the next GFC meeting. In such cases GFC Executive will be responsible for \nplacement of the motion on the next GFC agenda. \n9. Motions for Specific Purposes \n 9.1 Motion to Table – Enables the pending question to be laid aside until some future \ntime. The motion cannot be debated. The mover may make a statement regarding \nwhat information they believe would be required to remove the item from the table, and \nthe proposer of the item may make a brief comment on the impact of tabling the \nmotion.  \n 9.2 Motion to Take From the Table – Brings the motion back before GFC and cannot be \ndebated. \n. \n 9.3 Motion to Reconsider an item which was voted upon at the current or the last \nmeeting. If passed, proceedings are restored to the point immediately prior to the vote \nto which it applies. \n 9.4 Motion to Rescind a Motion is only used when a Motion to Reconsider is out of time. \nMotions to Rescind require support of two-thirds of the total membership if no Notice of \nMotion was given, but only a simple majority if Notice was given.  \n5 of 6 \nGENERAL FACULTIES COUNCIL \nMeeting Procedural Rules   \n10. Debate \n 10.1  Normally, a member may not speak for a second time until the Chair is satisfied that all \nmembers wishing to speak for their first time have done so. \n 10.2  A member who has the floor may not normally be interrupted. However, the Chair may \ninterrupt a speaker if the speaker is out of order by using unacceptable language, is \nabusive of other members, or is not speaking to the motion. If the Chair does not do \nso, a member may raise this as a point of order.  \n 10.3  Point of Order - It is the right of any member who notices a breach of the rules of \nCouncil to insist on their enforcement. If the Chair fails to notice such a breach, any \nmember may make the appropriate Point of Order, calling on the Chair for a ruling. A \nPoint of Order does not require a seconder, it is not debatable or amendable, and \ncannot be reconsidered.  \n 10.4  Calling the Question - Upon hearing a member call the question, the Chair will ask \nmembers if they are ready to vote on the motion being discussed. If there appears to \nbe opposition to closing the debate, the Chair may ask for a motion to close debate. If \nseconded, members will then vote on this motion and proceed accordingly.  \n11. Debates without Motions \n11.1  When discussion of an issue and the formal rules pertaining to making motions, \ndebate, and voting seem to be a hindrance to thoughtful discussion, the GFC agenda \ncan allow for a less structured discussion guided by the Chair and the consensus of \nthe members in attendance.  \n12. Attendance  \n 12.1 Delegates – members who serve on GFC or its standing committees by virtue of their \noffice may send a delegate; such delegates shall act with all the rights of membership.  \nThere shall be no alternates for other members. \n 12.2 GFC attendance - If a student misses two consecutive meetings or more than three \nmeetings, the Students’ Union or the Graduate Students’ Association may request that \nthe Chair declare the position vacant. If a faculty representative or a non-student \nappointed member misses two consecutive meetings or more than three meetings in \none academic year without a reason satisfactory to the members of the GFC Executive \nCommittee, the Executive Committee may declare the position vacant.  \n 12.3 Standing committee attendance - If an elected member is absent from three \nconsecutive meetings or is frequently absent without a reason satisfactory to the \nremaining members of the Committee, the Chair shall declare the position vacant.  \n13. Voting  \n 13.1 All members of GFC are charged with the responsibility of examining issues before \nCouncil and voting as they judge fit on such issues. No member of GFC, regardless of \nhow that person gains membership on Council, is an instructed delegate. \n 13.2 Motions shall normally be adopted on a simple majority of members present except to \nadd items to the agenda which requires a two-thirds majority of those present, or for a \nMotion to Rescind which requires a two-thirds majority vote of total membership. \n6 of 6 \nGENERAL FACULTIES COUNCIL \nMeeting Procedural Rules   \n 13.3  An abstention is not considered to be a vote cast.  \n 13.4 The Chair votes only in the instance of a tie. When there is a tie vote, the motion is lost \nif the Chair abstains.  \n 13.5 All members may participate in discussions; only voting members may move, second \nand vote on motions.  \n 13.6 Electronic Votes by Committees – In cases where extensive deliberation is not \nessential to determining a course of action and it is necessary for a business item to \nbe decided before the next scheduled meeting, the Chair and Secretary of a GFC \nstanding committee may hold an electronic vote. The motion will be duly moved and \nseconded and all normal procedures will be followed in conducting the e-mail ballot. \nHowever, upon receiving the item of business and ballot, any committee member may \nrequest that the matter be debated at the next meeting or at a special meeting and the \nvote delayed until after that debate, with the Chair determining the appropriate course \nof action.  \n 13.7 Electronic Votes by GFC – In cases where GFC is the electing body to populate \ncertain selection committees and other bodies, the election process may use e-vote \nmechanisms. \n 13.8 Electronic Approval of Committee Reports by GFC – Reports from the Nominating and \nReplenishment Committees may be distributed electronically to GFC members and are \nconsidered approved by the deadlines indicated on the report subject to receipt of \nadditional nominations.   \n14.

Name of the Proposed Centre or Institute \nCENTRE FOR HEALTH SYSTEM IMPROVEMENT (CHSI) \n3.  Academic Justification for Establishment of a Centre or Institute \n Define the vision and purpose of the proposed unit \nThe activities and outputs of the Centre should contribute to creating a high performing health \nsystem that optimizes equitable access, quality, effectiveness and efficiency by utilizing whole \nsystems thinking to improve health. Its proposed mission is to embed systems thinking into \ninitiatives that generate transformative, evidence based policy options.  \nThe Centre serves the following purposes: \n1. Consolidate existing research in health system improvement in SPH and across UAlberta \n2. Establish SPH and UAlberta as a reputable source of evidence-based advice \n3. Promote and sustain partnerships with external stakeholders in academe, government, non-profits \nand the private sector \n4. Enhance capacity in health services and policy research in SPH and across UAlberta through training \nfellowships, executive programs and continuing education courses \n5. Generate revenue for SPH and UAlberta through contract consultation services \n6. Provide a focus for donor support \n Demonstrate that the proposed Centre/Institute does not duplicate other efforts at the \nUniversity \nThe proposed Centre will strengthen the already extensive existing collaborations across multiple \nfaculties but does not duplicate other efforts since a similar centre does not yet exist on the UAlberta \ncampus.  \nPage 1 of 22\nhttp://www.uappol.ualberta.ca/\n2 \n Document the emerging or established excellence of the group of faculty involved, and \ndescribe how the proposed Centre or Institute will position the University of Alberta as a \nnational and international leader \nIn recent years, numerous international surveys of the performance of health systems, including that \nof the Commonwealth Fund, have demonstrated that Canada is one of the worst performers in the \ncategories of safety, efficiency and timeliness of care.  \nIssues facing health systems in Canada are numerous, complex, and readily visible. Examples include: \n Difficult financial circumstances and both real and perceived threats to the sustainability of \ntheir health systems \n The lack of innovative and collaborative approaches in federal-provincial relationships to help \naddress health care issues  \n Pressing health workforce issues affecting the cost and quality of care – what options are \nfeasible when labour agreements can drive many decisions and limit choice?  \n The rapid pace of technological change, leading to many new and innovative health \ntechnologies that challenge existing priority-setting and decision-making processes within \nhealth systems \n The need to optimize outcomes through stronger community-based care services that \nminimize reliance on the acute care system   \nThese issues are not new, yet they remain, in part because of the complex systems in which health \ncare is funded, financed and delivered.  Traditionally, attempts to resolve them have involved \npredominantly health policy-makers.  However, it is well known that the range of individuals and \nsectors impacted, as well as the intended and unintended outcomes, often extend beyond health.  \nTherefore, solutions based on ‘whole systems thinking’ or ‘systems thinking’ are required. This is an \napproach to problem solving that “views problems as part of a wider, dynamic system”.  Each \nproblem comprises sets of interrelated components within or across systems that, if considered in \nisolation, can lead to problems elsewhere. Systems thinking examines interrelationships among these \ncomponents by incorporating a range of perspectives, conditions, connections and capabilities into a \ndynamic analysis”.  In the case of a health system issue, this means bringing together the public and \nprivate sectors, as well as multiple disciplinary traditions from both health and non-health areas.   \nWhile systems thinking provides opportunities to establish direct links to policy-making, enhance \nprocesses, and improve outcomes, it challenges existing power relations and structures.  Thus, there \nis a need for mechanisms that align perspectives, priorities and policies within and across adaptive \nsystems and an environment which enables their development. \nTherefore, it is proposed that a Centre for Health System Improvement (CHSI) be established within \nthe School of Public Health (SPH), University of Alberta. \nSPH at the University of Alberta is currently the only School in Canada accredited by the Council on \nEducation in Public Health (CEPH). The mission of CEPH is to assure “quality in public health education \nand training to achieve excellence in practice, research and service, through collaboration with \norganizational and community partners.”  \nEven before the establishment of the School of Public Health, a Master of Health Services \nAdministration (MHSA) program was offered by its predecessor in the Faculty of Medicine. Its first \ncohort graduated in 1971. The MHSA has now been supplanted by the MPH in health policy and \nmanagement. Hundreds of MHSA and MPH graduates have served and continue to serve the needs of \nhealth systems across Canada. They include deputy ministers of health, heads of hospitals and health \nregions, chairs of boards and statutory bodies, and senior executives in health organizations in both \nthe public and private sectors. Many of them remain actively linked to the School through alumni \nactivities, teaching in the School’s graduate programs, or participating as adjunct faculty.  \nPage 2 of 22\n3 \nAlso, members of the School’s faculty continue to work with Alberta Health and Alberta Health \nServices on various projects and provide research support and advice to these organizations on both a \nformal and informal basis. As a commitment to its engagement with relevant communities, the SPH \nhas had an Executive-in-Residence for the past 4 years. In addition, the School has built into its faculty \nevaluation process recognition of activities that foster relationships with such communities. With \n“engaged scholarship” as a key expectation, the role of faculty members in policy arenas in Alberta \nand elsewhere has increased significantly.  The existing expertise in the School in disciplines related to \napplied health research and faculty members’ connections with leaders in the health system and \nother academic disciplines in the University provide the basis for establishing a Centre that could \ncollectively and cohesively harness these assets to address health system issues. Specifically, the \nproposed Centre would bring together the research, education and practice knowledge needed from \nmultiple sectors and disciplines to propose solutions that improve health outcomes within a \nsustainable public system. \nThe School continues to be engaged in projects addressing health system issues, whose success relies \non strong, enduring relationships with individuals in the health system.   \nKey members of the proposed centre include: \nDrs. Devidas Menon and Tania Stafinski have been engaged in health systems research for over 15 \nyears.   For over a decade, the School has been home to the Health Technology & Policy Unit (HTPU).  \nThe Unit undertakes assessments of the clinical, economic, social and system implications of \nintroducing new health technologies into health systems through the Alberta Health Technologies \nDecision Process (AHTDP). This involves formal linkages with researchers from the University of \nCalgary and the Institute of Health Economics, as well as senior representatives of AH, AHS, the \nCollege of Physicians and Surgeons of Alberta, the Collage and Association of Registered Nurses of \nAlberta and the Canadian medical industry association, MEDEC.  It also develops innovative methods \nfor health technology assessment (HTA) aimed at addressing issues related to key steps in the HTA \nprocess.  They include horizon scanning and environmental scanning to identify potential \ntechnologies for assessment, priority-setting of technologies for assessment (e.g., value of \ninformation analysis), approaches to determining clinical benefit that reflect patient preferences and \nbroader social values, decision analytic modeling and economic evaluation, incorporation of HTA into \ndecision-making, the design and implementation of alternative funding options that balance access to \npromising technologies with the need to ensure effective and efficient use of limited healthcare \nresources (e.g., managed entry or access with evidence development (AED)), and approaches to the \nreview of companion diagnostics. Research has also been undertaken examining the diffusion of \ntechnologies into health systems across Canada. This work has been funded by the Alberta Heritage \nFoundation for Medical Research, the Government of Alberta and Health Canada.  Prior to joining the \nUniversity of Alberta, Dr. Menon had served as the founding Executive Director of the Canadian \nCoordinating Office for Health Technology Assessment (now the Canadian Agency for Drugs and \nTechnologies in Health) and the CEO of the Institute of Health Economics. \nDrs. Menon and Stafinski have also have an active research program relating to policies relating to the \nintroduction and management of new technologies for managing rare diseases, which have unique \naspects to them. PRISM (Promoting Rare-disease Innovations within Sustainable Mechanisms) is a \nmulti-disciplinary and multi-sectoral collaborative funded by the CIHR and centered at the SPH. The \nresearch team includes health policy researchers, health economists, health law scholars, academic \nclinicians and bioethicists from universities in Canada, the United States, and Europe. Key knowledge \nusers include senior executives from the government so Alberta, Ontario and the federal government. \nThe other non-academic groups that are partners in this project are the rare disease community (the \nCanadian Organization for Rare Disorders) and pharmaceutical company, each with formal linkages \nwithin the group. Research and knowledge translation take place in the areas of innovation and \nPage 3 of 22\n4 \nfinancing, pharmaceutical policy, patient and public engagement, and legal and ethical issues around \nrare diseases. \nDr. Jeff Johnson has been a Canada Research Chair, Killam Professor and University of Alberta \nCentennial Professor. His principal interest has been in diabetes management, at both the population \nand health system levels, including diabetes surveillance and the assessment of the quality and \nefficiency of health care for type 2 diabetes.  He directs the Alliance for Canadian Health Outcomes \nResearch in Diabetes (ACHORD) based in the Alberta Diabetes Institute at the University of Alberta. \nACHORD’s research has been influential in the development of clinical practice guidelines and health \npolicies related to diabetes care, locally, nationally and internationally.  He also leads a productive line \nof research and application of health-related quality of life measurement, including various \napplications in controlled trials, population health, and health care system evaluation.  \nDr. Johnson has a long history of working with national and provincial agencies, both government and \nnon-government, in areas of diabetes and public health policy and research. He was the co-chair of \nthe Scientific Working Group for the National Diabetes Surveillance System (NDSS) from 2005 to 2009, \nadvising the Public Health Agency of Canada on the future direction for the NDSS.  He served as a \nmember of the Expert Committee on Drugs and Therapeutics, advising the Minister of Health on the \nAlberta Drug Benefit List from 2005 until 2015.  He was also actively involved in the implementation \nof the Alberta Diabetes Strategy, where from 2007 to 2012, he led the Alberta Diabetes Surveillance \nSystem (ADSS).  From 2012 to 2014 he was the inaugural Scientific Director for Diabetes, Obesity and \nNutrition Strategic Clinical Network, Alberta Health Services. \nDr. Dean Eurich was previously a CIHR New Investigator and an AHFMR Population Health \nInvestigator, and now holds the Canada Research Chair in Chronic Disease Prevention and \nManagement. He is a Joint Lead, Career Development in Methods & Health Services Research \nplatform for Alberta's Strategy for Patient Oriented Research (SPOR) Support for People and Patient-\nOriented Research and Trials (SUPPORT) Unit. Dr. Eurich’ research has focused largely in the areas of \nclinical epidemiology and health services research, focusing on three core areas - diabetes, heart \nfailure, and community acquired pneumonia. Collectively, these diseases affect a large number of \npatients, are rapidly increasing due to our aging population, and result in significant morbidity and \nmortality, particularly in the elderly. Moreover, these disease states often co-exist within individual \npatients, placing tremendous strain on health care systems due to the high degree of health services \nutilization associated with their management. His research aims to evaluate health outcomes and \nhealth services use in general, with particular interested in knowledge synthesis and evaluation of the \nsafety and effectiveness of drug therapies in real-world settings. Dr. Eurich also continues to explore \nand expand on methodology (i.e., study design and analytic methods) to improve the evaluation of \ninterventions within clinical and large population-based administrative data sets. \nDr. Eurich’s work has been directly translated into policy actions and ultimately to patient care, \nincluding policy changes by the Food and Drug Administration in the US and Health Canada, whereby \nboth governing bodies changed product labels to allow the use of the drug metformin in patients with \ndiabetes & heart failure. This research has been incorporated in all major clinical practice guidelines \nfor the management of diabetes around the world, as well as international heart failure clinical \npractice guidelines.  \nDr. Arto Ohinmaa is professor of health economics and co-Director of the Alberta PROMS and EQ-5D \nSupport Unit (APERSU). APERSU is an intermediary office that connects the EuroQol foundation with \nnon-commercial users of EQ-5D instruments and other patient reported outcome measures (PROMs) \nin the province of Alberta, Canada. Its vision is “to improve decisions by end-users and stakeholders \nabout health and health care in Alberta by promoting, coordinating, and supporting the use of EQ-5D \nand other patient-reported outcome measures for the measurement and valuation of health”. \nPage 4 of 22\nhttp://www.euroqol.org/\n5 \nDr. Ohinmaa’s main research areas include economic evaluation of health care programs, health \nrelated quality of life measurement, health technology assessment, distribution of health and health \ncare costs in the population, economic assessment of health promotion programs, mental health and \nvaccination and connection with health economic studies and policy decisions. His special research \ninterest has been assessment of the telemedicine and telehealth applications. His research has often \nhad a close link to decision making in government and health care organizations. \nRecent strategic faculty recruitment at the Assistant Professor rank in the SPH has brought further \nstrength that will contribute to the evaluation and success of the proposed Centre.  These include Dr. \nMike Paulden, a health economist, and Drs. Stephanie Montesanti and Elaine Hyshka, who add \npolicy analysis and research expertise to the School. \nThe Centre will draw on experts in other faculties on campus, who will be invited to join the centre as \nAcademic Fellows. To date the following have committed to participating: \nDr. Lee Green, Professor and Chair, Department of Family Medicine, Faculty of Medicine and \nDentistry – he is AIHS Translational Chair in Health Care Research, with a focus on primary care; \nDr. Brian Holroyd, Professor and Chair, Department of Emergency Medicine, Faculty of Medicine and \nDentistry, with a specific interest  in the optimal utilization of emergency room services \nDr. Carole Easterbrook, Professor and Canada Research Chair in Knowledge Translation, Faculty of \nNursing, who has research expertise in chronic and elderly care; \nDr. Cheryl Sadowski, Professor, Faculty of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences – who will \ncontribute her expertise in geriatrics, pharmaceutical practice and policies. \nThe School’s emphasis on engagement also places it in an ideal position to contribute to training the \nnext generation of health services researchers. The Canadian Health Services and Policy Research \nAlliance (CHSRPA), established by the Canadian Institutes of Health Research, recently concluded that \nhealth services and policy research doctoral candidates are currently not adequately prepared for a \nmarket that needs them in order to improve our health systems. The CHSPRA has stated that in \nCanada, we need successful training modernization that harnesses the full talents of PhD-trained \nindividuals for continuous health system improvement. As a consequence, the CIHR has launched the \nfirst of a planned sequence of training programs, initially at the post-doctoral level, and subsequently \nto doctoral student. These programs require the very active engagement of, and supervision by, \nhealth system decision-makers in the education of trainees. The School’s existing linkages with \nvarious areas in AH and AHS meet a necessary condition for success in obtaining trainee funding \nthrough these initiatives. We are pleased to announce that the School of Public Health is among 3 \ninstitutions in western Canada and 12 across Canada to be awarded a start-up grant to develop a \npostdoctoral program in partnership with Alberta Health. \nSPH has recently introduced a Fellowship in Health Systems Improvement (FHSI) executive program \nas part of its efforts to create resilient, adaptive leaders who can bring about transformative change. \nThis 6-module program geared towards mid-career executives in health systems in Canada has in its \nfirst cohort twenty participants from four provinces. Participants complete a major project (Action \nLearning Project) that addresses an issue defined by a health organization in Canada.  Each project \nrequires ‘sign-off’ from a senior executive in that organization, and is guided by a steering committee \ncomprised of academics and executive leaders. Health organizations engaged in this year’s projects \ninclude AH, AHS, British Columbia’s Interior Health, Saskatchewan’s Ministry of Health and Quality \nCouncil and Cancer Care Ontario. \n4. Provide a statement of the priority of the proposed centre or institute within the overall priorities \nof the Faculty and/or the University of Alberta. Include a statement of benefits the University of \nPage 5 of 22\n6 \nAlberta could expect to receive through creation of the proposed centre or institute, including \nbenefits to students.  \nCreation of the Centre is an integral part of the Research component of the School of Public Health \nstrategic plan adopted in 2014. Health System Improvement is the corner stone of research in SPH, \nthe others being Environment and Health, Society and Health, and Global Health. Our proposal also \naligns well with the new UAlberta strategic Plan, For the Public Good, with relevance to all main goals. \nSpecifically Objective 11 (I, ii,iv), Objective 12 (I,ii, iii), Objective 13 (ii, vi) under EXCEL, and Objective \n16 (I,iii), Objective 17 (i), Objective 18 (ii,iii, v) under ENGAGE. \n5. Provide a description of the proposed centre/institute governance structure/reporting lines. \nInclude a diagram of organizational structure.  \nThe initial plan for the Centre is presented in the chart below. It is anticipated that this will be \nmodified in time. \nThe Centre will initially be a single-faculty centre reportable to the Dean of the School of Public \nHealth, although its key academic members are drawn from several health sciences faculties. We \nhave the endorsement of all the deans of the Health Sciences Council. It is anticipated that once \nfirmly established, the Centre will invite other health sciences (and non-health sciences) faculties to \njoin in the governance of the Centre – and also contribute to its financial sustainability. \nThe Scientific Director is the academic and administrative head of the Centre, who is a tenured faculty \nmember in the School of Public Health. There are several categories of members and fellows: \n Executive Fellows – Senior health executives, such as assistant deputy ministers and VPs of health \nauthorities, chief medical/nursing officers, etc, will be invited based on their potential \ncontributions to and support of the mission of the Centre; \n Academic Fellows – current faculty members from both SPH and other faculties, whose research \nexpertise is aligned with the Centre’s objectives, and who have strong collaborations with health \nsystem organizations; \n FHSI Members – participants who have completed our Fellowship in Health System Improvement \nexecutive program, if they do not qualify as executive or academic fellows; \n Trainee Members – postdoctoral, doctoral and master’s students enrolled in SPH or being \nsupervised by one or more Academic Fellows of the Centre \nCentre Fellows \n and Members \nScientific \nDirector \nCentre Priorities Committee \nOperations Assistant \nDean, School of \nPublic Health \nInternational \nAdvisory Board \nPage 6 of 22\n7 \nThe Scientific Director will be supported by a Centre Priorities Committee drawn from the executive \nand academic fellows, and additional advisors from outside the University. \nThe International Advisory Board consists of senior, experienced, international leaders in different \nfields who will provide strategic advice to the Centre. We have recruited the following individuals to \ndate: \n Lord Nigel Crisp, former Chief Executive, National Health Service, and Permanent Secretary, UK \nDepartment of Health; currently Independent Member, House of Lords [London, UK] \n Ken Fyke, former deputy minister of health, BC and Saskatchewan [Victoria, BC] \n Janet Davidson, former Administrator, Alberta Health Services, and deputy minister of health, \nAlberta; current Board Chair, Canadian Institute for Health Information [Victoria, BC] \n Stephen Duckett, former deputy secretary of the Commonwealth Department of Health, \nAustralia, and current health program director, Grattan Institute [Melbourne, Australia] \n Anil Arora, Chief Statistician of Canada, Statistics Canada [Ottawa, ON] \n Murray Ross, Vice President, Kaiser-Permanente Health Plan and Director, Institute of Health \nPolicy [Oakland, CA, USA]- to be confirmed \n6. Provide a statement of the role and qualifications of the centre/institute lead of the proposed \ncentre or institute. \nThe Scientific Director will be the academic and administrative head of the Centre. We intend to \nrecruit into this position. After its approval and while the Centre is being developed (year 1), the role \nof the Scientific Director would be filled by a Joint Leadership Team of 3 individuals.  These are Dr. D. \nMenon (full-time tenured faculty), Dr. T. Stafinski (full-time university staff) and Mr. A. Bhatti \n(Executive-in-Residence, SPH). During this first year, in addition to actively engaged in the recruitment \nof the Scientific Director, the joint leadership team will be responsible for developing relationships \nbetween the Centre and senior executives in the provincial health system and with faculty members \nfrom numerous disciplines whose experience, expertise and interest would contribute to the Centre’s \nwork. The team will also establish categories of affiliations among the different groups that have been \nindividually engaged with the SPH over the past years, and work with the Development Office to \npromote the Centre and attract philanthropic donations. A Centre workplan for subsequent years will \nalso be developed. \n7. Employees \na) Provide a statement of the employment status of employees (i.e., are they University of \nAlberta employees?) \nYear 1: The Joint Leadership Team will consist of a senior faculty member (0.33FTE), a university staff \nmember (0.33) and the School’s Executive-in-Residence (0.33FTE). The first 2 of these will be \nuniversity employees, and the third will have a contractual arrangement with the School of Public \nHealth. A half-time Operations Assistant will also be recruited as UAlberta non-academic staff. \nSubsequent years: A full-time Scientific Director, who will hold a faculty position in the SPH will be \nrecruited, and the Operations Assistant will convert to a full-time position. \nWe are not seeking funding from central university sources. Operational expenses will be met by \nSPH sources [see details under Financial Plan]. \nb) Personnel expenditures must include adequate provisions for benefit costs, salary \nsettlements, and other escalating factors.  \nYear 1 [Start-Up]: \nPage 7 of 22\n8 \nJoint leadership team (excludes the tenured faculty member):  $165,000 \nOperations Assistant:  $ 32,000                        \nProject costs: $75,000 \nOperating costs: $25,000 \nTOTAL: $297,000 \nSubsequent years (not including annual escalation):  \nScientific Director:  $250,000 \nOperations Assistant: $64,000 \nProject costs: $75,000 \nOperating costs: $30,000 \nTOTAL: $394,000 \nIt is anticipated that these costs will be supported, in part, through fund development. Additional \nfunds which are not included here, would include contributions from health system organizations \nwho are engaged in activities with the Centre. The Office of Advancement will also be raising funds for \nan endowed chair to assume the position of Scientific Director. The cost of the Scientific Director is \nincluded here but is actually be part of the School of Public Health’s operating budget for academic \nsalaries. \n8. Financial Plan \na) Include key sources of operating funds, and include revenue sources and expenditures for \n[ideally] 5 years projected. \nb) State specific source(s) of any “University funding” \nc) Provide a plan for the sustainable funding of the operation of the centre or institute (salaries, \nequipment and maintenance, IT support [data management, web design, etc.) \nd) Escalation factors must be built into expenditure projections (i.e. escalation due to inflation, \nfuture salary settlements,  etc.) \ne)   If in-kind support is identified, the specifics of that support must be listed separately.  \nOperational expenses will be met by SPH sources. These will be derived from its share of indirect \ncosts of research and pooling of existing large multi-year grants and contracts held by SPH faculty \nmembers. The Scientific Director’s salary is covered by SPH’s faculty budget. \nTo ensure financial sustainability, SPH will guarantee a minimum of $200,000 per year to the \nCentre for 3 years, to be tapered off by year 5, depending on centre revenue. Beyond Year 5, the \nCentre is expected to be completely self-sustaining.  \nMany of the current activities of the elements that would comprise the centre have been funded \nthrough contracts and grants from organizations in the health system. APERSU (mentioned above) \nhas a commitment of $1.32 million over 5 years, funding being provided in part by Alberta Health \nServices and the Health Quality Council of Alberta. The HTPU (also mentioned above) is currently \nfunded for a 5 –year period ($3.22 million from the government of Alberta and Health Canada). \nPRISM, the rare disease research program’s initial funding was for $1.45 for 5 years from CIHR. \nThese funds have allowed for the development of capacity to support the kinds of research and \nknowledge translation that the centre is envisaged to undertake. \nWe cannot of course predict the future, but based on our track record, we are certain of \ncontinuing service contracts from major government agencies in Alberta and also new research \ngrants from national funding agencies. The School of Public Health is committed to sustaining the \nPage 8 of 22\n9 \nadministrative and operational costs of the Centre, which is our strategic priority. \n9. Space Requirements.   \n        Space required?            Yes      No x \n         If “No” selected, where is current space? __Research Transition Facility \n         If “Yes” selected, complete the following:  \n  On-site at the University of Alberta \n  Awaiting allocation \n  Rent/lease required \n        If rent/lease is required, has this been budgeted for?      Yes      No  \n        Is funding required?      Yes      No      Reasons: _______________________________ \nAddress the following questions: \na) If rent/lease or license is required, what is the University of Alberta’s commitment?  \nb) If new space or modifications to existing space are required, has Facilities and Operations \nbeen contacted and has this been included in the budget?  \n10. Potential Risks to the University of Alberta  \na) State any reputational, financial, and/or operational risks to the University of Alberta \nb) Outline plans to mitigate/manage those risks.  \nc) Risk Management Services may be consulted.  \nWe do not anticipate any reputational, financial or operational risks to UAlberta.  Centre fellows and \nmembers abide by university-wide policies and procedures and operate under academic freedom and \nethical standards of scientific integrity. Contracts entered into by the Centre will be subject to review \nby University legal counsel as per current practice. \n11. Annual Reporting and Strategic Review: In accordance with UAPPOL Policy \na) State a provision for annual reporting to the Reporting Dean \nb) State a provision for annual reporting to the Office of the Provost \nc) State a provision for strategic and operational review by the Reporting Dean (or delegate) at \nno less frequency than every five years.  \nAnnual reports will be submitted to the Dean of the School of Public Health [reporting dean] and \nthe Office of the Provost as per the UAPPOL Academic Centres and Institutes Operation Procedure. \nThe Centre will undergo informal annual reviews by the SPH dean and vice dean, and a formal \nexternal review after 5 years. \n12. Intellectual Property (IP) and Copyright \na) Will any copyright or patentable IP be created, and if so, how will it be handled?  \nb) How will ownership and commercialization of IP be handled?  \nCurrent university policies on IP will be followed.  Issues of ownership and commercialization of IP \nand copyright will be identified and its handling specified in any service contract. \n13. Termination Plan/Provisions \na) Exigency plan for termination: If physical and/or financial resources will remain upon \ntermination, a plan for consultation with donors or agencies associated with the centre or \nPage 9 of 22\n10 \ninstitute must be included in the dissolution plan.  \nAs with all research centres, CHSI will continue to exist only if the rationale for its creation remains \nvalid. Barring overnight transformation of the health care system, the need for CHSI will remain for at \nleast a decade if not more. One potential reason for termination will be the lack of sufficient revenue \nand the inability of the Centre to continue operation after the 5 years of guaranteed support from \nSPH. All contract agreements still in force will be honoured by SPH and the work completed by \nindividual faculty members even after the Centre has been terminated. In the event of termination, \nthere will be a transition period during which staff re-deployment or layoff will be phased in. While \nseeking donor support for operations, we do not contemplate seeking or receiving endowment and  \n14.

This project is of great importance to coordinate and consolidate \nresearch in our health sciences faculties and beyond. Your proposed centre builds on a strong \nsynergistic group of expertise related to health technology assessment and other areas of \nhealth systems and policy research in your School. I agree that the centre will become a source \nof independent, expert, and evidence-based advice to governments and health authorities.   \nOne of our own professors, Cheryl Sadowski, participated in your School's Fellowship in Health \nSystem Improvement executive program this year and I anticipate her playing an important \nrole in the proposed centre, especially in relation to pharmaceutical policies. I will encourage \nothers in our Faculty to also get involved and provide their expertise. \nI welcome collaborations and ongoing engagement among our faculties. The proposed centre \nwill enhance our capacity for sustainable research projects with demonstrable impact and \noutcomes that will be wide-reaching. \nRegards, \nNeal Davies \nDean and Professor \nPage 13 of 22\nmailto:ndavies@ualberta.ca\nPage 14 of 22\nPage 15 of 22\nPage 16 of 22\nPage 17 of 22\nPage 18 of 22\nPage 19 of 22\nPage 20 of 22\nPage 21 of 22\nPage 22 of 22\nItem No. 8 \nGFC ACADEMIC PLANNING COMMITTEE \nFor the Meeting of September 13, 2017 \n OUTLINE OF ISSUE \nAction Item \nAgenda Title: Proposed Faculty Name Change: Faculty of Kinesiology, Sport, and Recreation (from \nFaculty of Physical Education and Recreation (FPER)) \nMotion:  THAT the GFC Academic Planning Committee recommend that General Faculties Council approve \nthe proposed name change for the Faculty of Physical Education and Recreation to the ‘Faculty of \nKinesiology, Sport, and Recreation’, as submitted by the Dean of the Faculty, to take effect upon final \napproval. \nItem   \nAction Requested Approval Recommendation   \nProposed by Kerry Mummery, Dean, Faculty of Physical Education & Recreation \nPresenter Kerry Mummery, Dean, Faculty of Physical Education & Recreation \nDetails \nResponsibility Provost and Vice-President (Academic) \nThe Purpose of the Proposal is \n(please be specific) \nTo change the name of the Faculty of FPER to a name that more \naccurately depicts its academic mission and offerings, in support of \nattracting the best and brightest students and faculty, and being \nrecognized as a leader among its peers. Over the past academic year \nFPER Faculty members, staff, students, alumni and stakeholders were \ngiven the opportunity to provide input on a new Faculty name. After a \nformal process Faculty Council endorsed the name Faculty of \nKinesiology, Sport, and Recreation. \nThe Impact of the Proposal is The new Faculty name better defines and describes the teaching, \nresearch and service activities of the Faculty. The new name will both \ndefine and differentiate the Faculty at the national and international level, \nthus helping to attract top quality students, faculty and staff. \nReplaces/Revises (eg, policies, \nresolutions) \nCurrent name:  Faculty of Physical Education and Recreation. \nTimeline/Implementation Date Effective upon approval. \nEstimated Cost and funding \nsource \nThe estimated cost of name change is approximately $250,000, which \nincludes costs related to signage inside and outside of all Faculty \nbuildings on North and South Campus, the update of all Faculty-named \nmedia, marketing and promotional material, and well as a dedicated \nmarketing and communication plan to promote the new name locally, \nprovincially, nationally, and internationally. Funds to support the costs of \nthe name change will come from the Faculty, the Office of the Provost \nand Vice-President (Academic), and the Office of the Vice President \nUniversity Relations. \nNext Steps (ie.: \nCommunications Plan, \nImplementation plans) \nOn final approval by GFC, the Marketing and Communication office in \nthe Faculty will complete both a ‘soft’ and ‘hard’ launch of the new \nFaculty name. The soft launch will immediately begin using the new \nFaculty name on any item that allows for immediate alteration (i.e. email \nsignatures, newly created Faculty documents, etc.). The soft launch will \noccur immediately following approval by GFC. The hard launch of the \nnew Faculty name will take place when all of the marketing, media, \npromotional material and way-finding signage are prepared. Upon hard \nlaunch all references to the former Faculty name will be removed, and \nthe former Faculty name will only be used in the historical context. \nSupplementary Notes and  \nItem No. 8 \nGFC ACADEMIC PLANNING COMMITTEE \nFor the Meeting of September 13, 2017 \n context \nEngagement and Routing (Include meeting dates) \nParticipation: \n(parties who have seen the \nproposal and in what capacity) \n<For further information see \nthe link posted on the \nGovernance Toolkit section \nStudent Participation Protocol> \nThose who have been informed: \n• Canadian Council of University Physical Education and \nKinesiology Administrators (CCUPEKA) \n• Presidential Visiting Committee (PVC) \n• International Partner Universities  \nThose who have been consulted: \n• Faculty staff, students, and alumni \n• Physical Education and Recreation Council of Students (PERCS) \n• Physical Education and Recreation and Recreation Graduate \nStudents Society (PERGGS) \n• Physical Education and Recreation Alumni Associate (PERRA) \n• Community stakeholders \nThose who are actively participating: \n• Faculty of Physical Education and Recreation Academic Planning \nCommittee \n• Faculty of Physical Education and Recreation Faculty \nManagement Group (APC) \n• Faculty of Physical Education and Recreation Faculty Council \nExecutive Committee (FEXC) \n• Faculty of Physical Education and Recreation Faculty Council \nApproval Route (Governance) \n(including meeting dates) \nFaculty of Physical Education and Recreation Council  \nGFC Academic Planning Committee – September 13, 2017 \nGFC Executive Committee (for information) – September 11, 2017 \nGeneral Faculties Council – September 25, 2017 \nFinal Approver General Faculties Council \nAlignment/Compliance \nAlignment with Guiding \nDocuments \nThe name Faculty of Kinesiology, Sport, and Recreation will position \nthe Faculty to ‘build a diverse, inclusive community of exceptional \nundergraduate and graduate students from Edmonton, Alberta, Canada \nand the world’ (Institutional Strategic Plan 2016 – 2021, Objective 1) by \nbetter describing the areas of research, teaching and service. The \nunique-in-Canada inclusion of the term ‘sport’ in the faculty name will \noffer a point of differentiation on the international scene, whereas the \nreplacement of the name Physical Education with Kinesiology aligns the \nofferings of the Faculty with our domestic competitors. The renaming of \nthe Faculty will address Objective 6 of the Institution Plan, by developing \na ‘brand platform’ that will enhance our reputation, image and identity. \nThe renaming of the Faculty aligns the name/brand of the Faculty with its \nmission and mandate, which is to ‘create and share (sic) the best \nunderstandings and applications of physical activity, sport and recreation \nfor the public good’ (Faculty Strategic Plan 2016-2021). Consistent and \naligned with the Institutional plan, the renaming of the Faculty positions \nthe Faculty to Recruit and enroll high quality students and increase the \nnumber of out-of-province and international students in the Faculty \n(aligns with Faculty Strategic Plan; Build).

First established in 1964 as the\nFaculty of Physical Education, the Faculty is one of the oldest and most prestigious faculties of its type in the\ncountry. In 1976 the Faculty added Recreation to the name, to reflect our undergraduate degree in recreation,\nCanada’s longest running degree in this area, which has been offered for more than 50 years. In 2015, the Faculty\nchanged our Bachelor of Physical Education (BPE) degree to a Bachelor of Kinesiology, which precipitated to the\nprocess of name change for the Faculty.  Currently we offer the following degrees within the Faculty: \n·   Bachelor of Arts in Recreation, Sport and Tourism (BARST) \n·   Bachelor of Kinesiology (BKin) \n·   Bachelor of Science in Kinesiology (BSc Kin) \n·   Master of Arts (MA) \n·   Master of Science (MSc) \n·   Master of Coaching (MCoach) \n·   Doctor of Philosophy (PhD)\nAfter a year-long process of engaging faculty, staff, students, alumni, and stakeholders a vote was held at Faculty\nCouncil this May, which supported the name “ Faculty of Kinesiology, Sport, and Recreation.” This name and\nsupporting documentation – including your letter of support – will go forward for approval by the University’s\nGovernance structure.\nmailto:christine.ma@ualberta.ca\n9/8/2017 University of Alberta Mail - Fwd: Letter of Support - Faculty Name Change - Response Requested.\nhttps://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/?ui=2&ik=6d333bea76&jsver=EfWGX3tyASk.en.&view=pt&cat=ACT%20ON%2FRequests&search=cat&th=15e5939d8d749898… 3/3\nIf successfully supported by University Governance, our Faculty will become one of the last faculties of our type in\nthe country to transition from Physical Education to Kinesiology; the longest running faculty in the country with\nRecreation in its name; and the first faculty in Canada to include Sport in its name.\nAs part of the name change process we are required to get letters of support from relevant stakeholders. I ask that\nyou provide notice of support, or lack thereof, to me by return email. This note could be as long, or as brief as you\nwish, but I would be most appreciative that is show a clear indication of support for the name change from you, our\nvalued partner.  If you have any questions or concerns feel free to contact me at your convenience.\nChristine Ma, BPE, MBA\nAssistant Dean, International and Community Education\nFaculty of Physical Education & Recreation\n3-119 Van Vliet Complex\nUniversity of Alberta\nEdmonton T6G 2H9\n780­492­5801 | christine.ma@ualberta.ca\ntel:(780)%20492-5801\nmailto:christine.ma@ualberta.ca\nTechnical University of \nMünchen \nProf. Dr. Dr. \nJürgen Beckmann \nUptown München \nCampus D \nGeorg-Brauchle-Ring 60-62 \n80992 München  \nGermany \nfon  +49.89.289.24541 \nfax +49.89.289.24555 \njuergen.beckmann@tum.de \nwww.sportpsychologie.sg.tum.de \nDepartment of  \nSport and Health Sciences \nChair of Sport Psychology \nTechnical University of Munich \nFakultät für Sport- und Gesundheitswissenschaft    Georg-Brauchle-Ring 60-62     80992 München \nName change of the \nFaculty of Faculty of Physical Education and Recreation \nIn its 2014 report the President’s Visiting Committee (PVC) stated that the \nfaculty’s “Physical Education and Recreation” was misleading as the major \ngoal of the Faculty does not lie in the education of PE teachers. Clearly, the \nFaculty’s name is a historic name associated with much success. However, \nthe PVC considered the name as unsuited for increased international \nvisibility and attracting international students. Therefore, the PVC \nrecommended changing the Faculty Name.  \nAs the PVC learned the Faculty entered a process to review and rename the \nFaculty. As a result of this process a change of name to “ Faculty of \nKinesiology, Sport, and Recreation” was suggested by the Faculty Council.  \nThe (PVC) is convinced that this name change is in line with the development \nof the Faculty and will contribute to an advancement in recruitment, branding, \nand internationalization. Therefore, the PVC very much supports the \nproposed change of name for the Faculty of Physical Education and \nRecreation at the University of Alberta. \nMunich, August 1, 2017 \nJürgen Beckmann \nChair of the President’s Visiting Committee \nPresident of the University of Alberta \nDr. David H.

First established in 1964 as the\nFaculty of Physical Education, the Faculty is one of the oldest and most prestigious faculties of its type in the\ncountry. In 1976 the Faculty added Recreation to the name, to reflect our undergraduate degree in recreation,\nCanada’s longest running degree in this area, which has been offered for more than 50 years. In 2015, the Faculty\nchanged our Bachelor of Physical Education (BPE) degree to a Bachelor of Kinesiology, which precipitated to the\nprocess of name change for the Faculty.  Currently we offer the following degrees within the Faculty: \n·   Bachelor of Arts in Recreation, Sport and Tourism (BARST) \n·   Bachelor of Kinesiology (BKin) \n·   Bachelor of Science in Kinesiology (BSc Kin) \n·   Master of Arts (MA) \n·   Master of Science (MSc) \n·   Master of Coaching (MCoach) \n·   Doctor of Philosophy (PhD)\nAfter a year-long process of engaging faculty, staff, students, alumni, and stakeholders a vote was held at Faculty\nCouncil this May, which supported the name “ Faculty of Kinesiology, Sport, and Recreation.” This name and\nsupporting documentation – including your letter of support – will go forward for approval by the University’s\nGovernance structure.\nmailto:christine.ma@ualberta.ca\n9/8/2017 University of Alberta Mail - Fwd: Letter of Support - Faculty Name Change - Response Requested.\nhttps://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/?ui=2&ik=6d333bea76&jsver=EfWGX3tyASk.en.&view=pt&cat=ACT%20ON%2FRequests&search=cat&th=15e5939d8d749898… 3/3\nIf successfully supported by University Governance, our Faculty will become one of the last faculties of our type in\nthe country to transition from Physical Education to Kinesiology; the longest running faculty in the country with\nRecreation in its name; and the first faculty in Canada to include Sport in its name.\nAs part of the name change process we are required to get letters of support from relevant stakeholders. I ask that\nyou provide notice of support, or lack thereof, to me by return email. This note could be as long, or as brief as you\nwish, but I would be most appreciative that is show a clear indication of support for the name change from you, our\nvalued partner.  If you have any questions or concerns feel free to contact me at your convenience.\nChristine Ma, BPE, MBA\nAssistant Dean, International and Community Education\nFaculty of Physical Education & Recreation\n3-119 Van Vliet Complex\nUniversity of Alberta\nEdmonton T6G 2H9\n780­492­5801 | christine.ma@ualberta.ca\ntel:(780)%20492-5801\nmailto:christine.ma@ualberta.ca\nItem No. 9 \nGFC ACADEMIC PLANNING COMMITTEE \nFor the Meeting of September 13, 2017 \nOUTLINE OF ISSUE \nDiscussion Item \nAgenda Title: White Paper: A Brief Analysis of Arguments For and Against Creation of Teaching-Only \nStream, Students’ Union \nItem   \nProposed by Fahim Rahman, GFC CLE Subcommittee to Explore Teaching Tenure \nStream at University of Alberta, and President of the Students’ Union \n(2016-2017) \nPresenter Shane Scott, Vice President (Academic), Students’ Union \nDetails \nResponsibility Provost and Vice-President (Academic) \nThe Purpose of the Proposal is \n(please be specific) \nTo discuss the White Paper: A Brief Analysis of Arguments For and \nAgainst Creation of Teaching-Only Stream.  \nTimeline/Implementation Date N/A \nSupplementary Notes and \ncontext \nThe white paper was accepted by GFC Committee on the Learning \nEnvironment on April 5, 2017 and is forwarded to APC for discussion. \nThe committee noted upcoming changes in the Contract Academic Staff: \nTeaching (CAS:T) agreement and suggested the impact be incorporated \ninto the paper.

While there are some similarities between the Canadian system and \nthe American one, it is safe to say that the American system is more stratified and strained than \nthe Canadian one. Therefore, particularly when looking at teaching outcomes, many of the \napparent downsides of hiring teaching-only stream faculty may actually be attributable to \nsystemic chronic-underfunding, rather than shortcomings of the individuals in these positions. \nFor instance, one study mentions that teaching-only faculty are less likely to have office hours on \ncampus, but then recounts a story about an instructor converting a utility closet to an office.1 \nCanadian universities are – generally speaking – facing less severe challenges and the issues that \nappear to plague American contingent instructors would likely be rather foreign to their \nCanadian counterparts.  \nAdditionally, there is lack of available longitudinal data on how student outcomes have changed \nbefore and after the establishment of teaching-stream. This makes conclusively proving that \nteaching-stream improves student outcomes challenging. However, there is a strong inductive \nargument that the introduction of tenure, with its benefits of job security and the potential for \npedagogical research, will have a positive impact on student outcomes. \nArguments against Teaching Stream: \nThere are a number of issues that arise when looking at the workability of implementing a \nteaching stream. Some of which are valuable questions to ask, while other others seem to flow \nfrom a philosophical aversion to teaching-intensive positions. A major challenge is, of course, \nhow to develop and implement a teaching-intensive tenure stream, and whether or not that \nstream should be fully integrated within the traditional tenure system, or rather if it should \nsomehow operate in a separate, yet parallel space. A Council of Ontario Universities (COU) \nreport argues that as long as teaching is valued, rightly or wrongly, less than research, integrating \nthese teaching-intensive roles into the standard tenure system will only perpetuate the bias \nagainst those focused primarily on teaching.2 While this concern appears somewhat valid, as this \nissue frequently comes up in interviews with teaching stream faculty, it is likely that \n1 Adrianna Kezar, “Examining Non-Tenure Track Faculty Perceptions of How Departmental Policies and Practices Shape Their \nPerformance and Ability to Create Student Learning at Four-Year Institutions,” Research in Higher Education 54, no. 5 (2013): \n587. \n2 Leslie Sanders, Teaching Stream Positions: Some Implications (Toronto, 2011). \n  2 \nnormalization of teaching-stream faculty, and the likely persistent salary differentiation should \nserve to partially ameliorate this problem.3  \nThe COU also implies that, somehow, a focus on teaching may erode the “robust culture of \ninquiry in undergraduate education” that should be present on campus.4 Of the many objections \nraised by those who oppose the introduction of teaching stream stream faculty, this one is \nperhaps the most problematic and persistent. Traditional discourses on the role and structure of \nthe university tend to assume a high degree of complementarity between research and teaching, \nand on many levels, this relationship appears natural and rational.5 However, the data on \nundergraduate education quality presents a more complicated picture. The majority of literature \nsuggests that there is no relationship between quality of research and quality of teaching, and \nfurther that both teaching and research intensive faculty are adequately equipped to provide \nstudents with both a broad base of knowledge and specific insights into their field.6The evolution \nand rising importance of research productivity at universities has created an incentive structure \nsuch that for academics employed in ‘traditional’ roles, research tends to take precedence over \nteaching and pedagogical research. The introduction of a teaching stream should help mediate \nthese competing interests, and create ‘space’ within a department for the furthering of teaching \nmethods (including scholarship of teaching) without negatively impacting the research \nproductivity of research-focused professors. Further, a more accurate predictor of student \nlearning outcomes seems to be an individual’s employment of certain teaching strategies – \nstrategies that are not, by any means, accessible only to research-focused academics.7  \nThere is also the issue of the overall research quality and prestige of an institution, as both are at \npotentially at risk if the professoriate becomes dominated by individuals not actively engaged in \ntraditional research. While this concern may be valid, there is no real way of addressing it \nwithout getting into a larger discussion about the root cause of this issue, university funding. If \nan institution is being faced with stagnant or shrinking budgets, while also facing growing \nenrollment, there is no way out of that predicament that does not involve making painful choices. \nFurther, it is unlikely that any major Canadian research institution (particularly U15) is intent on \ndecimating the number of research-focused academics at their school, so the concern about the \nerosion of prestige seems to be more of a straw man than a substantive concern.  \nThe majority of arguments offered against the creation of teaching stream position are offered by \ntwo specific subsets of the academic community. One group is the already privileged set of \nindividuals who have the benefit of tenure and therefore need not be particularly concerned about \n3 Susan Vajoczki et al., “Teaching-Stream Faculty in Ontario Universities The Higher Education Quality Council of Ontario” \n(2011): 36–37. \n4 Sanders, Teaching Stream Positions: Some Implications, 6. \n5 Ruth Neumann, “Perceptions of the Teaching-Research Nexus: A Framework for Analysis,” Higher Education 23, no. 2 (1992): \n159–171. \n6 J.

Wawrzynski, “Contingent Faculty as Teachers: What We Know; What We Need to Know,” American \nBehavioral Scientist 55, no. 11 (2011): 1501. \n  3 \ntheir job security, or ability to earn a stable, fair income.8 The other group are those who are \npresently employed in teaching-intensive roles but who would prefer to be employed in a more \n‘traditional’, i.e. research-intensive position.9 For them, they see the codification and \nformalization of teaching stream as detrimental, as these roles, viewed by some young academics \nas transitory, will increasingly become institutionalized and permanent. Both of these objections \nare problematic, as each group seems to presuppose that every individual within the academic \ncommunity has, or ought to have, ambitions to carry out intensive research. Obviously, this is not \nthe case, and there a number of instructors at other universities who have spoken to the fact that \nthey prefer and also enjoy teaching. In some cases, the creation of secure, teaching-intensive \npositions has even drawn professors from other universities, eager to extricate themselves from \nthe “publish-or-die” attitude of more traditional faculty appointments.10 Even for individuals \n‘stuck’ teaching, who would prefer to be employed in a position that involved a greater degree of \nresearch, the introduction of job security and retention incentives is most likely preferable to the \ntumultuous status-quo of being sessional or contract instructors.  \nThere is some literature that suggests that part-time instructors may negatively impact student \nlearning outcomes and retention.11 This concern comes from speculation that part-time faculty \nare less likely than their full-time, tenured colleagues to understand the campus culture, be \nfamiliar with services to support student success and be less willing to engage with students \noutside the classroom. If this is the case, and that in and of itself is questionable, it strengthens \nthe argument for the adoption of teaching-stream tenure positions, or other means of providing \njob security and a sense of belonging to contract faculty, as the provision of these benefits will \nlikely increase their connection to the institution and their investment in better understanding the \ncampus and associated services. A large body of research, which holds that job security and job \nperformance are positively correlated, supports this conclusion.12  A renewed incentive structure \nand reduced uncertainty makes these sort of productivity-enhancing investments worthwhile for \nthe affected instructors. A study of the impact of instructor status on teaching quality at a large \nCanadian university found that “there is not a strong correlation between research-focused and \nteaching-focused college instructors – both have effective and noneffective teachers within each \ngroup…instructors do not make a large difference to student achievement”.13 These findings \n8 For example, see: Sanders, Teaching Stream Positions: Some Implications. \n9 Lee Bessette, “The Teaching Track?

February (2009): 92. \n  4 \nsuggest that stated concern about teaching-intensive faculty eroding the quality of education is \nvastly overstated. In fact, there is some evidence that suggests teaching-intensive faculty can \nactually have a positive impact on the quality of education at the undergraduate level.  \nArguments for Teaching Stream: \nThere are a number of strong practical, as well as philosophical arguments for the adoption of \nsome form of teaching stream at the University of Alberta. Much of the recent scholarship on \nteaching quality has consistently found that there is either no difference in educational quality \nbetween tenured and contract instructors or, in some cases, that these non-tenured teachers \nactually improve student success and engagement. A study conducted at Northwestern \nUniversity found a statistically significant increase in both students’ grades and the likelihood of \nthem taking another class in a field if they took a class taught by an instructor rather than a \ntenure-track professor.14 While instructors at Northwestern do not have the benefit of formal \nteaching stream, Northwestern has pursued a policy of nurturing long-term, secure relationships \nwith their instructors. These are individuals “with benefits, career ladders and job security”– \nsomething which could be considered roughly, albeit imperfectly, analogous to tenure.15  \nAnother study that looked nationally at teaching methods in the United States found that full-\ntime faculty, regardless of whether or not they were tenured, were more likely than their part-\ntime counterparts to employ both learning (essays, presentations and peer assessment) and \nsubject (multiple choice exams, short answer exams) centered approaches to teaching, while \npart-time faculty was heavily reliant on only subject-centered evaluations.16 This finding led the \nresearchers to conclude that the most effective allocation of a university’s funds was to focus on \nensuring that contingent instructors were offered full-time positions, as by virtue of being full-\ntime, they were more likely to employ a broad, and constructive, array of evaluative methods.17It \nis worth noting here that there was no difference in the methods of research vs. teaching \nintensive faculty, suggesting that the nature of employment matters more than the individual’s \nfocus.  \nThere is a notable lack of research into the impact of teaching only or contingent faculty on \nlearning outcomes in Canada. The only econometrically sound study of instructor status and \nperceived educational quality was the aforementioned one which found no statistically-\n14 David Figlio, Morton Schapiro, and Kevin Soter, Are Tenure Track Professors Better Teachers?, NBER Working Paper Series \n(Cambridge, MA, 2013), http://www.nber.org/papers/w19406. \n15 Ibid., 9.David Figlio, “Sunday Dialogue: Academia’s Two Tracks,” The New York Times, 2013, \nhttp://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/17/opinion/sunday/sunday-dialogue-academias-two-tracks.html?_r=0. \n16 Baldwin and Wawrzynski, “Contingent Faculty as Teachers: What We Know; What We Need to Know,” 1494. \n17 Ibid., 1505. \n  5 \nsignificant relationship; however the authors did find that teaching-focused instructors received a \nnominally higher score when being assessed on perceived teaching effectiveness.18  \nTeaching Tenure – Policies and Protections  \nAmerican Examples:  \n• The American Association of University Professors (AAUP) has an appendix in a major \nreport on teaching stream initiatives which highlights the approaches that different US \nschools to instituting policies around this new category. Many of the schools listed are \npublically funded, and are therefore reasonable comparators. Most notably, the \nPennsylvania State University system has instituted a formal teacher tenure track, while \nthe University of California system has implemented a system wherein there is no formal \ntenure, but instructors are granted longer-term contracts and more equitable salaries and \nbenefits.  \n• Appendix can be found here: http://www.aaup.org/report/tenure-and-teaching-intensive-\nappointments  \nCanadian Examples:  \n• University of Manitoba: According to a cursory review of the 2010-2013 Collective \nBargaining Agreement it appears as though the university’s teaching-intensive positions \n(Instructor/Lecturer designation) are afforded the same benefits as traditional faculty, \nincluding the ability to accrue research leave and longer-term contracts. Their salaries, \nhowever, are prorated.  \n• University of Toronto – Lecturer and Senior Lecturer, permanent appointments  \n• York: Alternate-Stream Appointment  \n• Waterloo: Continuing Lecturer \n• Dalhousie, McMaster, UBC, SFU and the University of Regina all also have similar \nagreements in place with their instructors and contingent faculty. \nSecuring Institutional and Strategic Commitment  \nWhile the aforementioned schools appear to have created these new positions without excessive \npushback from faculty, there have been some exceptions, where existing faculty associations \nhave strongly pushed back against the creation of teaching stream stream positions – most \nnotably at the University of Ottawa and University of Windsor.19 While there is little information \navailable on the specific issues that faculty at these institutions raised, it is reasonable to assume \nthat they were similar to the general arguments against teaching tenure outlined above. \n18 Hoffmann and Oreopoulos, “Professor Qualities and Student Achievement,” 88. \n19 Farr, “For Teaching-Only Faculty, a Controversial Role.” \nhttp://www.aaup.org/report/tenure-and-teaching-intensive-appointments\nhttp://www.aaup.org/report/tenure-and-teaching-intensive-appointments\nhttps://www.google.ca/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&ved=0CBwQFjAAahUKEwiRkbnfx5rIAhUQRYgKHczcBLc&url=http%3A%2F%2Fumanitoba.ca%2Fadmin%2Fhuman_resources%2Fservices%2Fmedia%2FFinal_version_2010_2013_UMFA_Collective_Agreement.doc&usg=AFQjCNFH7hg6lZoYlenuTYS7U_tj_3SEJg&bvm=bv.103388427,d.cGU&cad=rja\n  6 \nDuring discussions at the Committee on the Learning Environment, it was noted that attention \nshould be paid to the name or title given to members in this potential category. For example, at \nthe University of Toronto individuals recruited in both “teaching stream” and ‘traditional stream’ \nare called professors.. Both are referred to as assistant, associate or full professors depending on \ncareer stage. Alternatively, at UBC, the teaching stream is referred to as “educational leadership \nstream” and progression is made from an instructor position, to a senior instruction, and finally a \nfull professor of teaching with tenure. Members of the Committee on the Learning Environment \nbelieved that the name/title used to refer to individuals in teaching stream may be significant in \nensuring that these members are a valued part of campus, and are regarded similarly, if not \nequally, for their responsibilities and contribution as traditional professors. \nIf the University of Alberta were to move forward on this issue, it would be critical to more \nclosely examine the processes that were used with success at York University, the University of \nToronto and UBC. It would also be helpful to initiate conversations with the Students’ Unions at \nthese institutions to determine how, if at all, they were included in these discussions.  \nThe Delphi Project on Changing Faculty and Student Success, located the University of \nSouthern California, has developed a number of resources designed at facilitating discussions \naround the role and status of teaching-intensive faculty members.20 This includes tracking the \npaths of successful attempts to address and change the role of these instructors on a number of \ncampuses in the United States.
