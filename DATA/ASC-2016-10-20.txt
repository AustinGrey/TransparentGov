Dr Hall provided members with the rationale for the proposal, noting that there would be no changes to current course offerings and the renamed programs would provide more flexibility for students. She explained that the proposal was developed with extensive consultation with students and other Faculties and that the students who participated in the consultation expressed strong support for the changes. Dr Leskiw reported that the merging of departments in the 1990s into the current Department of Biological Sciences was not accompanied by a rationalization of program offerings and that the recent environment has been conducive to focus on the learning experience for students and the resultant changes proposed. During the ensuing discussion, a member expressed concern that members of the Faculty of Medicine and Dentistry were not properly consulted during the development of the proposal.

In addition to academic requirements \nfor admission, GFC authorizes each Faculty to establish such other \nreasonable criteria for admission of applicants as the Faculty may \nconsider appropriate to its programs of study, subject to the approval of \nGFC (e.g. interview, audition, portfolio, etc.) \nThe admission requirements for any Faculty will be those approved by \nGFC as set forth in the current edition of the University Calendar. In \naddition to the admission requirements, selection criteria for quota \nprograms, where they exist, will also be published in the current edition \nof the University Calendar. \nThe responsibility for admission decisions will be vested in the Faculty \nAdmission Committees or in the Deans of the respective Faculties, as \nItem 4 - page 3\nItem No. 4A - D \nGFC ACADEMIC STANDARDS COMMITTEE \nFor the Meeting of October 20, 2016 \nthe councils of such Faculties will determine.” \n4.

Where changes to admission regulations may disadvantage students \nin the current admission cycle, normally implementation will be effective \nafter the change has been published in the University Calendar for one \nfull year (i.e., effective the second year that the information is published \nin the University Calendar). \nFor example, a change approved in May 2005 would be first published in \nthe 2006-2007 University Calendar in March 2006. Therefore the \nstatement cannot come into effect until September 2007 (affecting \napplicants who apply for the September 2007 term beginning July \n2006).” \nb. Where changes to admission regulations are deemed by the \napproving body to be ‘advantageous to students’, normally the date of \nimplementation will be effective immediately or at the next available \nintake for the admitting Faculty.” \n5.  PSLA: The PSLA gives Faculty Councils the authority to “determine \nthe conditions under which a student must withdraw from or may \ncontinue the student’s program of studies in a faculty” (Section 29(1)(d)). \n6. UAPPOL Academic Standing Policy:  “All current academic \nstanding regulations, including academic standing categories, University \ngraduating standards and requirements for all individual programs will be \nthose prescribed by Faculty Councils and GFC as set forth in the \nUniversity Calendar.” \n7. UAPPOL Academic Standing Regulations Procedures: “All \nproposed new academic standing regulations and changes to existing \nacademic standing regulations will be submitted by the Faculties or the \nAdministration to the Provost and Vice-President (Academic). Faculties \nwill also submit to the Provost and Vice-President (Academic) any \nproposed changes to the use and/or computation of averages relating to \nacademic standing, including promotion and graduation. \nIf the Provost and Vice-President (Academic) determines the proposal to \nbe in good order, the proposal will be introduced to the appropriate \nUniversity governance process(es). In considering these proposals, \ngovernance bodies will consult as necessary with the Faculties and with \nother individuals and offices. \nNormally, changes become effective once they are approved by GFC or \nits delegate and are published in the University Calendar.” \nAttachments  \nItem 4 - page 4\nItem No. 4A - D \nGFC ACADEMIC STANDARDS COMMITTEE \nFor the Meeting of October 20, 2016 \n1.

The proposed changes to consolidate our undergraduate honors \nand specialization programs will enhance undergraduate student experiences and more \naccurately communicate the breadth, strengths and focus of the Biological Sciences \nprograms. We are a large and diverse department that provides substantive experiential \nlearning, however the size of our department can pose challenges for undergraduate \nstudents trying to choose our programs or discern differences amongst the breadth of \ndisciplines. We currently offer seven honors and seven specialization programs, which \nmostly reflected outdated boundaries of departments that were merged into a larger \nBiological Sciences Department over 20 years ago. The proposed changes avoid taxonomic \n1 Please note that this section entitled “Summary of Suite of Program Changes in the Department of Biological” is repeated \nin seven documents submitted at same time: Animal Biology Suspension, Ecology Name Change, Evolutionary Biology \nSuspension, Microbiology Suspension, Molecular Genetics Name Change, Physiology and Developmental Biology Name \nChange, and Plant Biology Suspension. \nItem 5 - page 5\n 2 \ndesignations (e.g., Animal Biology, Plant Biology) and more appropriately reflect broader \nareas in Biological Sciences, rather than revolve content around specific organisms that \nmay be used to study these important disciplines. The outcome of this re-evaluation is a \nreduction in our total number of programs, while still providing students with an exemplary \neducation that reflects appropriate depth and breadth to meet the challenges of changing \nand broad career opportunities in the Biological Sciences. \nThe set of Program Name Changes and Program Suspension submitted reflects this \ndepartmental-wide consolidation of seven honors/specialization programs (Animal \nBiology, Ecology, Evolutionary Biology, Molecular Genetics, Microbiology, Physiology \nand Developmental Biology, and Plant Biology) to three:  \n(1) Ecology, Evolution and Environmental Biology (newly proposed name for Ecology); \n(2) Integrative Physiology (newly proposed name for Physiology and Developmental \nBiology); and \n(3) Molecular, Cellular and Developmental Biology (newly proposed name for Molecular \nGenetics). \nSimultaneously, we propose to suspend the following honors/specialization programs: \n(1) Animal Biology \n(2) Evolutionary Biology \n(3) Microbiology \n(4) Plant Biology \nWe are not proposing changes to either of our joint programs: (1) Immunology and \nInfection (joint with Medical Microbiology and Immunology) or (2) Paleontology (joint \nwith Department of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences).  Nor are we proposing any changes \nto the General Biological Sciences Major. \nThese changes result in programs that have broad appeal, provide greater flexibility, and \naccurately describe program learning outcomes and content.  We are not changing the core \nrequirements of any of the three newly named programs but rather highlighting expanded \nlistings of course choices to meet the learning outcomes of the programs. All programs \ncontinue to share a common set of first year course requirements.  \nAll students in suspended programs will be given the opportunity to complete their \nprograms. For those students who are interested in these suspended programs, all of them \nare fully captured in the three renamed programs. Depending on interests, there is one of \nthe newly named programs that is a natural fit, for others, there may be more than one of \nthe newly named programs that would work. For example, Evolutionary Biology has \nalways been an integral part of the Ecology program. Similarly, Microbiology and Plant \nBiology courses were incorporated into and remain key to our Molecular, Cellular and \nDevelopmental Biology Programs (newly proposed name for Molecular Genetics \nPrograms). Students interested in the Plant Biology and Microbiology programs will just as \neasily fit in the Ecology, Evolution and Environmental Biology Programs (newly proposed \nname for Ecology Programs) if they are more interested how these organisms evolve and \ninteract in their environment than their molecular basis. Along these veins, all three newly \nItem 5 - page 6\n3 \nnamed programs would fulfill goals of students interested in Animal Biology, depending on \nwhether they wanted to focus on their physiology, their ecology and evolution, or their \nmolecular and cellular processes.  \nThis consolidation of programs also permits students to explore more of the large and \ndiverse Department of Biological Sciences offerings. If they discover an unexpected \ninterest (ie, genetics students discovering love for plant biology), they are now able to more \neasily take additional courses in that area without having to formally change programs. \nSwitching programs often results in students taking an extra term or extra year to complete \nrequirements. Similarly, students who have identified and maintain a particular fascination \n(e.g., animal biology) will have the direction to take classes that provide substantial depth \nof knowledge in that discipline. The consolidated course listings within the three renamed \nprograms makes them less restrictive for undergraduate students, thus taking perhaps \noverly complicated programs to ones that provide more choice. The learning outcomes, \ncore requirements, rigor, depth, and excellence of our programs remain the same.  \nFurther, the newly structured programs maintain and increase the flexibility for students to \nparticipate in the Science Internship Program (SIP) and/or completion of the Research \nCertificate in Science (Biological Sciences). These two opportunities are aligned with the \nUniversity of Alberta’s new Institutional Strategic Plan “For the Public Good” that sets out \nto increase access to internships and support for excellence in teaching, particularly \nexperiential learning, as objectives. \nThis restructuring was initiated at a Department of Biological Sciences Executive Retreat \nin November 2014, wherein we challenged ourselves to reexamine our undergraduate \nprograms as though they were new rather than products of historical departments. The \nproposed restructuring was then discussed and/or voted on at three departmental council \nmeetings (15 April 2015, 9 December 2015, 10 February 2016).  Further, we facilitated \ndepartment-wide discussion of changes via two avenues. First, we developed a \ndepartmental website that included our student survey (see below) and proposed changes to \nour programs. Second, we coordinated three informal meetings to which our invested \nstakeholders attended and discussed changes to our newly named programs (30 November \n2015, 1 December 2015, 4 December 2015).  \nImportantly, students also support this restructuring. In March 2015, we conducted an \nanonymous online survey of our Biological Sciences students. We also led three focal \nmeetings with groups of students including students registered in our honors/specialization \nprograms and in the general program (two on 27 March 2015, one on 30 March 2015). Of \nthe 554 respondents to the online survey, 192 were in our honor/specialization programs (= \n44% of total students enrolled in the honors/specialization programs) and 353 were in the \nGeneral Biological Sciences Program (= 23% of the total number of students in the General \nProgram). The majority of these respondents (71%) stated that our seven \nhonors/specialization programs have limited (which allowed us to determine which \nprograms to maintain) and strong (which allowed us to determine which programs to \nsuspend) overlap. Similarly, students indicated that having three honors/specialization \nItem 5 - page 7\n 4 \nprograms versus seven was acceptable (29%), slightly acceptable (26%), neutral (20%), \nslightly unacceptable (18%), and unacceptable (7%).  In sum, 75% of the students surveyed \neither accepted or were neutral about the consolidation to three honors/specialization \nprograms. A few comments regarding these changes are provided here: \n● “I actually quite like the idea of three overarching areas of study. It makes decision-\nmaking easier and less overwhelming while still maintaining the aspect of choice.” \n● “It is confusing distinguishing between the many different programs.” \n● “It can be a little bit overwhelming differentiating between all of the programs.” \n● “There is so much overlap between all of the biological sciences programs – \nespecially between different ‘animal related’/‘plant’/‘ecology’ related programs that \neven though there are quite a few different programs offered, the overlap effectively \nreduces the number of programs offered because they’re all so similar.” \n● “I feel as though the programs that exist are not easily understandable.” \nConversely, a small minority opinion is that the focus of seven programs provides \nappropriate depth for students who have a passion in one of these areas (e.g., Microbiology, \nPlant Biology). We greatly appreciate these concerns and will ameliorate them in three \nways. First, we will effectively use our departmental website to help students choose \ncourses that meet degree requirements and emphasize particular subdisciplines by \nidentifying informal streams within newly named programs. Second, we will maintain our \nset of faculty advisors who can actively help students identify interests and understand \nappropriate course sequences to achieve their academic goals. Finally, we are not changing \nour course offerings, such that with few minor exceptions all of our current courses are still \navailable to our students. In other words, all newly named programs accommodate these \ninterests. \nRationale for suspending our Animal Biology Programs \nOver the past decade, enrolment in the honors and specialization Animal Biology programs \nhas been between 60-85 students/year: \nAcademic \nYear \nTotal number of students \nregistered in our \nhonors/specialization \nprograms \nNumber of students enrolled in Honors \nand Specialization Animal Biology \nPrograms (percentage of total students) \n2006-07 581 75 (12.9%) \n2007-08 552 78 (14.1%) \n2008-09 498 81 (16.3%) \n2009-10 529 78 (14.7%) \n2010-11 526 77 (14.6%) \n2011-12 528 81 (15.3%) \n2012-13 475 84 (17.7%) \n2013-14 453 64 (14.1%) \n2014-15 472 76 (16.1%) \n2015-16 433 62 (14.4%) \nItem 5 - page 8\n5 \nOur proposal to suspend programs that have reasonably healthy enrolment numbers is \nbased on restructuring our departmental honors and specialization to provide fewer but \nmore cohesive and flexible programs. This streamlining of our programs specifically \neliminates programs that are taxonomic specific and/or reflect historical departmental \nboundaries (e.g., Zoology Department). The course requirements of these programs are \ncompletely captured within other programs, including the Ecology, Evolutionary Biology \nand Environmental Biology (newly proposed named for Ecology) and Integrative \nPhysiology (newly proposed name for Physiology and Developmental Biology) honors and \nspecialization programs. Finally, we will effectively use our websites to highlight and \nidentify course selections for students interested in animal biology within existing \nprograms. In sum, although the students will no longer have Animal Biology as part of \ntheir formal transcripts, there is no loss of the essence of these programs. The opportunity \nto take a focused breadth and depth of courses remains the same for these students. \n2. Anticipated impacts on students and graduates and plans to ameliorate these impacts.  \nDescribe the institution’s plan to teach-out active students and stop-outs.  Include evidence \nof consultation with students and a communications plan for informing stopped-out \nstudents of the change. \nCourses required in the suspended Animal Biology program will continue to be offered. \nEmphasis in Animal Biology was previously available in multiple programs and will still \nbe available to our students. Advisors will still be available to assist them with course \nselection.   \nAs summarized above, 75% of students surveyed (out of 554 respondents) indicated they \naccepted or were neutral about a reduction to three honors/specialization programs for the \nDepartment of Biological Sciences. \n3. Identify anticipated impacts on external stakeholders (e.g. employers, professional/ \nregulatory organizations, other post-secondary institutions) and provide evidence of \nconsultation. \nThere is no anticipated impact on professional or regulatory organizations because no \nprofessional, regulatory, or post-secondary institution requires or relies on credentials \nawarded to students through the Animal Biology programs. As the component courses of \nAnimal Biology will still be taught, employers can still seek out students with specific and \nrequired knowledge in this discipline. It is just that that student transcripts will no longer \nhave the Honors or Specialization in Animal Biology designations.  \nWe will notify individual students enrolled in the Animal Biology programs of the \nsuspension of the program and our continued commitment to providing them with \nassistance in completing their degrees.  We will post information on Departmental and \nItem 5 - page 9\n 6 \nFaculty of Science websites and other announcement venues about the suspension of the \nHonors and Specialization programs in Animal Biology. \nBecause all of our honors and specialization programs have a common first year (which is \nmaintained in the three newly renamed programs), the proposed suspension will not \nsignificantly affect other post-secondary institutions where students transfer in our \nprograms at the end of their first year. The requirements for year two in retained programs \nare very similar.  \nWe will not accept any enrolments into the suspended Animal Biology programs after the \napproved suspension date, which will be advertised in the University Calendar for one year \npreceding the change.  However, these programs will remain active for seven years to \nprovide students who may have taken a leave of absence or have approval for reduced \ncourse load sufficient time to complete the programs.  Once the seven-year period is over, \nthe suspended programs will no longer be active. \n4. Identify anticipated impacts on institutional operations and resources (e.g. operating \nbudget, staffing, student services, information technology, library, classroom and lab \nspace).  Discuss plans for the reallocation of any resources freed up by the proposed \nsuspension.   \nThere will be no impact on Departmental teaching resources because the courses offered in \nthese suspended programs will continue to be offered. We do not anticipate any impact on \nclass sizes and section numbers. In fact, enrolment is increasing in our departmental \ncourses likely due to recently changed requirements for the General Biological Sciences \nmajor.  \nThe Department of Biological Sciences, Faculty of Science, and University will revise \ndocuments under their control (e.g., websites, forms) to incorporate the suspension of \nAnimal Biology Programs.  We will undertake the formal changes necessary in the \nUniversity Calendar to reflect the suspensions. The suspensions would also impact the \nOffice of the Registrar, which would make necessary changes to first level specialization \ncodes. The costs associated with these changes fall into normal updating of University \nprograms, websites, and forms and will not result in any net new expenses for the \nUniversity.  \nB:  Reactivation \n1. Rationale for reactivation (for example, increased employer demand, student demand, new \nfunding sources, etc.).  Comment on the alignment of the proposed change with the \ninstitution’s strategic direction and priorities. \n2. Identify anticipated impacts on institutional operations and resources (e.g. operating \nbudget, staffing, student services, information technology, library, and classroom and lab \nspace). \nItem 5 - page 10\n7 \n3. Provide a simplified enrolment plan using the following table.  Include assumptions and \nexplanatory notes (e.g., attrition, part-time enrolment). \nProposed Enrolment Year 1 Year 2 Year 3 Year 4 Year 5 Annual Ongoing \nIntake (head count) 0 0 0 0 0 0 \nTotal head count 0 0 0 0 0 0 \nTotal FLE 0 0 0 0 0 0 \nAnticipated No. of Graduates 0 0 0 0 0 0 \nC:  Termination \n1. Describe measures taken by the institution to ensure that active students and stop-outs have \nhad ample opportunity to complete their programs of study. \n2. Where applicable, summarize the actual re-allocation of resources during the period of \nsuspension, and any additional re-allocation anticipated upon termination, and specify the \nimpacts of re-allocation on institutional operations.   \nItem 5 - page 11\n1 \nProposal Template: Program Suspension, Reactivation and \nTermination \nThis template is for the presentation of proposals for suspension or termination of an existing \nprogram or specialization within an existing program; and for reactivation of a suspended \nprogram or specialization. \nBasic Information \nInstitution  University of Alberta \nProgram/specialization title Bachelor of Science: \n(1) Specialization in Evolutionary Biology \n(2) Honors in Evolutionary Biology \nCredential awarded BSc \nProposed date(s) of suspension \nterm,  reactivation or termination \nJuly 1, 2017 - June 30, 2024 \nA:  Suspension \n1.

Emphasis in Evolutionary Biology was previously offered in multiple programs \nand will still be available to our students.  Advisors will still be available to assist them \nwith course selection.  All evolution specific courses were already captured in existing \nprograms.  In Ecology, Evolution, and Environmental Biology (proposed new name for the \ncurrent Ecology Programs), all courses currently required for the Evolutionary Biology \nprogram are now incorporated into newly arranged lists. Notably List D is entitled \nEvolution and Systematics, highlighting the integration of Ecology and Evolutionary \nBiology.  \n2. Anticipated impacts on students and graduates and plans to ameliorate these impacts.  \nDescribe the institution’s plan to teach out active students and stop-outs.  Include evidence \nof consultation with students and a communications plan for informing stopped-out \nstudents of the change. \nWe will notify individual students enrolled in the Evolutionary Biology programs of the \nsuspension of the program and our continued commitment to providing them with \nassistance in completing their degrees.  We will post information on Departmental and \nFaculty of Science websites and other announcement venues about the cancellation of the \nHonors and Specialization programs in Evolutionary Biology. \nAs summarized above, 75% of students surveyed (out of 554 respondents) indicated they \naccepted or were neutral about a reduction to three honors/specialization programs for the \nDepartment of Biological Sciences. \n3. Identify anticipated impacts on external stakeholders (e.g. employers, professional/ \nregulatory organizations, other post-secondary institutions) and provide evidence of \nconsultation. \nThere is no anticipated impact on professional or regulatory organizations because no \nprofessional, regulatory, or post-secondary institution requires or relies on credentials \nawarded to students through the Evolutionary Biology programs.  As the component \ncourses of Evolutionary Biology will still be taught, employers can still seek out students \nwith specific and required knowledge in Evolutionary Biology. It is just that that student \ntranscripts will no longer have the Honors or Specialization in Evolutionary Biology \ndesignations. \nBecause all of our honors and specialization programs have a common first year (which is \nmaintained in three newly renamed programs), the proposed suspension will not \nsignificantly affect other post-secondary institutions where students transfer in our \nprograms at the end of their first year. The requirements for year two in retained programs \nare similar.  \nWe will not accept any enrolments into the suspended Evolutionary Biology programs after \nthe approved suspension date, which will be advertised in the University Calendar for one \nItem 5 - page 16\n 6 \nyear preceding the change.  However, these programs will remain active for seven years to \nprovide students who may have taken a leave of absence or have approval for reduced \ncourse load sufficient time to complete the programs.  Once the seven-year period is over, \nthe suspended programs will no longer be active. \n4. Identify anticipated impacts on institutional operations and resources (e.g. operating \nbudget, staffing, student services, information technology, library, classroom and lab \nspace).  Discuss plans for the reallocation of any resources freed up by the proposed \nsuspension.   \nThere will be no impact on departmental teaching resources because the courses included \nin these programs will continue to be offered. We do not anticipate any affect on class sizes \nand section numbers. Enrolment is increasing in Biological Sciences courses despite the \ndearth of students enrolled in some programs, especially due to more rigorous requirements \nfor the General Biological Sciences major.  \nThe Department of Biological Sciences, Faculty of Science, and University will revise \ndocuments under their control (e.g., websites, forms) to incorporate the suspension of \nEvolutionary Biology Programs.  We will undertake the formal changes necessary in the \nUniversity Calendar to reflect the suspensions. The suspensions would also impact the \nOffice of the Registrar, which would make necessary changes to first level specialization \ncodes. The costs associated with these changes fall into normal updating of University \nprograms, websites, and forms and will not result in any net new expenses for the \nUniversity. \nB:  Reactivation \n1.

The proposed changes to consolidate our undergraduate honors \nand specialization programs will enhance undergraduate student experiences and more \naccurately communicate the breadth, strengths and focus of the Biological Sciences \nprograms. We are a large and diverse department that provides substantive experiential \nlearning, however the size of our department can pose challenges for undergraduate \nstudents trying to choose our programs or discern differences amongst the breadth of \ndisciplines. We currently offer seven honors and seven specialization programs, which \nmostly reflected outdated boundaries of departments that were merged into a larger \nBiological Sciences Department over 20 years ago. The proposed changes avoid taxonomic \n1 Please note that this section entitled “Summary of Suite of Program Changes in the Department of Biological” is repeated \nin seven documents submitted at same time: Animal Biology Suspension, Ecology Name Change, Evolutionary Biology \nSuspension, Microbiology Suspension, Molecular Genetics Name Change, Physiology and Developmental Biology Name \nChange, and Plant Biology Suspension. \nItem 5 - page 19\n 2 \ndesignations (e.g., Animal Biology, Plant Biology) and more appropriately reflect broader \nareas in Biological Sciences, rather than revolve content around specific organisms that \nmay be used to study these important disciplines. The outcome of this re-evaluation is a \nreduction in our total number of programs, while still providing students with an exemplary \neducation that reflects appropriate depth and breadth to meet the challenges of changing \nand broad career opportunities in the Biological Sciences. \nThe set of Program Name Changes and Program Suspension submitted reflects this \ndepartmental-wide consolidation of seven honors/specialization programs (Animal \nBiology, Ecology, Evolutionary Biology, Molecular Genetics, Microbiology, Physiology \nand Developmental Biology, and Plant Biology) to three:  \n(1) Ecology, Evolution and Environmental Biology (newly proposed name for Ecology); \n(2) Integrative Physiology (newly proposed name for Physiology and Developmental \nBiology); and \n(3) Molecular, Cellular and Developmental Biology (newly proposed name for Molecular \nGenetics). \nSimultaneously, we propose to suspend the following honors/specialization programs: \n(1) Animal Biology \n(2) Evolutionary Biology \n(3) Microbiology \n(4) Plant Biology \nWe are not proposing changes to either of our joint programs: (1) Immunology and \nInfection (joint with Medical Microbiology and Immunology) or (2) Paleontology (joint \nwith Department of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences).  Nor are we proposing any changes \nto the General Biological Sciences Major. \nThese changes result in programs that have broad appeal, provide greater flexibility, and \naccurately describe program learning outcomes and content.  We are not changing the core \nrequirements of any of the three newly named programs but rather highlighting expanded \nlistings of course choices to meet the learning outcomes of the programs. All programs \ncontinue to share a common set of first year course requirements.  \nAll students in suspended programs will be given the opportunity to complete their \nprograms. For those students who are interested in these suspended programs, all of them \nare fully captured in the three renamed programs. Depending on interests, there is one of \nthe newly named programs that is a natural fit, for others, there may be more than one of \nthe newly named programs that would work. For example, Evolutionary Biology has \nalways been an integral part of the Ecology program. Similarly, Microbiology and Plant \nBiology courses were incorporated into and remain key to our Molecular, Cellular and \nDevelopmental Biology Programs (newly proposed name for Molecular Genetics \nPrograms). Students interested in the Plant Biology and Microbiology programs will just as \neasily fit in the Ecology, Evolution and Environmental Biology Programs (newly proposed \nname for Ecology Programs) if they are more interested how these organisms evolve and \ninteract in their environment than their molecular basis. Along these veins, all three newly \nItem 5 - page 20\n3 \nnamed programs would fulfill goals of students interested in Animal Biology, depending on \nwhether they wanted to focus on their physiology, their ecology and evolution, or their \nmolecular and cellular processes.  \nThis consolidation of programs also permits students to explore more of the large and \ndiverse Department of Biological Sciences offerings. If they discover an unexpected \ninterest (ie, genetics students discovering love for plant biology), they are now able to more \neasily take additional courses in that area without having to formally change programs. \nSwitching programs often results in students taking an extra term or extra year to complete \nrequirements. Similarly, students who have identified and maintain a particular fascination \n(e.g., animal biology) will have the direction to take classes that provide substantial depth \nof knowledge in that discipline. The consolidated course listings within the three renamed \nprograms makes them less restrictive for undergraduate students, thus taking perhaps \noverly complicated programs to ones that provide more choice. The learning outcomes, \ncore requirements, rigor, depth, and excellence of our programs remain the same.  \nFurther, the newly structured programs maintain and increase the flexibility for students to \nparticipate in the Science Internship Program (SIP) and/or completion of the Research \nCertificate in Science (Biological Sciences). These two opportunities are aligned with the \nUniversity of Alberta’s new Institutional Strategic Plan “For the Public Good” that sets out \nto increase access to internships and support for excellence in teaching, particularly \nexperiential learning, as objectives. \nThis restructuring was initiated at a Department of Biological Sciences Executive Retreat \nin November 2014, wherein we challenged ourselves to reexamine our undergraduate \nprograms as though they were new rather than products of historical departments. The \nproposed restructuring was then discussed and/or voted on at three departmental council \nmeetings (15 April 2015, 9 December 2015, 10 February 2016).  Further, we facilitated \ndepartment-wide discussion of changes via two avenues. First, we developed a \ndepartmental website that included our student survey (see below) and proposed changes to \nour programs. Second, we coordinated three informal meetings to which our invested \nstakeholders attended and discussed changes to our newly named programs (30 November \n2015, 1 December 2015, 4 December 2015).  \nImportantly, students also support this restructuring. In March 2015, we conducted an \nanonymous online survey of our Biological Sciences students. We also led three focal \nmeetings with groups of students including students registered in our honors/specialization \nprograms and in the general program (two on 27 March 2015, one on 30 March 2015). Of \nthe 554 respondents to the online survey, 192 were in our honor/specialization programs (= \n44% of total students enrolled in the honors/specialization programs) and 353 were in the \nGeneral Biological Sciences Program (= 23% of the total number of students in the General \nProgram). The majority of these respondents (71%) stated that our seven \nhonors/specialization programs have limited (which allowed us to determine which \nprograms to maintain) and strong (which allowed us to determine which programs to \nsuspend) overlap. Similarly, students indicated that having three honors/specialization \nItem 5 - page 21\n 4 \nprograms versus seven was acceptable (29%), slightly acceptable (26%), neutral (20%), \nslightly unacceptable (18%), and unacceptable (7%).  In sum, 75% of the students surveyed \neither accepted or were neutral about the consolidation to three honors/specialization \nprograms. A few comments regarding these changes are provided here: \n● “I actually quite like the idea of three overarching areas of study. It makes decision-\nmaking easier and less overwhelming while still maintaining the aspect of choice.” \n● “It is confusing distinguishing between the many different programs.” \n● “It can be a little bit overwhelming differentiating between all of the programs.” \n● “There is so much overlap between all of the biological sciences programs – \nespecially between different ‘animal related’/‘plant’/‘ecology’ related programs that \neven though there are quite a few different programs offered, the overlap effectively \nreduces the number of programs offered because they’re all so similar.” \n● “I feel as though the programs that exist are not easily understandable.” \nConversely, a small minority opinion is that the focus of seven programs provides \nappropriate depth for students who have a passion in one of these areas (e.g., Microbiology, \nPlant Biology). We greatly appreciate these concerns and will ameliorate them in three \nways. First, we will effectively use our departmental website to help students choose \ncourses that meet degree requirements and emphasize particular subdisciplines by \nidentifying informal streams within newly named programs. Second, we will maintain our \nset of faculty advisors who can actively help students identify interests and understand \nappropriate course sequences to achieve their academic goals. Finally, we are not changing \nour course offerings, such that with few minor exceptions all of our current courses are still \navailable to our students. In other words, all newly named programs accommodate these \ninterests. \nRationale for suspension of Microbiology Programs \nTo generate, broader and more flexible programs, we propose to suspend the honors and \nspecialization programs in Microbiology.  Historically, enrollment in the honors and \nspecialization Microbiology programs have been 50-60 students/year: \nAcademic \nYear \nTotal number of students \nregistered in our \nhonors/specialization \nprograms \nNumber of students enrolled in Honors and \nSpecialization Microbiology Programs \n(percentage of total students) \n2006-07 581 56 (9.6%) \n2007-08 552 55 (10%) \n2008-09 498 40 (8%) \n2009-10 529 55 (10.4%) \n2010-11 526 50 (9.5%) \n2011-12 528 55 (10.4%) \n2012-13 475 47 (10%) \n2013-14 453 48 (10.6%) \n2014-15 472 57 (12.1%) \nItem 5 - page 22\n5 \n2015-16 433 43 (9.9%) \nNote that the enrolment for these programs was reported under the General Biological \nSciences Program and this specialization was terminated erroneously in 2012. A \nreactivation proposal has also been submitted to ensure that students who received a BSc in \nBiological Science - Microbiology, have recognized credentials.  However, due to the \nrestructuring of departmental honors and specializations, the Microbiology program will be \nsuspended.   \nThis streamlining of our programs specifically eliminates programs that are taxonomic \nspecific and/or reflect historical departmental boundaries (e.g., Microbiology Department). \nThe course requirements of these programs are completely captured in our renamed \nprograms. Specifically the Molecular, Cellular and Developmental Biology honors and \nspecialization programs (proposed new name for our current Molecular Genetics programs) \nallow students to specialize in Microbiology-specific courses during their 3rd and 4th years.  \nFinally, due to recent attrition in microbiology faculty and absence of filling these \npositions, we are not currently able to offer some upper division MICRB courses required \nfor the Honors Microbiology program. Although these courses are required for the \nMicrobiology honors programs, they are incorporated into other programs as part of large \nlists of optional courses, such that our inability to offer these courses only impacts the \nHonors Microbiology program. Thus, we leveraged that microbiology has always been \nintegral to the genetics program, so the microbiology courses in that program will be \nstrengthened. Further, microbiology courses are integral components of newly revised lists \nin the Ecology, Evolution, and Environmental Biology (newly proposed name for our \nEcology Programs) lists A-D, reflecting the importance of this field that was already \ncaptured in these Programs. \n2. Anticipated impacts on students and graduates and plans to ameliorate these impacts.  \nDescribe the institution’s plan to teach out active students and stop-outs.  Include evidence \nof consultation with students and a communications plan for informing stopped-out \nstudents of the change. \nThe courses required for the Microbiology program will be maintained and we will \ncontinue to offer them as outlined in the University Calendar.

Advisors will still be available to assist them with course \nselection. We will post information on Departmental and Faculty of Science websites and \nItem 5 - page 23\n 6 \nother announcement venues about the cancellation of the Honors and Specialization \nprograms in Microbiology. \nAs summarized above, 75% of students surveyed (out of 554 respondents) indicated they \naccepted or were neutral about a reduction to three honors/specialization programs for the \nDepartment of Biological Sciences. \n3. Identify anticipated impacts on external stakeholders (e.g. employers, professional/ \nregulatory organizations, other post-secondary institutions) and provide evidence of \nconsultation. \nThere is no anticipated impact on professional or regulatory organizations because no \nprofessional, regulatory, or post-secondary institution requires or relies on credentials \nawarded to students through the Microbiology programs.

In other words, all newly named programs accommodate these \ninterests. \nRationale for suspending Plant Biology Programs \nThe proposed suspension of the Plant Biology Honors and Specialization programs will \ngenerate, broader and more flexible programs.  Historically, these programs have had low \nenrolment at circa 10 students/year: \nAcademic \nYear \nTotal number of \nstudents registered in \nour \nhonors/specialization \nprograms \nNumber of students \nenrolled in Honors and \nSpecialization Plant \nBiology Programs \n(percentage of total \nstudents) \n2006-07 581 8 (1.4%) \n2007-08 552 7 (1.3%) \n2008-09 498 5 (1%) \n2009-10 529 8 (1.5%) \n2010-11 526 9 (1.7%) \n2011-12 528 8 (1.5%) \n2012-13 475 5 (1.1%) \n2013-14 453 6 (1.3%) \nItem 5 - page 29\n5 \n2014-15 472 7 (1.5%) \n2015-16 433 6 (1.4%) \nNote that there is no record in PaPRS for Plant Biology and enrolment for this \nspecialization was historically reported under the General Biological Sciences Major. A \nnew specialization proposal was submitted to ensure that students who received a BSc in \nBiological Science - Plant Biology, have recognized credentials.  However, due to the \nrestructuring of departmental honors and specializations, the Plant Biology program will be \nsuspended.   \nOur courses required for this program will be maintained and we will continue to offer \nthem as outlined in the University Calendar. In contrast to student enrollments in the Plant \nBiology programs, enrollment and demand has increased for our Botany courses.  \nEmphasis on Plant Biology will still be available to our students interested in this field.  All \nPlant Biology specific courses were already captured in existing programs, although they \nhave been highlighted differently in the restructuring.  In Ecology, Evolution, and \nEnvironmental Biology (proposed new name for current Ecology Programs), all courses \ncurrently required for Plant Biology are listed in List A (Biological Diversity; e.g., BOT \n321 Flowering Plants), List B (Biological Processes; e.g., BOT 308 Plant Anatomy), List C \n(Ecology and Environmental Biology; e.g., BOT 332, Plant Ecology). It is important to \nnote that these courses were always an integral component of the Ecology program. \nSimilarly, a Plant Biology focus is now laid out in course options in the revised Molecular, \nCellular and Developmental Biology program (proposed new name for our current \nMolecular Genetics program).  The ability to focus on molecular plant sciences has been \nadded and emphasized there. \n2. Anticipated impacts on students and graduates and plans to ameliorate these impacts.  \nDescribe the institution’s plan to teach out active students and stop-outs.  Include evidence \nof consultation with students and a communications plan for informing stopped-out \nstudents of the change. \nAll students currently in the Honors and Specialization Plant Biology programs will be \nprovided the opportunity to complete their programs in Biological Sciences. The individual \ncourses that make up the Plant Biology programs will continue to be offered for the \nforeseeable future. Advisors will still be available to assist them with course selection.  We \nwill notify individual students enrolled in the Plant Biology programs of the suspension of \nthe program and our continued commitment to providing them with assistance in \ncompleting their degrees.  We will post information on departmental and Faculty of \nScience websites and other announcement venues about the cancellation of the Honors and \nSpecialization programs in Plant Biology.  \nItem 5 - page 30\n 6 \nAs summarized above, 75% of students surveyed (out of 554 respondents) indicated they \naccepted or were neutral about a reduction to three honors/specialization programs for the \nDepartment of Biological Sciences. \n3. Identify anticipated impacts on external stakeholders (e.g. employers, professional/ \nregulatory organizations, other post-secondary institutions) and provide evidence of \nconsultation. \nThere is no anticipated impact on professional or regulatory organizations because no \nprofessional, regulatory, or post-secondary institution requires or relies on credentials \nawarded to students through the Plant Biology programs.  As the component courses of \nPlant Biology will still be taught, employers can still seek out students with specific and \nrequired knowledge in Plant Biology. It is just that that student transcripts will no longer \nhave the Honors or Specialization in Plant Biology designations. \nBecause all of our honors and specialization programs have a common first year, the \nproposed suspension will not significantly affect other post-secondary institutions where \nstudents transfer into our programs at the end of their first year. The requirements for year \ntwo in renamed programs are similar.  \nWe will not accept any enrolments into the suspended Plant Biology programs after the \napproved suspension date, which will be advertised in the University Calendar for one year \npreceding that date. However, these programs will remain active for seven years to provide \nstudents who may have taken a leave of absence or have approval for reduced course load \nsufficient time to complete the programs.  Once the seven-year period is over, the \nsuspended programs will no longer be active. \n4. Identify anticipated impacts on institutional operations and resources (e.g. operating \nbudget, staffing, student services, information technology, library, classroom and lab \nspace).  Discuss plans for the reallocation of any resources freed up by the proposed \nsuspension.   \nThere will be no impact on departmental teaching resources because the courses included \nin these programs will continue to be offered. We do not anticipate course sizes to be \nimpacted by these changes. Enrollment is increasing in courses despite the dearth of \nstudents enrolled in program. These courses count towards the General Biological Sciences \nmajor, which make up a substantial portion of students enrolled in our courses. This change \nin program will not impact students enrolled in the Major Teaching Subject in the \nSecondary Education Route, Biological Sciences, which requires students to take BOT 205, \nFundamentals of Plant Biology. We will continue to offer this course.  \nThe Department of Biological Sciences, Faculty of Science, and University will revise \ndocuments under their control (e.g., websites, forms) to incorporate the suspension of Plant \nBiology Programs.  We will undertake the formal changes necessary in the University \nCalendar to reflect these suspensions. The suspensions would also impact the Office of the \nRegistrar, which would make necessary changes to first level specialization codes. The \ncosts associated with these changes fall into normal updating of University programs, \nwebsites, and forms and will not result in any net new expenses for the University. \nItem 5 - page 31\n7 \nB:  Reactivation \n1. Rationale for reactivation (for example, increased employer demand, student demand, new \nfunding sources, etc.).  Comment on the alignment of the proposed change with the \ninstitution’s strategic direction and priorities. \n2. Identify anticipated impacts on institutional operations and resources (e.g. operating \nbudget, staffing, student services, information technology, library, and classroom and lab \nspace). \n3. Provide a simplified enrolment plan using the following table.  Include assumptions and \nexplanatory notes (e.g., attrition, part-time enrolment). \nProposed Enrolment Year 1 Year 2 Year 3 Year 4 Year 5 Annual Ongoing \nIntake (head count) 0 0 0 0 0 0 \nTotal head count 0 0 0 0 0 0 \nTotal FLE 0 0 0 0 0 0 \nAnticipated No. of Graduates 0 0 0 0 0 0 \nC:  Termination \n1.

Where applicable, summarize the actual re-allocation of resources during the period of \nsuspension, and any additional re-allocation anticipated upon termination, and specify the \nimpacts of re-allocation on institutional operations.   \nItem 5 - page 32\n1 \nBiological Sciences  \nProgram Changes \nCURRENT PROPOSE  \nFaculty Overview \nThe Faculty of Science offers degrees in Applied \nMathematics, Atmospheric Sciences, Astrophysics, \nBiochemistry, Biological Sciences (Animal Biology, \nEcology, Evolutionary Biology, Microbiology, \nMolecular Genetics, Physiology and \nDevelopmental Biology, Plant Biology), Chemistry, \nCell Biology, Computing Science, Computing \nScience with Business Minor, Environmental Earth \nSciences, Geology, Geophysics, Immunology and \nInfection, Mathematical Physics, Mathematics, \nMathematics (Computational Science) \nMathematics and Economics, Mathematics and \nFinance, Neuroscience, Paleontology, \nPharmacology, Physics, Physiology, Psychology, \nand Statistics.  \nA Business Minor, an Arts Minor and an \nAgricultural, Life and Environmental Sciences \nminor are available in the BSc General program.  \nA Science Internship Program (SIP) is available to \nFaculty of Science BSc students to enhance their \nstudies and provide relevant work experience. \nStudents must complete an 8-, 12- or 16- month \nwork experience term at the end of their third year \nto receive SIP designation on their degree \nparchment.

The General \nAcademic Standing Requirements have been added to the Calendar with \na minimum cumulative GPA of 3.0 and the allowance of only one failed \ncourse. \nThe Impact of the Proposal is For the admission GPA calculation a solid foundation in anatomy is key \nto understanding human movement and the pathological processes that \ncould arise as a result of disease or injury. The advanced anatomy \ncourse covered in the MScPT program is intensive and requires good \nfoundational knowledge for students admitted to the program. To \nfacilitate student success in the MScPT anatomy course, we believe \nrecency of knowledge is important as is a good understanding of the \nmaterial. Therefore we propose a change to require that anatomy be \ncompleted in the previous 5 years. For many students anatomy does not \nfall within their most recent 60 credits, we believe that students may work \nharder to learn and understand the content if it is specifically weighted in \nthe GPA calculation. \nFor the addition of the General Academic Standing Requirements \nsection, FGSR requires programs that have higher minimum cumulative \ngrade point average compared to FGSR’s minimum to provide this in the \ncalendar. \nReplaces/Revises (eg, policies, \nresolutions) \nn/a \nTimeline/Implementation Date 2017-2018 Calendar for students admitted in 2018. \nEstimated Cost and funding \nsource \nn/a \nItem 6 - page 1\nItem No. 6 \nGFC ACADEMIC STANDARDS COMMITTEE \nFor the Meeting of October 20, 2016 \nNext Steps (ie.: \nCommunications Plan, \nImplementation plans) \n<Please provide details about the next steps for the proposal> \nSupplementary Notes and \ncontext \nn/a \nEngagement and Routing (Include meeting dates) \nParticipation: \n(parties who have seen the \nproposal and in what capacity) \n<For further information see \nthe link posted on \nthe Governance Toolkit section \nStudent Participation Protocol> \nThose who have been informed: \n• Faculty of Graduate Studies and Research Council—September \n14, 2016 \nThose who have been consulted: \n•  \nThose who are actively participating: \n•  \nApproval Route (Governance) \n(including meeting dates) \nRehabilitation Medicine Executive Committee—May 19, 2016 \nFinal Approver GFC Academic Standards Committee—October 20, 2016 \nAlignment/Compliance \nAlignment with Guiding \nDocuments \nGOAL: EXPERIENCE…opening doors to a lifetime of learning \nexperiences. \nOBJECTIVE 10: Expand access to and engagement in the University of \nAlberta for learners engaging in continuing and professional education \nprograms, experiences, and lifelong learning activities. \nStrategy i: Develop continuing and professional education programs that \nconnect the knowledge-mobilization activities of the university’s faculty \nmembers to the needs of diverse learner communities. \nStrategy ii: Create a wide range of opportunities, both in person and \nvirtual, for broad, learning-centred programs for alumni and other \ncommunities of learners engaging in continuing and professional \neducation. \nCompliance with Legislation, \nPolicy and/or Procedure \nRelevant to the Proposal \n(please quote legislation and \ninclude identifying section \nnumbers) \n1. Post-Secondary Learning Act (PSLA): The PSLA gives GFC \nresponsibility, subject to the authority of the Board of Governors, over \nacademic affairs (Section 26(1)). Further, the PSLA gives the Board of \nGovernors authority over certain admission requirements and rules \nrespecting enrolment (Section 60(1)(c) and (d)). The Board has \ndelegated its authority over admissions requirements and rules \nrespecting enrolment to GFC. GFC has thus established an Academic \nStandards Committee (ASC). \n2. PSLA: The PSLA gives Faculty Councils power to “provide for the \nadmission of students to the faculty” (29(1)(c)). \n3. UAPPOL Admissions Policy: “Admission to the University of Alberta \nis based on documented academic criteria established by individual \nItem 6 - page 2\nhttp://www.governance.ualberta.ca/GovernanceToolkit/Toolkit.aspx\nhttp://www.governance.ualberta.ca/GovernanceToolkit/Toolkit.aspx\nItem No. 6 \nGFC ACADEMIC STANDARDS COMMITTEE \nFor the Meeting of October 20, 2016 \nFaculties and approved by GFC. This criteria may be defined in areas \nsuch as subject requirements, minimum entrance averages, and \nlanguage proficiency requirements. In addition to academic requirements \nfor admission, GFC authorizes each Faculty to establish such other \nreasonable criteria for admission of applicants as the Faculty may \nconsider appropriate to its programs of study, subject to the approval of \nGFC (e.g. interview, audition, portfolio, etc.) \nThe admission requirements for any Faculty will be those approved by \nGFC as set forth in the current edition of the University Calendar. In \naddition to the admission requirements, selection criteria for quota \nprograms, where they exist, will also be published in the current edition \nof the University Calendar. The responsibility for admission decisions will \nbe vested in the Faculty Admission Committees or in the Deans of the \nrespective Faculties, as the councils of such Faculties will determine.” \n2. UAPPOL Admissions Procedure: \n“PROCEDURE \n1. EFFECTIVE DATE OF CHANGES TO ADMISSION REGULATIONS \nFollowing approval by GFC: \na. Where changes to admission regulations may disadvantage students \nin the current admission cycle, normally implementation will be \neffective after the change has been published in the University \nCalendar for one full year (i.e., effective the second year that the \ninformation is published in the University Calendar). \nFor example, a change approved in May 2005 would be first published in \nthe 2006-2007 University Calendar in March 2006. Therefore the \nstatement cannot come into effect until September 2007 (affecting \napplicants who apply for the September 2007 term beginning July 2006). \nb. Where changes to admission regulations are deemed by the \napproving body to be ‘advantageous to students’, normally the date of \nimplementation will be effective immediately or at the next available \nintake for the admitting Faculty.” \n5. PSLA: The PSLA gives Faculty Councils the authority to “determine \nthe conditions under which a student must withdraw from or may \ncontinue the student’s program of studies in a faculty” (Section \n29(1)(d)). \n6. UAPPOL Academic Standing Policy: All current academic standing \nregulations, including academic standing categories, University \ngraduating standards and requirements for all individual programs will \nbe those prescribed by Faculty Councils and GFC as set forth in the \nUniversity Calendar. \n7.

To facilitate student success in the MScPT anatomy \ncourse, we believe recency of knowledge is important as is a good understanding of the material. Therefore \nwe propose a change to require that anatomy be completed in the previous 5 years. For many students \nanatomy does not fall within their most recent 60 credits, we believe that students may work harder to \nlearn and understand the content if it is specifically weighted in the GPA calculation.] \nJustification for the addition of the General Academic Standing Requirements section: FGSR requires \nprograms that have higher minimum cumulative grade point average compared to FGSR’s minimum to \nprovide this in the calendar.   \nApproved: Rehabilitation Medicine Executive Committee, May 19, 2016 \nItem 6 - page 9\nItem No. 7 \nGFC ACADEMIC STANDARDS COMMITTEE \nFor the Meeting of October 20, 2016 \nOUTLINE OF ISSUE \nAction Item \nAgenda Title:  Proposed Changes to Admission and Academic Regulation, BSc Program in Medical \nLaboratory Science, Faculty of Medicine and Dentistry \nMotion:  THAT the GFC Academic Standards Committee approve, with delegated authority from General \nFaculties Council, the proposed changes to the admission and academic regulations, BSc Program in \nMedical Laboratory Science, as proposed by the Faculty of Medicine and Dentistry, and as set forth in \nAttachment 1, to take effect for Fall 2017. \nItem   \nAction Requested Approval Recommendation   \nProposed by Fraser Brenneis, Vice-Dean Education, Faculty of Medicine and \nDentistry \nPresenter Fraser Brenneis, Vice-Dean Education, Faculty of Medicine and \nDentistry \nDetails \nResponsibility Provost and Vice-President (Academic) \nThe Purpose of the Proposal is \n(please be specific) \nTo clarify the selection process as well as the academic and professional \nexpectation of learners enrolled in the MLS programs and align wording \nwith that of the University Calendar.

Post-Secondary Learning Act (PSLA): The PSLA gives GFC \nresponsibility, subject to the authority of the Board of Governors, over \nacademic affairs. Further, the PSLA gives the Board of Governors \nauthority over certain admission requirements and rules respecting \nenrolment. The Board has delegated its authority over admissions \nrequirements and rules respecting enrolment to GFC and GFC ASC. \n(Sections 26(1), 60(1)(c) and (d)). \n2.

ASC will consult as necessary with the Faculties \nand with other individuals and offices in its consideration of these \nproposals.” \nItem 7 - page 2\nhttp://www.governance.ualberta.ca/GovernanceToolkit/Toolkit.aspx\nhttp://www.governance.ualberta.ca/GovernanceToolkit/Toolkit.aspx\nItem No. 7 \nGFC ACADEMIC STANDARDS COMMITTEE \nFor the Meeting of October 20, 2016 \n3. PSLA: The PSLA gives Faculty Councils power to “provide for the \nadmission of students to the faculty” (29(1)(c)). \n4. UAPPOL Admissions Policy:  \n“Admission to the University of Alberta is based on documented \nacademic criteria established by individual Faculties and approved by \nGFC. This criteria may be defined in areas such as subject \nrequirements, minimum entrance averages, and language proficiency \nrequirements. In addition to academic requirements for admission, GFC \nauthorizes each Faculty to establish such other reasonable criteria for \nadmission of applicants as the Faculty may consider appropriate to its \nprograms of study, subject to the approval of GFC (e.g. interview, \naudition, portfolio, etc.). \nThe admission requirements for any Faculty will be those approved by \nGFC as set forth in the current edition of the University Calendar. In \naddition to the admission requirements, selection criteria for quota \nprograms, where they exist, will also be published in the current edition \nof the University Calendar. The responsibility for admission decisions will \nbe vested in the Faculty Admission Committees or in the Deans of the \nrespective Faculties, as the councils of such Faculties will determine.” \n5. UAPPOL Admissions Procedure: \n“PROCEDURE \n1. EFFECTIVE DATE OF CHANGES TO ADMISSION REGULATIONS \nFollowing approval by GFC: \na. Where changes to admission regulations may disadvantage \nstudents in the current admission cycle, normally implementation will be \neffective after the change has been published in the University Calendar \nfor one full year (I.e., effective the second year that the information is \npublished in the University Calendar). For example, a change approved \nin May 2005 would be first published in the 2006-2007 University \nCalendar in March 2006. Therefore the statement cannot come into \neffect until September 2007 (affecting applicants who apply for the \nSeptember 2007 term beginning July 2006). \nb. Where changes to admission regulations are deemed by the \napproving body to be ‘advantageous to students’, normally the date of \nimplementation will be effective immediately or at the next available \nintake for the admitting Faculty.” \n6. PSLA: The PSLA gives Faculty Councils the authority to “determine \nthe conditions under which a student must withdraw from or may \ncontinue the student’s program of studies in a faculty” (Section 29(1)(d)). \n7. UAPPOL Academic Standing Policy:  \n“All current academic standing regulations, including academic standing \ncategories, University graduating standards and requirements for all \nindividual programs will be those prescribed by Faculty Councils and \nGFC as set forth in the University Calendar.” \n8. UAPPOL Academic Standing Regulations Procedures: \n “All proposed new academic standing regulations and changes to \nexisting academic standing regulations will be submitted by the Faculties \nItem 7 - page 3\nItem No. 7 \nGFC ACADEMIC STANDARDS COMMITTEE \nFor the Meeting of October 20, 2016 \nor the Administration to the Provost and Vice-President (Academic). \nFaculties will also submit to the Provost and Vice-President (Academic) \nany proposed changes to the use and/or computation of averages \nrelating to academic standing, including promotion and graduation. \nIf the Provost and Vice-President (Academic) determines the proposal to \nbe in good order, the proposal will be introduced to the appropriate \nUniversity governance process(es). In considering these proposals, \ngovernance bodies will consult as necessary with the Faculties and with \nother individuals and offices. \nNormally, changes become effective once they are approved by GFC or \nits delegate and are published in the University Calendar.” \nAttachments (each to be numbered 1 - 9) \n1.

Post-Secondary Learning Act (PSLA): The PSLA gives GFC \nresponsibility, subject to the authority of the Board of Governors, over \nacademic affairs. Further, the PSLA gives the Board of Governors \nauthority over certain admission requirements and rules respecting \nenrolment. The Board has delegated its authority over admissions \nrequirements and rules respecting enrolment to GFC and GFC ASC. \n(Sections 26(1), 60(1)(c) and (d)). \n2. GFC Academic Standards Committee Terms of Reference (3. \nMandate) \n“B. Admission and Transfer, Academic Standing, Marking and Grading, \nTerm Work, Examinations, International Baccalaureate (IB), Advanced \nPlacement (AP) \ni. All proposals from the from the Faculties or the Administration related \nto admission and transfer, to the academic standing of students, to \ninstitutional marking and grading policies and/or procedures and to term \nwork policies and procedures are submitted to the Provost and Vice-\nPresident (Academic) (or delegate) who chairs the GFC Academic \nStandards Committee. ASC will consult as necessary with the Faculties \nand with other individuals and offices in its consideration of these \nproposals.” \n3. PSLA: The PSLA gives Faculty Councils power to “provide for the \nadmission of students to the faculty” (29(1)(c)). \n4. UAPPOL Admissions Policy:  \n“Admission to the University of Alberta is based on documented \nacademic criteria established by individual Faculties and approved by \nGFC. This criteria may be defined in areas such as subject \nrequirements, minimum entrance averages, and language proficiency \nrequirements. In addition to academic requirements for admission, GFC \nauthorizes each Faculty to establish such other reasonable criteria for \nadmission of applicants as the Faculty may consider appropriate to its \nprograms of study, subject to the approval of GFC (e.g. interview, \naudition, portfolio, etc.). \nItem 8 - page 2\nItem No. 8 \nGFC ACADEMIC STANDARDS COMMITTEE \nFor the Meeting of October 20, 2016 \nThe admission requirements for any Faculty will be those approved by \nGFC as set forth in the current edition of the University Calendar. In \naddition to the admission requirements, selection criteria for quota \nprograms, where they exist, will also be published in the current edition \nof the University Calendar. The responsibility for admission decisions will \nbe vested in the Faculty Admission Committees or in the Deans of the \nrespective Faculties, as the councils of such Faculties will determine.” \n5. UAPPOL Admissions Procedure: \n“PROCEDURE \n1. EFFECTIVE DATE OF CHANGES TO ADMISSION REGULATIONS \nFollowing approval by GFC: \na. Where changes to admission regulations may disadvantage \nstudents in the current admission cycle, normally implementation will be \neffective after the change has been published in the University Calendar \nfor one full year (I.e., effective the second year that the information is \npublished in the University Calendar). For example, a change approved \nin May 2005 would be first published in the 2006-2007 University \nCalendar in March 2006. Therefore the statement cannot come into \neffect until September 2007 (affecting applicants who apply for the \nSeptember 2007 term beginning July 2006). \nb. Where changes to admission regulations are deemed by the \napproving body to be ‘advantageous to students’, normally the date of \nimplementation will be effective immediately or at the next available \nintake for the admitting Faculty.” \n6. PSLA: The PSLA gives Faculty Councils the authority to “determine \nthe conditions under which a student must withdraw from or may \ncontinue the student’s program of studies in a faculty” (Section 29(1)(d)). \n7. UAPPOL Academic Standing Policy:  \n“All current academic standing regulations, including academic standing \ncategories, University graduating standards and requirements for all \nindividual programs will be those prescribed by Faculty Councils and \nGFC as set forth in the University Calendar.” \n8. UAPPOL Academic Standing Regulations Procedures: \n “All proposed new academic standing regulations and changes to \nexisting academic standing regulations will be submitted by the Faculties \nor the Administration to the Provost and Vice-President (Academic). \nFaculties will also submit to the Provost and Vice-President (Academic) \nany proposed changes to the use and/or computation of averages \nrelating to academic standing, including promotion and graduation. \nIf the Provost and Vice-President (Academic) determines the proposal to \nbe in good order, the proposal will be introduced to the appropriate \nUniversity governance process(es). In considering these proposals, \ngovernance bodies will consult as necessary with the Faculties and with \nother individuals and offices. \nNormally, changes become effective once they are approved by GFC or \nits delegate and are published in the University Calendar.” \nItem 8 - page 3\nItem No. 8 \nGFC ACADEMIC STANDARDS COMMITTEE \nFor the Meeting of October 20, 2016 \nAttachments (each to be numbered 1 - <>) \n1.
