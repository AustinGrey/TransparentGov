Following the discussion, several terms were removed from consideration pending additional clarification.

            "Description": "Purpose of the Proposal: To review and discuss the Committee's Terms of Reference as part of the activities of the GFC Ad Hoc Committee on Academic Governance Including Delegated Authority. Discussion: The Chair introduced members of the GFC Ad Hoc Committee and noted that they would be visiting all of GFC’s Standing Committees this month in an effort to engage members in discussions about each Committee’s mandate, membership composition, and delegations of authority from GFC. Following this, members, led by Dr de Montigny and Ms Naylor, expressed several comments and questions in relation to UASC’s Terms of Reference, authority within UAPPOL procedures, membership, and larger questions relating to scope and impact. In regards to the member composition of UASC, members expressed support to add a member of a Faculty tasked with making award decisions to recognize the importance and relevance of operationalizing these awards at the Faculty level and to consider adding 2 more undergraduate student members, to ensure sufficient representation. During the lengthy discussion surrounding the mandate of the Committee, members noted that more clarity is required surrounding the strategic role the Committee has in reviewing and approving awards at the institution, and how the activities of the Committee support the Institutional Strategic Plan. It was suggested that perhaps any future institutional strategy around undergraduate financial support would help strengthen the scope of the Committee. In addition, members discussed the perception that the Committee currently only identifies spelling and grammar mistakes within terms, and that more could be done to utilize the expertise around the table to ensure that the awards align with institutional goals and provide students with impactful support. Members suggested that the Terms of Reference do not accurately reflect what the Committee has been doing or should be doing, and the wording of the Terms of Reference indicate that the Committee approves “awards”, when in reality, the Committee approves scholarships, bursaries, medals, and awards, all of which have separate definitions. There was discussion surrounding whether the Committee is the appropriate body to approve the minimum values of awards as well as the definition of a normal course load between Faculties, and that approving and establishing these items are separate functions altogether. It was noted that award terms have become so standardized that it is difficult to make strategic decisions about them. In addition, members sought clarification surrounding how donor wishes and compliance with institutional goals were determined, and the exact roles of Student Financial Support and the Office of Advancement in drafting these items. There was additional consideration relating to the process of approving graduate level awards, and whether the two separate approval processes could be combined in a meaningful, strategic manner. Members also suggested presenting an annual report to full GFC highlighting awards trends. The Chair thanked members for their comments.",

Authority \nThe Post-Secondary Learning Act gives General Faculties Council (GFC) responsibility, subject to the \nauthority of the Board of Governors, over “academic affairs” (section 26(1)) and “to make rules and \nregulations respecting academic awards” (section 26(1)(m)).  GFC delegates certain of these powers to \nits Undergraduate Awards and Scholarship Committee.  GFC has thus established an Undergraduate \nAwards and Scholarship Committee (GFC UASC), as set out below. \nThe complete wording of the section(s) of the Post-Secondary Learning Act, as referred to above, and \nany other related sections, should be checked in any instance where formal jurisdiction or delegation \nneeds to be determined. \n2. Composition of the Committee \nElected by GFC \nFive members from Categories A1.1 and A1.6 and their counterparts in A1.5 and A1.7 (EXEC 18 NOV \n1996) \nOne academic staff cross-representative from the Academic Standards Committee (ASC) \nTwo undergraduate students \nNon-voting Resource Members \nAssistant Registrar, Student Awards (EXEC 11 JAN 2010) \nDean of Students or delegate (EXEC 10 SEPT 2001) \nSenior Development Officer, Office of Development (EXEC 11 JAN 2010) (EXEC 04 OCT 2010) \n3. Mandate of the Committee \nGFC UASC has delegated authority from GFC to: \n1. approve new undergraduate awards; \n2. approve changes to any undergraduate student award already approved by GFC UASC; \n3. approve the minimum value of a major award for undergraduate students, and to review that \nvalue regularly; \n4. approve the minimum value of an undergraduate award administered by the Student Awards \nOffice, and to review that value regularly; (EXEC 05 MAY 2008) \n5. approve the definition of a full normal course load for purposes of awards where more than \none Faculty is involved; \n6. recommend to the GFC Executive Committee on any new policy or revisions to existing policy \ngoverning awards for undergraduate students; \n7. consider any proposal emanating from any member of the University community for changes \nto GFC undergraduate student awards policy, and where deemed appropriate by GFC UASC, \nrecommend changes to the GFC Executive Committee. \n1 \n4. Committee Procedures \nThe Student Awards Office is responsible for listing on the Awards website all approved awards that \nmeet the minimum value. (EXEC 08 SEP 2003) \n5. Additional Reporting Requirements \nThe GFC Executive Committee requested that the GFC UASC provide for information a copy of the \nundergraduate awards approved by GFC UASC (EXEC April 8, 2002, Minute 97). \nR:\\GO04 General Faculties Council - General\\PRO\\TER\\UND\\Undergraduate-Awards-and-Scholarships-Committee-Amended.doc \nApproved October 4, 2010 (EXEC) \n2 \n1 \nGFC AD HOC COMMITTEE ON ACADEMIC GOVERNANCE \nINCLUDING DELEGATED AUTHORITY \nAd hoc Committee on Academic Governance including Delegated Authority \nGuiding Principles \nIntroduction \nCharged, as it is, with making recommendations with regard to academic governance, the ad hoc \ncommittee began its work by identifying some of the core ‘guiding principles’ that should inform its \ndeliberations. \nWe understand ‘governance’ as the processes through which an organization defines and achieves its \nmandate. This includes making decisions with regard to the structures, policies, and practices of decision-\nmaking, the exercise of authority, and the mechanisms of accountability.   \nUniversity governance is multi-level and bicameral. Provincial legislation – the Post-Secondary Learning \nAct (PSLA) – sets the framework for university governance. At the institutional level, the PSLA prescribes \nthat UAlberta will have bicameral institutions of governance – that is, there are two governing bodies. The \nBoard of Governors (the Board) oversees the business affairs of the institution – from appointing the \nPresident, through to approving budgets, investment strategies, collective agreements, and long-range \nstrategic planning. The General Faculties Council (GFC) oversees ‘academic affairs’. \nTo understand the operations of the university, it is important to note the distinction between ‘governance’ \nand ‘administration’. While the Board and GFC set policies and establish broad directions for the institution, \nthe university’s senior executive team is responsible for administrative operations, including operational \npolicies and decisions. And this is replicated at the Faculty and Departmental levels across the university.  \nGood governance requires collegial practice at all levels including the Board, the executive and all \nmembers of the institution.  \nThis ad hoc committee’s mandate pertains to reviewing academic governance at the institutional level. \nThus, we are to remain focused on the operations of GFC and its standing committees (including the \ndelegation of authority from GFC, the mandate and structure of committees, and related matters). \nBut, as a matter of principle, we embrace a reasonably expansive understanding of ‘academic affairs’ and, \nthus, GFC’s mandate. We support the notion that GFC must have the capacity to defend its legitimate role \nwith regard to issues that exist at the boundary between governance and administration, as well as \nbetween Board and GFC responsibilities. We also support the notion that GFC should have early \nopportunities to influence strategic decisions and directions that are set by the Board or administration, but \nimpinge on academic affairs. \nGuiding Principles \nAs a committee, we are committed to the principles of ‘collegial academic governance’. These principles \ninclude: \n• A desire to build mutual understanding of common goals and shared purpose – operationalized in \nnumerous ways, including the adoption of an institutional strategic plan. \n• A commitment to inclusive and participatory governance decision-making.  \n• A desire to facilitate meaningful individual-level engagement in governance processes. \n• A commitment to openness, transparency, and respectful communication.  \n• A commitment to responsiveness, respect, and reciprocity between governing bodies and between \ngoverning bodies and university administration.  \nAd Hoc Committee on Academic Governance including Delegated Authority \nGuiding Principles \n2 \nFurther Guiding Elements \nGuided by these principles, we begin our deliberations in agreement on the following: \n• GFC must take seriously its responsibility for academic affairs, and commit to showing leadership\non emerging issues and serving as a forum for discussing and taking decisions in the interest of\nacademic freedom, and excellence in research, creativity, and teaching and learning.\n• While the standing Committees of GFC should have real power to make (or initiate) substantive\ndecisions, a commitment to regular and reciprocal communication should position GFC to ensure\nthat its members retain the capacity to bring significant issues to the floor of GFC for debate and\ndecision. Standing Committee chairs have a responsibility to identify issues that Standing\nCommittee members feel are deserving of discussion by full GFC.\n• The composition of GFC Standing Committees should reflect the principle of meaningful\nrepresentation of elected, appointed, and ex officio, and student, staff, and faculty membership.\n• While ensuring appropriate checks and balances are in place, appropriate consultations occur, and\ncompeting interests are always considered, GFC’s committee structure and decision making\nprocesses should be designed to ensure streamlined pathways for the consideration and, when\ndesired, approval of proposals flowing from Faculties and other units within the University.\n• Meetings of GFC must be conducted in a manner that encourages participation and engagement.\n• Members of GFC, whether they are elected, appointed, or ex officio, student, staff, or faculty,\nshould be encouraged to represent the interests of any ‘constituency’ with which they are affiliated,\nwhile also considering competing interests and striving to consider (and define) the broader\ninstitutional interest.\nThis overview of the ad hoc committee’s guiding principles is, in many ways, incomplete, but it reflects our \nstarting point for considering the many issues before us. \nEndorsed by General Faculties Council: \nNovember 21, 2016\n\tFinal-Agenda\n\tItem-4-New-Items-for-Approval\n\tItem-5-TOR-TOUR-UASC\n",
