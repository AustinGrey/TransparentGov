            "Description": "Discussion: Dean Costopoulos reported that the current procedure was approved when student groups were removed from the Code of Student Behaviour a few years ago and that it has no associated policy. He indicated that proposed policy suite would clarify the relationship between the university and student groups including whether the university wants to have a relationship, the nature of relationship, and how it is regulated. Recognized student groups have the privilege of booking space and using the university logo. Dean Costopoulos emphasized that the proposed policy suite includes obligations on both sides and is primarily concerned with risk to people and property. The committee discussed the time required for applications for student group events to be approved, that the Students’ Union and Graduate Students’ Association would be bound by this policy, how situations which contravene the policy or procedures would be handled, and risk to reputation.",

The University environment encourages the formation of different Student Groups. These groups may be \ndefined in a variety of ways, according to, for example, a shared program of study, a commitment to service, a \ncommon activity, philosophy or background or particular perspective. When considering a group’s application for \nRegistration, the University takes into account the group’s stated purposes, goals, activities, membership criteria and \nother attributes. The University desires to support the activities of Student Groups, but also recognizes the need to\nregulate them for the benefit of the groups themselves and the University community. When a Student Group is \nRecognized by the University, responsibilities and benefits result for both. \nWhen sponsoring or conducting a Student Group Event or Activity, Student Groups are also accountable to the \nUniversity for the conduct of their members and/or guests. While Student Group status is considered in this \nProcedure, complaints regarding the conduct of individual members of a group and their guests will be addressed \nunder the Code of Student Behaviour and/or through other University policies, procedures or other appropriate \nprocesses. \nPurpose\nTo outline the University’s processes for the administration of Student Groups. \nPROCEDURE\n1.
