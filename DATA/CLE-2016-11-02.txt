            "Description": "Purpose of the Proposal: For discussion. Discussion: Mr Rahman provided the committee with an overview of the document noting examples from other U15 institutions and arguments for and against having a dedicated teaching stream. During the discussion, a member noted that institutions define teaching stream in different ways which may include teaching only or teaching plus scholarship; and that it would be important to capture this within the document. Another member noted that the current FSO (Faculty Service Officer) model could be useful as a starting point as this model accommodates varying levels of teaching/research/service and that there are FEC documents in place to do this; it was also noted that the FSO category is a well-established and somewhat unique model. In addition, librarians are also involved in scholarly activity and research. A member noted that a more in-depth analysis of the issue was necessary. It was suggested that a chart to compare institutions be developed which could include teaching load, title progression, research expectations, and tenure. It was noted that the rationale and reasoning used to develop models in other institutions may not be available online and that the subcommittee should contact the relevant teaching centres directly. The committee discussed the dualistic approach which could result in the creation of a ‘second class’ of staff while not raising the teaching profile. Concern about restricting scholarship to that related to teaching and learning was expressed as was the importance of teachers staying current and making contributions in their field. A member noted the importance recognizing that individuals focus on different aspects of their professional career at different times. Mr Rahman agreed that the flexibility of the model was echoed by the subcommittee. Further feedback from the committee included: more detail required (motivators and drivers, issues trying to address, etc), executive summary, the need for crossover of ideas between teaching and research, recognition of teaching excellence in the tenure and promotion process, Mr Rahman thanked the committee for their input and indicated that he would take this back to the subcommittee and return to the committee with a revised version.",

While there are some similarities between the Canadian system and \nthe American one, it is safe to say that the American system is more stratified and strained than \nthe Canadian one. Therefore, particularly when looking at teaching outcomes, many of the \napparent downsides of hiring teaching-only stream faculty may actually be attributable to \nsystemic chronic-underfunding, rather than shortcomings of the individuals in these positions. \nFor instance, one study mentions that teaching-only faculty are less likely to have office hours on \ncampus, but then recounts a story about an instructor converting a utility closet to an office.1 \nCanadian universities are – generally speaking – facing less severe challenges and the issues that \nappear to plague American contingent instructors would likely be rather foreign to their \nCanadian counterparts.  \nAdditionally, there is lack of available longitudinal data on how student outcomes have changed \nbefore and after the establishment of teaching-stream. This makes conclusively proving that \nteaching-stream improves student outcomes challenging. However, there is a strong inductive \nargument that the introduction of tenure, with its benefits of job security and the potential for \npedagogical research, will have a positive impact on student outcomes. \nArguments against Teaching Stream: \nThere are a number of issues that arise when looking at the workability of implementing a \nteaching stream. Some of which are valuable questions to ask, while other others seem to flow \nfrom a philosophical aversion to teaching-intensive positions. A major challenge is, of course, \nhow to develop and implement a teaching-intensive tenure stream, and whether or not that \nstream should be fully integrated within the traditional tenure system, or rather if it should \nsomehow operate in a separate, yet parallel space. A Council of Ontario Universities (COU) \nreport argues that as long as teaching is valued, rightly or wrongly, less than research, integrating \nthese teaching-intensive roles into the standard tenure system will only perpetuate the bias \nagainst those focused primarily on teaching.2 While this concern appears somewhat valid, as this \nissue frequently comes up in interviews with teaching stream faculty, it is likely that \n1 Adrianna Kezar, “Examining Non-Tenure Track Faculty Perceptions of How Departmental Policies and Practices Shape Their \nPerformance and Ability to Create Student Learning at Four-Year Institutions,” Research in Higher Education 54, no. 5 (2013): \n587. \n2 Leslie Sanders, Teaching Stream Positions: Some Implications (Toronto, 2011). \n  2 \nnormalization of teaching-stream faculty, and the likely persistent salary differentiation should \nserve to partially ameliorate this problem.3  \nThe COU also implies that, somehow, a focus on teaching may erode the “robust culture of \ninquiry in undergraduate education” that should be present on campus.4 Of the many objections \nraised by those who oppose the introduction of teaching stream stream faculty, this one is \nperhaps the most problematic and persistent. Traditional discourses on the role and structure of \nthe university tend to assume a high degree of complementarity between research and teaching, \nand on many levels, this relationship appears natural and rational.5 However, the data on \nundergraduate education quality presents a more complicated picture. The majority of literature \nsuggests that there is no relationship between quality of research and quality of teaching, and \nfurther that both teaching and research intensive faculty are adequately equipped to provide \nstudents with both a broad base of knowledge and specific insights into their field.6The evolution \nand rising importance of research productivity at universities has created an incentive structure \nsuch that for academics employed in ‘traditional’ roles, research tends to take precedence over \nteaching and pedagogical research. The introduction of a teaching stream should help mediate \nthese competing interests, and create ‘space’ within a department for the furthering of teaching \nmethods (including scholarship of teaching) without negatively impacting the research \nproductivity of research-focused professors. Further, a more accurate predictor of student \nlearning outcomes seems to be an individual’s employment of certain teaching strategies – \nstrategies that are not, by any means, accessible only to research-focused academics.7  \nThere is also the issue of the overall research quality and prestige of an institution, as both are at \npotentially at risk if the professoriate becomes dominated by individuals not actively engaged in \ntraditional research. While this concern may be valid, there is no real way of addressing it \nwithout getting into a larger discussion about the root cause of this issue, university funding. If \nan institution is being faced with stagnant or shrinking budgets, while also facing growing \nenrollment, there is no way out of that predicament that does not involve making painful choices. \nFurther, it is unlikely that any major Canadian research institution (particularly U15) is intent on \ndecimating the number of research-focused academics at their school, so the concern about the \nerosion of prestige seems to be more of a straw man than a substantive concern.  \nThe majority of arguments offered against the creation of teaching stream position are offered by \ntwo specific subsets of the academic community. One group is the already privileged set of \nindividuals who have the benefit of tenure and therefore need not be particularly concerned about \n3 Susan Vajoczki et al., “Teaching-Stream Faculty in Ontario Universities The Higher Education Quality Council of Ontario” \n(2011): 36–37. \n4 Sanders, Teaching Stream Positions: Some Implications, 6. \n5 Ruth Neumann, “Perceptions of the Teaching-Research Nexus: A Framework for Analysis,” Higher Education 23, no. 2 (1992): \n159–171. \n6 J.

Wawrzynski, “Contingent Faculty as Teachers: What We Know; What We Need to Know,” American \nBehavioral Scientist 55, no. 11 (2011): 1501. \n  3 \ntheir job security, or ability to earn a stable, fair income.8 The other group are those who are \npresently employed in teaching-intensive roles but who would prefer to be employed in a more \n‘traditional’, i.e. research-intensive position.9 For them, they see the codification and \nformalization of teaching stream as detrimental, as these roles, viewed by some young academics \nas transitory, will increasingly become institutionalized and permanent. Both of these objections \nare problematic, as each group seems to presuppose that every individual within the academic \ncommunity has, or ought to have, ambitions to carry out intensive research. Obviously, this is not \nthe case, and there a number of instructors at other universities who have spoken to the fact that \nthey prefer and also enjoy teaching. In some cases, the creation of secure, teaching-intensive \npositions has even drawn professors from other universities, eager to extricate themselves from \nthe “publish-or-die” attitude of more traditional faculty appointments.10 Even for individuals \n‘stuck’ teaching, who would prefer to be employed in a position that involved a greater degree of \nresearch, the introduction of job security and retention incentives is most likely preferable to the \ntumultuous status-quo of being sessional or contract instructors.  \nThere is some literature that suggests that part-time instructors may negatively impact student \nlearning outcomes and retention.11 This concern comes from speculation that part-time faculty \nare less likely than their full-time, tenured colleagues to understand the campus culture, be \nfamiliar with services to support student success and be less willing to engage with students \noutside the classroom. If this is the case, and that in and of itself is questionable, it strengthens \nthe argument for the adoption of teaching-stream tenure positions, or other means of providing \njob security and a sense of belonging to contract faculty, as the provision of these benefits will \nlikely increase their connection to the institution and their investment in better understanding the \ncampus and associated services. A large body of research, which holds that job security and job \nperformance are positively correlated, supports this conclusion.12  A renewed incentive structure \nand reduced uncertainty makes these sort of productivity-enhancing investments worthwhile for \nthe affected instructors. A study of the impact of instructor status on teaching quality at a large \nCanadian university found that “there is not a strong correlation between research-focused and \nteaching-focused college instructors – both have effective and noneffective teachers within each \ngroup…instructors do not make a large difference to student achievement”.13 These findings \n8 For example, see: Sanders, Teaching Stream Positions: Some Implications. \n9 Lee Bessette, “The Teaching Track? Really?,” Inside Higher Ed, 2012, https://www.insidehighered.com/blogs/college-ready-\nwriting/teaching-track-really. \n10 James Bradshaw, “For a New Kind of Professor, Teaching Comes First,” The Globe and Mail, 2013, \nhttp://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/education/new-breed-of-university-faculty-puts-focus-on-teaching-over-\nresearch/article14117866/; Moira Farr, “For Teaching-Only Faculty, a Controversial Role,” University Affairs, 2008, \nhttp://www.universityaffairs.ca/features/feature-article/those-who-can-teach/. \n11 See: Timothy Schibik and Charles Harrington, “Caveat Emptor: Is There a Relationship between Part-Time Faculty Utilization \nand Student Learning Outcomes and Retention,” AIR Professional File no. 91 (2004): 2–10. \n12 a.

February (2009): 92. \n  4 \nsuggest that stated concern about teaching-intensive faculty eroding the quality of education is \nvastly overstated. In fact, there is some evidence that suggests teaching-intensive faculty can \nactually have a positive impact on the quality of education at the undergraduate level.  \nArguments for Teaching Stream: \nThere are a number of strong practical, as well as philosophical arguments for the adoption of \nsome form of teaching stream at the University of Alberta. Much of the recent scholarship on \nteaching quality has consistently found that there is either no difference in educational quality \nbetween tenured and contract instructors or, in some cases, that these non-tenured teachers \nactually improve student success and engagement. A study conducted at Northwestern \nUniversity found a statistically significant increase in both students’ grades and the likelihood of \nthem taking another class in a field if they took a class taught by an instructor rather than a \ntenure-track professor.14 While instructors at Northwestern do not have the benefit of formal \nteaching stream, Northwestern has pursued a policy of nurturing long-term, secure relationships \nwith their instructors. These are individuals “with benefits, career ladders and job security”– \nsomething which could be considered roughly, albeit imperfectly, analogous to tenure.15  \nAnother study that looked nationally at teaching methods in the United States found that full-\ntime faculty, regardless of whether or not they were tenured, were more likely than their part-\ntime counterparts to employ both learning (essays, presentations and peer assessment) and \nsubject (multiple choice exams, short answer exams) centered approaches to teaching, while \npart-time faculty was heavily reliant on only subject-centered evaluations.16 This finding led the \nresearchers to conclude that the most effective allocation of a university’s funds was to focus on \nensuring that contingent instructors were offered full-time positions, as by virtue of being full-\ntime, they were more likely to employ a broad, and constructive, array of evaluative methods.17It \nis worth noting here that there was no difference in the methods of research vs. teaching \nintensive faculty, suggesting that the nature of employment matters more than the individual’s \nfocus.  \nThere is a notable lack of research into the impact of teaching only or contingent faculty on \nlearning outcomes in Canada. The only econometrically sound study of instructor status and \nperceived educational quality was the aforementioned one which found no statistically-\n14 David Figlio, Morton Schapiro, and Kevin Soter, Are Tenure Track Professors Better Teachers?, NBER Working Paper Series \n(Cambridge, MA, 2013), http://www.nber.org/papers/w19406. \n15 Ibid., 9.David Figlio, “Sunday Dialogue: Academia’s Two Tracks,” The New York Times, 2013, \nhttp://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/17/opinion/sunday/sunday-dialogue-academias-two-tracks.html?_r=0. \n16 Baldwin and Wawrzynski, “Contingent Faculty as Teachers: What We Know; What We Need to Know,” 1494. \n17 Ibid., 1505. \n  5 \nsignificant relationship; however the authors did find that teaching-focused instructors received a \nnominally higher score when being assessed on perceived teaching effectiveness.18  \nTeaching Tenure – Policies and Protections  \nAmerican Examples:  \n• The American Association of University Professors (AAUP) has an appendix in a major \nreport on teaching stream initiatives which highlights the approaches that different US \nschools to instituting policies around this new category. Many of the schools listed are \npublically funded, and are therefore reasonable comparators. Most notably, the \nPennsylvania State University system has instituted a formal teacher tenure track, while \nthe University of California system has implemented a system wherein there is no formal \ntenure, but instructors are granted longer-term contracts and more equitable salaries and \nbenefits.  \n• Appendix can be found here: http://www.aaup.org/report/tenure-and-teaching-intensive-\nappointments  \nCanadian Examples:  \n• University of Manitoba: According to a cursory review of the 2010-2013 Collective \nBargaining Agreement it appears as though the university’s teaching-intensive positions \n(Instructor/Lecturer designation) are afforded the same benefits as traditional faculty, \nincluding the ability to accrue research leave and longer-term contracts. Their salaries, \nhowever, are prorated.  \n• University of Toronto – Lecturer and Senior Lecturer, permanent appointments  \n• York: Alternate-Stream Appointment  \n• Waterloo: Continuing Lecturer \n• Dalhousie, McMaster, UBC, SFU and the University of Regina all also have similar \nagreements in place with their instructors and contingent faculty. \nSecuring Institutional and Strategic Commitment  \nWhile the aforementioned schools appear to have created these new positions without excessive \npushback from faculty, there have been some exceptions, where existing faculty associations \nhave strongly pushed back against the creation of teaching stream stream positions – most \nnotably at the University of Ottawa and University of Windsor.19 While there is little information \navailable on the specific issues that faculty at these institutions raised, it is reasonable to assume \nthat they were similar to the general arguments against teaching tenure outlined above. If the \nUniversity of Alberta were to move forward on this issue, it would be critical to more closely \nexamine the processes that were used with success at York University, the University of Toronto \n18 Hoffmann and Oreopoulos, “Professor Qualities and Student Achievement,” 88. \n19 Farr, “For Teaching-Only Faculty, a Controversial Role.” \nhttp://www.aaup.org/report/tenure-and-teaching-intensive-appointments\nhttp://www.aaup.org/report/tenure-and-teaching-intensive-appointments\nhttps://www.google.ca/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&ved=0CBwQFjAAahUKEwiRkbnfx5rIAhUQRYgKHczcBLc&url=http%3A%2F%2Fumanitoba.ca%2Fadmin%2Fhuman_resources%2Fservices%2Fmedia%2FFinal_version_2010_2013_UMFA_Collective_Agreement.doc&usg=AFQjCNFH7hg6lZoYlenuTYS7U_tj_3SEJg&bvm=bv.103388427,d.cGU&cad=rja\n  6 \nand UBC. It would also be helpful to initiate conversations with the Students’ Unions at these \ninstitutions to determine how, if at all, they were included in these discussions.  \nThe Delphi Project on Changing Faculty and Student Success, located the University of \nSouthern California, has developed a number of resources designed at facilitating discussions \naround the role and status of teaching-intensive faculty members.20 This includes tracking the \npaths of successful attempts to address and change the role of these instructors on a number of \ncampuses in the United States. There are, however, no similar studies of Canadian institutions \nthat are readily available.  \nWorks Cited  \nBaldwin, R. G., and M. R.

Background\nExploring Teaching Tenure Stream at University of Alberta \nIn response to growing enrollment and shrinking per-student funding, universities are forced to be more \ncreative in how they allocate resources. A common response across North America has been the rapid \nexpansion of contract teaching positions, as opposed to the traditional research-teaching-service model \nof tenured positions. Individuals in these contract positions generally lack the job security, \ncompensation and benefits of their tenured or tenure-track counterparts. In 2014-15, there were 922 \ncontract academics at our institution; as the number of contract instructors continues to grow, failure to \naddress this issue creates a liability for the institution.  \nSome North American universities, including the University of Toronto, UBC, Waterloo and the \nPennsylvania State University system have recognized that contract staff represent a tremendous asset \nto the academy and have implemented programs alike tenure to assure these individuals job security, \nfair compensation and the ability to conduct research – usually on discipline-specific pedagogy. \nDepartments tend to employ these individuals to teach junior courses, reserving more advanced classes \nfor “traditional” academics.   \nThe disproportionate presence of contract faculty in introductory classes raises important questions \nabout the relationship between their precarious status and student learning outcomes. With respect to \nstudent learning, there are two distinct issues: the innate ability of contract staff to teach at the same \nlevel as their research-focused colleagues, and the institutional support lent to contract faculty to \nensure they are able to engage with and support their students. The majority of available data on \nstudent learning outcomes under the two classes of instructors suggests that there is no statistically \nsignificant difference in learning outcomes, and in some cases contract instructors may affect \nimprovement in students’ performance in later classes in the same discipline.  Hence, creating \npermanent, secure positions for these instructors would not be detrimental, and may actually have \nbenefits for students. Additionally, the creation of these new, secure appointments would allow \ninstructors to dedicate more time to students and become more deeply invested in the university. \nStudies suggest that where shortcomings have been identified with contract instructors, they tend to be \nattributable to structural factors (lack of office space, insufficient time to prepare for courses, rushed \nevaluative measures) rather than instructor inability.  Taken together, the creation of teaching-tenure \npositions is likely to have a positive impact on student engagement and student learning outcomes.  \nWhile the mechanics of a teaching-tenure system remain unclear, and obtaining broad institutional buy-\nin will be critical to any initiative, the issue warrants further deliberation and study. The University of \nAlberta must demonstrate leadership on this issue to help ensure that the stock of teaching-focused \nfaculty remains stable and that students are able to continue to access high-quality education. \n2 \nThe Students' Union VPA proposes that CLE establishes a sub-committee to operate from March - \nOctober 2016 that will explore the opportunities and challenges of establishing a teaching tenure stream \nat the University of Alberta. \n2. Committee Mandate \nThe mandate of the CLE Subcommittee is to explore the opportunities and challenges for creating a \nteaching tenure stream at University of Alberta with the goal to enhance quality instruction and learning \nenvironment for undergraduate students. To fulfill this mandate the committee will consider \nundertaking the following activities: \ni. Consider the ways creation of teaching tenure stream (potentially accompanied by \ncontinuing appointments and job stability, greater professional development opportunities, \nincreased scholarship of teaching and learning, increased support and resources from home \ndepartment and faculty) will potentially affect the learning environment and quality of \ninstruction available to undergraduate students at University of Alberta. \nii. Review teaching tenure stream practices and arrangements at other Canadian peer \ninstitutions and research available literature on the issue in Canadian post-secondary \nlandscape (and if need be, at equivalent American public post-secondary context). \niii. Collect comprehensive statistics on total number of undergraduate courses and sections \ntaught by instructors who are not appointed as tenure track /tenured/ full time academic \nstaff/non-industry experts, by department / programs and faculties at University of Alberta. \niv. Consult key stakeholders on consequences of creating teaching tenure stream at University \nof Alberta on teaching and learning environment for undergraduate students and the \nopportunities and barriers to establishing a teaching tenure stream at University of Alberta. \nThis can include but is not limited to members of Dean’s Council, Chair’s Council or \nUndergraduate Chair’s Council, Students’ Union, GSA, Academic Staff Association of \nUniversity of Alberta (including representatives of Contract Academic Staff Association and \nSessional and Other Temporary Staff, members of AASUA Teaching and Learning \nCommittee) and former members (co-chairs) of Renaissance Committee. \nv. Survey and solicit aggregated feedback from members of university community on their \nviews on teaching tenure stream, with a caveat that it is only in exploratory stages.   \n3. Committee Composition \n• One representative of the Graduate Students’ Association \n• One representative of the Students’ Union \n• One representative of the Provost’s office \n• One representative of Department Chairs \n• One representative of Academic Staff \n• One representative of the Association of Academic Staff University of Alberta (external to \nCLE) \n3 \n• The Director (or delegate) of the Centre for Teaching and Learning  \n4. Committee Meetings and Timeline \n• The subcommittee will meet bi-weekly between March 2016 and October 2016. \n• A draft report for discussion will be presented at the October 2016 CLE meeting. \n5. Committee Support \nThe Office of Vice-President (Academic), Students’ Union; Office of Vice-Provost (Learning Initiatives) \nwill provide administrative support. \n6.

GFC policy 111 Teaching and Learning and Teaching Evaluation \n“111.2 Teaching Evaluation  \n1. Evaluation of teaching at the University of Alberta serves two \npurposes: \na. Summative – Evaluation provides a review and overview of an \ninstructor’s teaching that is an essential element in promotion and \ntenure decisions. In its summative form, teaching evaluation forms a \nbasis for rewarding excellence, as well as the basis for withholding \nreward. \nb. Formative – Evaluation provides helpful feedback to teachers by \nidentifying teaching strengths and weaknesses and, in so doing, giving \nguidance for the improvement or refinement of teaching skills. \n2. Evaluation of teaching must be multifaceted. Multifaceted evaluation \nshall include the Universal Student Ratings of Instruction set out in \nSection 111.3 and other methods of assessing teaching designed within \nindividual Faculties to respond to the particular conditions of that \nFaculty. Such assessments shall include one or more of the following: \ninput from administrators, peers, self, undergraduate and graduate \nstudents, and alumni. \n3. Recognizing that the evaluation of teaching at the University shall be \nmultifaceted, Faculty Evaluation Committee (FEC) decisions concerning \ntenure, promotion or unsatisfactory teaching performance must be \nbased on more than one indicator of the adequacy of teaching. \n4. Assessment of teaching involving input from administrators, peers, \nself, alumni, or undergraduate and graduate students in addition to the \nUniversal Student Ratings of Instruction should occur annually prior to \ntenure. For continuing faculty (ie, Categories A1.1, A1.5 and A1.6), such \nassessment will occur at least triennially.  \n5. The University shall continue to support University Teaching Services \nin its education programming which is focused on the development and \nimprovement of teaching and learning and its efforts to enhance \nresearch in university teaching. \n111.3 Universal Student Ratings of Instruction \nIn recognition of the University's commitment to teaching, the General \nFaculties Council endorses a system of Universal Student Ratings of \nInstruction. This system, however, is only one part of the multi-faceted \napproach described in Section 111.2. \nThe Universal Student Ratings of Instruction are administered \nelectronically via a system known as the eUSRI system.   \nThe Universal Student Ratings of Instruction are designed to provide a \nminimal university-wide base of information on student ratings to the \nparties listed in this Section. With this purpose in mind, the General \nFaculties Council adopts the following policies: \nItem No. 5 \nGFC COMMITTEE ON THE LEARNING ENVIRONMENT \nFor the Meeting of November 2, 2016 \nA. All Faculties will ensure that evaluation of all instructors and courses \nwill take place each time a course is offered. The term ‘instructors’ is \nmeant to include tenured professors, tenure-track professors, sessional \ninstructors, clinical instructors, field supervisors and graduate teaching \nassistants with responsibilities for courses. \n[…] \nD. The anonymity of student responses to the Universal Student \nRatings of Instruction is of fundamental importance in maintaining \nstudent confidentiality and encouraging the free expression of views. \nUnder normal circumstances, the anonymity of students will be \nprotected. Universal Student Ratings of Instruction offer an avenue of \nfeedback, including feedback critical of instructors. \n[…] \nG. The numerical summaries for the ten Universal Student Ratings of \nInstruction questions will be reported to the instructor, the Chair, \nDirector or Dean and students. \n[…] \nI. All results given out to students, Chairs, Directors and Deans will have \nthe following cautionary preface: \nStudent questionnaires form an important part of evaluating teaching \neffectiveness but cannot be taken alone as a complete assessment of \nan instructor or course. Factors other than an instructor’s teaching \nability may influence ratings. These factors include class size, class \nlevel, Faculty, time in class, required versus optional course, grade \nexpectations, student GPA, gender, race, ethnicity, age of both students \nand instructors. \n[…] \nJ. Nothing in this section will prevent instructors from seeking other \nmeans of feedback from students during the term.” \nThe full GFC Policy 111 Teaching and Learning and Teaching \nEvaluation is available \nat: http://www.gfcpolicymanual.ualberta.ca/111TeachingandLearningan\ndTeach.aspx \n5. University of Alberta Faculty Agreement July 2006 (incorporating \nJune 2007 and July 2008 amendments) \n“13.06 The standards for evaluation of teaching performance shall be \nbroadly based, including course content, course design and \nperformance in the classroom. Such evaluation may take into account \ninformation such as statistical summaries of responses to student \nquestionnaires, comprehensive reviews of student commentary; reviews \nby peers, reviews by administrative officials and reviews of teaching \ndossiers and other materials provided by the staff member.” \nAttachments  \n1.

However, it is likely that administrators use additional \nsources of data to inform decision-making regarding teaching staff.  It will be helpful to \nuncover how department chairs utilize USRIs to make personnel decisions and determine \nwhich other tools they use to evaluate the quality of teaching in their respective \ndepartments. Few studies have been conducted determining what actually affects decision \nmaking on an administrative level. The few studies conducted on this topic have found that \nthere are similar tool chests used in different institutions and departments, however the \nimportance of each tool to the evaluation process can vary greatly.  Collecting this \ninformation will help establish the current state of teaching evaluation at the University of \nAlberta and how to move forward with the possible implementation of multi-faceted \nevaluations. The diversity of this topic lends to interviews over survey methods to provide a \ngreater depth of response from participants.  \nSo, from this, the following are draft questions for future interviews with Chairs: \n1. Demographics\na. Identify department/faculty\nb. Number faculty/FSOs\nc. Number of sessionals\nd. Number of grad students\n2. How do you evaluate teaching?\na. Do you (or your FEC) use USRIs to evaluate the teaching of your faculty\nmembers?\nb. If yes, which of the following standard USRI statements are considered in your\nFaculty's teaching evaluation process? Which influence teaching evaluations\nmost heavily for you / for FEC?\ni. The goals and objectives of the course were clear.\nii. In-class time was used effectively.\niii. I am motivated to learn more about these subject areas.\niv. I increased my knowledge of the subject areas in this course.\nv. Overall the quality of the course content was excellent.\nvi. The instructor spoke clearly.\nvii. The instructor was well prepared.\nviii. The instructor treated the students with respect.\nix. The instructor provided constructive feedback throughout this\ncourse. \nx. Overall, this instructor was excellent.\nc. Are USRI scores viewed in context?\ni. Examples:  first-time an instructor is teaching a course; course\nassignment not in the primary area of interest / expertise of the\ninstructor; instructor tries new educational strategies; class size\n(large vs. small); differences between different types of staff.\nSessional vs. Tenured, type of delivery (online, blended, or face to\nface), etc.\nGFC Committee on the Learning Environment\nFor the Meeting of November 2, 2016\nAttachment 1 - Item 5\n 2 \n3. How do you compare your experience with e-USRIs and in-class paper-based USRIs? \na.  How does your FEC treat low response rates on any USRI? \n4.   Do you use any additional tools, other than USRIs, to evaluate teaching? \n5. How important is the evaluation of teaching in comparison to the evaluation of \nresearch and service? \na. How is evaluation of teaching different (or not) for annual review, or for \npromotion?  \n6. How do you define teaching excellence? \na.  What do you look for in excellent teaching? \nb.  What would you consider as satisfactory teaching? \nc.  Do you feel confident in your ability to evaluate teaching? Why / why not? \n7. What information do you need to evaluate teaching? \na.  Why are those important to you? \nb.  Are you able to get this information? If not, what obstacles do you face? \nc.  What supports do you need? \n8.

Could any of the following statements be useful or influence your Faculty's teaching \nevaluation process? Which ones could be most important in your teaching evaluations, how \nwould you weigh them? \n• Knowledge in the course was clearly organized \n 3 \n• Instruction requires the student to be highly active in the learning process \n• Assessments in the course are rich and varied \n• Students feel a sense of safety \n• Students feel a sense of connection to the learning task \n• Students feel a sense of connection to their classmates \n• Students go about learning in a wide variety of ways \n• Learning experiences push students a bit beyond their independent level \n• Students feel an interest or passion for what they are attempting to learn \n• Instructors show an interest or passion for what their students are \nattempting to learn \n• Instructors care deeply for their students growth and learning \n(i.e. understand the challenges they face and care for their well-being). \n• Instructors recognize complexity \n(i.e. have sufficient knowledge of content, pedagogy, context, and of students \nand the intricacies of how all of these should interact). \n• Instructors communicate clearly \n(i.e. clearly articulate expectations, encouragement, caring, and content \nknowledge). \n• Instructors serve conscientiously \n(i.e. are willing to dedicate time and energy to the profession, to work hard \nand smart, to continuously observe, reflect upon and and improve their \nperformance). \n- 1 - \nEdmonton, Alberta, October 10, 2016 \nGFC Committee on the Learning Environment \nUniversity of Alberta \nSarah Forgie, Vice-Provost (Learning Initiatives) \nDear members of the Committee: \nIn response to the GFC mandate for the Committee on the Learning Environment to \nrevise “the use of student rating mechanisms of instruction in university course” I would like to \nshare with you a set of ideas that I have developed based on what I’ve learnt so far throughout \nboth my programs, M.Ed. Technology in Education and PhD Psychological Studies in \nEducation, research experiences, and my experiences as a student and instructor. \nLearning happens all the time, it is a fundamental part of our human nature. The mere \ninteraction with our environments and the nature of our cognitive, affective and social \ncapabilities afford or enable this type of functioning. This behaviour or function is part of our \nnatural and constant adaptation to and transformation of the environments we inhabit (both social \nand natural). Not only do we naturally observe and learn to differentiate a wide range of diverse \ncharacteristics in our environments but we are also naturally formed by the communities in \nwhich live in through the natural process of socialization, which starts with our use of language. \nThe educational situations that we create and experience everyday in our diverse University \nsettings are purposefully organized learning experiences, that are based on certain knowledges \nand practises that have been used and developed and passed on both as an art and a science. \nIn the Handbook of Educational Psychology (5th ed.), teaching is explained as “someone \nteaching something to someone in some context” (Alexander, Murphy, and Greene, 2012, p. 17; \nSchwab, 1978). According to the OECD (2013), the purpose of teaching is to promote positive \nstudent learning, and teachers are those persons whose professional activity is the transmission of \nknowledge and skills to students enrolled in an educational program. The University of Alberta \nmust probably have its own formal definition of teaching and instruction. This we need to take \ninto account as part of our guiding principles. \nGFC Committee on the Learning Environment\nFor the Meeting of November 2, 2016\nAttachment 2 - Item 5\n- 2 - \nEffective Teaching in the context of OECD’s Teaching and Learning International \nSurveys, are those factors in the teaching an learning environment that contribute to meet a given \nlearning activity’s stated objectives (OECD, 2007). This OECD’s framework assumes that the \nquality of teaching is directly related to student success, that student achievement is directly \nrelated to teacher effectiveness (OECD, 2013). Carol Ann Tomlinson (2015) summarized years \nof educational research into how people best learn, the great deal of knowledge we have about \nhow people learn (2015, p. 8). In terms of the learner, she writes, “we know that each learner \nmust make meaning of what teachers seek to teach; that the meaning-making process is \ninfluenced by the student’s prior understandings, interests, beliefs, how the student learns best, \nand the student’s attitudes about self and school (National Research Council, 1990).” (2015, p.8). \nTomlinson (2015, pp. 8-9) also summarized what can be understood as seven essential elements \nof an effective instruction and which could be the basis for an improved evaluation of the \nlearning environment. Tomlinson proposed that “learning takes place most effectively in \nclassrooms” where: 1. knowledge is clearly and powerfully organized; 2. Students are highly \nactive in the learning process; 3. Assessments are rich and varied; 4. Students feel a sense of \nsafety and connection (National Research Council, 1990; Wiggins & McTighe, 1998); 5. When \nthe learning experience pushes the learner a bit beyond his or her independence level (Howard, \n1994; Vygotsky, 1962); 6. When students feel a kinship with, interest in, or passion for what they \nare attempting to learn (Piaget, 1978); and 7. When students go about learning in a wide variety \nof ways (Delpit, 1995; Gardner, 1983; Heath, 1983; Sternberg, 1985; Sullivan, 1993). \nA second author, James H. Stronge (2007), also explored the research that defines the \nelements of effectiveness in teaching and identified “which practices are most important and \nwhich require further investigation” (2007, p. Xi). Stronge summarizes the characteristics of an \neffective teacher under four overarching statements or characteristics (2007, pp. 100-102): 1. The \neffective teacher cares deeply (also see Noddings, 1992); 2. The effective teacher recognizes \ncomplexity; 3. The effective teacher communicates clearly; and 4. The effective teacher serves \nconscientiously. To care, explains Stronge, is to understand the challenges facing their students \nby inquiring as to their well-being. To recognize complexity is to have sufficient knowledge of \ncontent, pedagogy, of context, and of students that is taken into account when a teacher interacts \n- 3 - \nwith students, manages the environment, and prepares and differentiates for student learning \nneeds. Communicating clearly entails clear articulation of expectations, encouragement, and \ncaring, as well as content knowledge. Serving conscientiously is the teacher’s willingness to \ndedicate time and energy to the profession, to work hard and smart. Also, the conscientious \nteacher is concerned with his or her learning process and reflects on all the elements of \nperformance in an effort to continuously improve.   \nIn contrast, if we extrapolate the current set of mandated questions in our USRI’s, we can \ninfer that for the University of Alberta (1993), effective instruction and/ or that learning takes \nplace most effectively in classrooms were: 1. Goals and objectives are clear; 2. In-class time is \nused effectively; 3. The student feels motivated to learn more about the subject areas; 4. The \nstudent feels to have increased the knowledge of the subject areas in the course; 5. The student \nfeels the quality of the course was excellent; 6. The instructor speaks clearly; 7. The instructor is \nwell prepared; 8. The instructor treats the students with respect; 9. The instructor provides \nconstructive feedback throughout the course; and 10. The instructor is excellent. \nThe first step in the process of the evaluation of effective teaching is to clearly define the \npurpose of Education. Both the pedagogy and the curriculum are subject to the vision, to the \nideal type of person that should come out of the educational process. These characteristics or \noutcomes become the reference against to which evaluate educational activities, the quality of \ninstruction, and the amount of knowledge or skills developed. When defining the purpose of \neducation, there are always a set of common values or goals expected to be taken into account \nduring the educational process. Every University or educational institution has its own \ndistinguishable values that respond to their specific sociocultural environment. These expected \nsets of values are applicable to all kinds of learning experiences regardless of subject matter. \nWhen we are trying to maximize the learner experience is not only to make every student feel \ngood about themselves but to do so while acquiring these sets of values that we as a University \npropose, should make them a better person. \nThe educational process, it’s effectiveness and overall quality is not only a question of \nhow things were taught or what amount of information was taught. The educational process can \n- 4 - \nbe better understood by answering all of the following questions: who, what, when, where, how, \nand most importantly why. “Who” entails both the student and the teacher, “who” as in what \npersons come into the educational situation, with what characteristics, strengths and weaknesses, \nand also which interests and motivations. “What” is the curriculum, what is to be learnt in terms \nof knowledge to be acquired and skills to be developed. “Where” is an important aspect: is it a \nclassroom, an auditorium, or an on-line virtual environment? “When” entails both synchronous \nand asynchronous educational experiences, tightly constrained periods dedicated to learning or \nopen-ended learning experiences. The “why” is the most important element, the ultimate reason \nfor preparing, organizing and making the educational situation happen. The why can range from \na pure interest in passing on a set amount of knowledge which can be measured in terms of \nstandardized examinations, to facilitating the formation of a better person. The “how” is the \nresponsibility both of the student and the instructor or teacher; it is the result of an understanding \nof all the previous elements. The how is an overt or implicit response to all the previous \nquestions. \nEvery teacher or instructor needs to consistently reflect on and revise its practises, \ndesigns and delivery. Being a good teacher or instructor entails a continual process of growth. \nThis process is essential for all and not only for the “bad” ones. This evaluation process is also \npart of the learning process. The questions or topics that we ask our students to evaluate us in as \ninstructors implicitly define and teach what is important in the educational process, what is \neffective teaching, and also imply that other factors are not important in this process. Whichever \ncommon values we are trying to instill in our students and instructors we need to include in the \nevaluation process. Finally, the learning experience is by nature a conversation and a \nrelationship between an instructor and the class. The most important type of evaluation is that \nwhich helps strengthen, enhance this conversation. \nLuis Fernando Marin \nGFC-CLE Graduate Student Representative \n\tItem-1-Agenda-CLE-NO-02\n\tItem-4-White-Paper-sub-committee-teaching-stream\n\tCLE sub-committee\n\tWhite Paper\n\tsub-committee terms of Reference\n\tItem-5-USRIs\n\t5-OI-USRI\n\tItem-5-Att-1-How Do Administrators evaluate teaching questions\n\tItem-5-Att-2-Correspondence-from-CLE-member\n",
