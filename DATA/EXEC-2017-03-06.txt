Discussion: Dr Rodgers and Dr Costopoulos provided members with a summary of the SWS Working Group, which had been tasked with undertaking a comprehensive review of the current landscape of scholarly writing support at the institution and to make recommendations towards enhancement, optimization and coordination all parts of writing support. They noted that there is a general lack of awareness of the broad scope of writing support at the academy currently in place and it is important to coordinate what exists and make it more visible. A digital hub linking students to writing supports has been planned to help connect these services to those who may require it and to make these services more visible to the community. The recommendations include a reinvigoration of the University Writing Committee and that SWS be coordinated centrally by the Office of the Provost and Vice-President (Academic) to ensure that all institutional supports adhere to established principles. Following this summary, members emphasized the importance of the University Writing Committee and the role of the Chair of that body. There was support for ensuring that an academic staff member provide oversight to SWS as it supports the academic mission of the University. On the issue of the Centre for Writers, it was noted that the Report is silent on its fate as it is an operational decision.",

GFC Ad Hoc Committee Update and Discussion of GFC Executive Committee Terms of Reference  \nMaterials before members are contained in the official meeting file. \nPresenter(s): Mark Loewen; Deborah Burshtyn \nPurpose of the Proposal:  Members of the GFC Ad Hoc Committee are touring GFC Standing Committees to \nsolicit input, perspectives, and innovative ideas on moving academic governance into the future. Ideas and \ndiscussions will contribute to further discussions and consultation and inform the final report and \nrecommendations which come forward to GFC in April 2017. \nDiscussion:  \nMembers engaged in a lengthy discussion of the urgent and routine clauses in the Terms of Reference.  A \nmember suggested adding clarity around who determines when a matter cannot be deferred as this is not clear \nin the current Terms. Members discussed how often this clause had been utilized, and it was noted that the last \ntime it was utilized was regarding the APO agreement in 2010 and that the Executive Committee determined \nthat it needed approval before the next scheduled GFC meeting. A member noted that urgent could be \ninterpreted as time sensitive and be used when a matter required immediate attention. \nRegarding approval of GFC agendas, a member questioned the exact role that the Committee plays:  does the \nCommittee build the Agenda from scratch, or just accept and/or revise the draft Agenda provided?  Is the \nprocess too tightly controlled? \nThe committee discussed whether GFC was simply “rubber stamping” proposals; a member noted that as \nproposals undergo significant review and consultation before reaching GFC. The final approval could then be \nperceived as rubber stamping or alternatively an indication that the process is working efficiently. A member \nsuggested that items be brought forward to full GFC early in development rather than only for final approval in \norder to allow for discussion and input by GFC.  Although the risk of bringing items to GFC too early was noted, \nmembers agreed that some items could be brought forward for consultation at an early stage, especially if the \nitem was framed appropriately for members. Members suggested reviewing the number of GFC meetings \nscheduled per year and where these early items could appear on the GFC Agenda.  Consultation and program \napproval deadlines as well as University Calendar deadlines would need to be considered. \nA member emphasized that while removing some delegated authority from its Standing Committees might result \nin increased workload for GFC, members would welcome the opportunity to be a part of large, strategic items. \nMembers engaged in discussion in relation to specific items in the Terms of Reference including course \nchallenges, course naming, course numbering, the approval of course designators, consolidated exams, and \ninstitutional grading and marking policies and procedures and whether the GFC Executive Committee was the \nbest committee to deal with these items. \nThe Committee also discussed the structure of the GFC Executive Committee prior to 1966, the Committee’s \nrole in relation to Faculty Councils, clarification about the election process for members elected from GFC to \nserve on the GFC Executive Committee, the use of consent agendas, the Chair’s voting privileges, and whether \nthe GFC Executive Committee had ever forwarded an item to GFC without its endorsement. \nGFC Executive Committee 02/13/2017 \nPage 3 \n5. Question Period  \nA member raised a question about a change to the submission deadline of grades; the Vice-Provost and \nUniversity Registrar indicated that she would respond directly to the member. \nINFORMATION REPORTS \n6.

The review \ninvolved face-to-face meetings, a series of town halls and invitations for \nonline and email submissions from all sectors and members of the \nacademy.  The data and information gathered was reviewed by the SWS \nWorking Group and then collated into a report and recommendations to \nthe Provost.  \nFrom August to December, 2016, Drs. Rodgers and Costopoulos \nparticipated in over 25 meetings, including six town halls. The meetings \nincluded all known existing writing support units from Faculties, centres, \nand other academic units. Over 80 online submissions and 6 email \ncontributions were received and reviewed.   Regular updates on the \nprogress of the review were provided to Deans’ Council, Vice Provosts’ \nCouncil, PEC-O, Chairs’ Council and General Faculties Council. \nThe SWS Working Group achieved its overarching goal of submitting a \nreport on the current state of scholarly writing support at the UofA, and a \nseries of recommendations for the enhancement, optimization and \ncoordination of all components and dimensions of writing support \nincluding service (tutoring), teaching and research.  \nTimeline/Implementation Date The Working Group’s recommendations will be considered by the \nProvost and Vice-President (Academic), and implementation will be \nguided by that office as well.  \nSupplementary Notes and \ncontext \nAt the May 30, 2016 meeting of GFC, the Provost reported that the \nUniversity was committed to providing no-cost writing services to \nstudents and that an examination of the model including consultation \nwould occur. This issue arose on the floor of  GFC in response to a \nquestion from a member regarding the transition of services offered by \nthe Centre for Writers in the Faculty of Arts to the portfolio of the Vice-\nProvost and Dean of Students. \nEngagement and Routing (Include meeting dates) \nItem No. 5 \nGFC EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE \nFor the Meeting of March 6, 2017 \n Participation: \n(parties who have seen the \nproposal and in what capacity) \n<For further information see \nthe link posted on \nthe Governance Toolkit section \nStudent Participation Protocol> \nThose who have been informed: \n• VPC (regular updates), PEC-O (regular updates), PACD June 16, \n2016, Deans’ Council (regular updates) \n• GFC Executive Committee March 6, 2017 \n• GFC March 20, 2017 \nThose who have been consulted: \n• See Appendix 1 (SWS Workplan 2016-17) of final report \nThose who are actively participating: \nSWS Working Group Membership:  \n(SWS Working Group Terms of Reference-Attachment) \n• Deputy Provost (Co-Chair) (Wendy Rodgers) \n• Vice-Provost and Dean of Students (Co-Chair) (André \nCostopoulos) \n• One Dean, as selected by the Provost (John Nychka, Associate \nDean FGSR)  \n• One Undergraduate Student Representative (Marina Banister, \nVice-President Academic, SU) \n• One Graduate Student Representative (Ali Talaei, Vice-\nPresident Student Services, GSA) \n• One CAST Member (Roy Jensen, Sessional Lecturer, \nDepartment of Chemistry) \n• Two Faculty Members (Karsten Mundel, Associate Dean, \nAcademic, Augustana Faculty; Janice Causgrove Dunn, \nAssociate Dean, Undergraduate, Physical Education and \nRecreation) \n• See attached Online Responses (Attachment 2) \nAlignment/Compliance \nAlignment with Guiding \nDocuments \nFor the Public Good:  \nEngage communities across our campuses, city and region, province, \nnation and the world to create reciprocal, mutually beneficial learning \nexperiences, research projects, partnerships, and collaborations. \nSustain our people, our work, and the environment by attracting and \nstewarding resources we need to deliver excellence to the benefit of all \nAlbertans. \nCompliance with Legislation, \nPolicy and/or Procedure \nRelevant to the Proposal \n(please quote legislation and \ninclude identifying section \nnumbers) \n1.

PREAMBLE  \nThe University of Alberta (U of A) recognizes that academic writing is fundamental to academic \nsuccess, career success, and citizenship. The U of A community needs well coordinated writing \nsupports that are accessible, learner centred, relevant, discipline-based, responsive to diverse \nlearner needs, collaborative. These supports will ensure that our community is future ready and \nhas long term success. These supports should work together and should work in a manner \nrespectful of diverse scholarly approaches. \n1.Scholarly Writing Supports Review Process  \nFollowing a GFC discussion in May 2016, a decision was made to engage in a review of \nScholarly Writing Supports across the U of A. The review was led by Dr. Wendy Rodgers, \nDeputy Provost, and Dr. Andre Costopoulos, Vice Provost and Dean of Students. The review \nconsisted of face to face meetings and town halls and invitations for online and email \nsubmissions. The data was then reviewed by a small working group and collated into an initial \nreport.  \nFrom August to December 2016, Drs. Rodgers and Costopoulos participated in over 25 \nmeetings, including two town halls. The meetings included all known existing writing support \nunits from Faculties, centres, and other academic units listed in Appendix 1 (SWS Working \nGroup Workplan - 2016-17. Over 80 online submissions and 6 email contributions were \nreceived and carefully reviewed. Regular updates on the progress of the review were provided \nto Deans’ Council, Vice Provosts’ Council, Chairs’ Council, and General Faculties Council. \n2. Objectives \nThe overarching goals of the process are to report to the Provost and Vice-President \n(Academic) on the current landscape of scholarly writing support at the U of A and to make \nrecommendations for the enhancement, optimization and coordination of all components and \ndimensions of writing support including service (tutoring), teaching and research.  \nIt is key that a full spectrum of Scholarly Writing Supports be available to the University \ncommunity. The process is not intended to eliminate any writing supports or to reduce overall \ncentral funding associated with writing initiatives across the University; there is no intention to \nreduce the academic strength or underpinnings of any writing supports; there is no intention to \nmake support units compete with each other for funding or for clientele; there is no intention to \nmandate staffing requirements, delivery modalities, or other characteristics of supports provided \nby specific units; and there is no intention to impose a full fee or cost recovery model for all \nsupports. There is also no intention to preserve only rudimentary or corrective writing and \nediting services.  \n3. SWS Working Group and Initial Report \nThe SWS Working Group was composed in December 2016 with representatives from the \nStudents’ Union, the Graduate Students’ Association, the Faculty of Graduate Studies and \nResearch, a Contract Academic Staff: Teaching (CAST) instructor, and Associate Deans \n(Academic) from two Faculties. This group was not intended to be representative of \n2 \nconstituency groups; rather, each member was chosen for their arm's-length perspectives, and \nknowledge on relevant issues across the University.  \nAll notes, observations, and submissions from the online consultation process were reviewed by \nthe SWS Working Group. The working group, upon thorough consideration of all this information \nand feedback, developed a set of principles on which to base their recommendations, which are \nreported here. \n4. Preliminary Findings and Actions \nOne of the key findings of the consultation process was a general lack of awareness of the full \nrange, number, and quality of different kinds of writing supports across the University. Toward \nthat end, an early decision was made to re-develop a digital hub that will connect users to \nappropriate writing supports. This work has already begun.  \nA second key finding was a lack of awareness that all scholarly writing supports currently \navailable at the U of A are staffed by fully qualified and fully trained instructors and tutors, many \nwith very high level credentials and specialized professional accreditations.  \nSome of the other key messages the consultation feedback made clear included a need for a \nbroader range of services and supports, the importance of maintaining a strong academic focus, \na need to strengthen and broaden opportunities for scholarship and for training at all levels of \nparticipation (from students to professors). Finally the need for some centralized oversight and \ncoordination was voiced by a large majority of those consulted. \nB. DEFINITION OF SWS \nWriting at the University must consider issues of teaching, service delivery, support provision, \nresearch, as well as the scholarly aspects of the teaching, learning, researching, and the \ntraining of instructors. Not all supports need to address all of these considerations; however, the \nsystem of supports across the University as a whole should address all these considerations.  \nThe SWS Working Group defines scholarly writing supports as: \n● Formal centres serving the University with financial support of a Dean, Vice Provost, \nChair, and/or the Provost \n● A spectrum of initiatives run out of Faculties with the financial support of a Dean or Chair \n(non-credit offerings, boot camps, writing clinics etc.) \n● Academic offerings in the form of courses which are under the authority of Faculty \nCouncils with oversight from the General Faculties Council (GFC) \nSWS at the University of Alberta serve different audiences including students and faculty. The \nadministrative authority is also diverse and may include the Provost, Deans, Faculty Councils, \nor GFC.  \nA comprehensive list of SWS can be found on the writiing.ualberta.ca site (currently under \nconstruction).  \nhttp://writing.ualberta.ca/\n3 \nREPORT FROM THE SWS WORKING GROUP \nIn developing recommendations to achieve the needs described above, the Scholarly Writing \nSupports Working Group used several foundational principles to describe the qualities of writing \nsupport: \n1.Principle: Accessible  \nWriting supports should:  \n● Be affordable to users \n● Be offered in multiple locations  \n● Include robust online supports or options \n● Utilize multiple modalities \n● Have high visibility (high community awareness) \n● Provide choice of multiple learning environments \n● Provide choice of multiple delivery methods \n2. Principle: Learner-centered \nWriting supports should focus on learning as a key outcome (as appropriate). Being learner-\ncentred comprises:  \n● Active involvement of learners and educators in the development and delivery of \nsupports \n● Provision of a range of supports suitable to diverse learner stages and goals \n● Appropriate preparation of instructors of all kinds \n● Establishing pathways to instructor or tutor status for those who are interested \n3. Principle: Relevant \nWriting supports should be relevant to learners and to program learning outcomes. Writing \nsupports should relate to current pedagogies and reflect best practices in teaching and \nresearch, or in service provision, where appropriate. Relevance of writing supports comprises \nthe following ideas: \n● Should align with each other and with current pedagogy, best practices, and research \nevidence, as well as Faculty or unit goals and learner needs \n● Should be current and innovative  \n● Should develop transferable skills that will contribute to success in academia, careers, \nand society, and ensure learners are “future ready”  \n● Should include high quality of training for instructors/tutors/professional staff \n● Should use evidenced-based evaluation of quality \n4. Principle: Discipline Based  \nWriting supports need to relate to pedagogical goals and pathways of specific disciplines. The \nspectrum of supports across the University should include a range of activities or opportunities \nto support different kinds of writing such as technical reports, laboratory reports, literary pieces, \ncritical reviews, essays, thesis writing, etc. Disciplinary attributes include: \n● Context specificity \n● Audience appropriateness  \n● Credibility of instruction  \n4 \n● Integration of instruction or collaboration with disciplinary activities  \n5. Principle: Responsive to Diverse Learner Needs  \nWriting supports are sought out by individual learners and groups of learners under different \ncircumstances. The range of supports available should (differentially) respond to circumstances \nsuch as urgency, specificity, breadth and depth of need. There should be mechanisms for \nreviews of services to assess learner responsiveness. Being responsive should take into \nconsideration:  \n● Timeliness \n● Purpose of the writing  \n● Topic of the writing \n● Environment and method of delivery:  \n○ Delivery environments might include: credit/non-credit courses (stand-alone or \nintegrated into the curriculum); workshops; drop-in sessions; fee-for-service \nediting; bootcamps; etc. \n○ Delivery methods might include: one-on-one tutoring or coaching from peers or \nprofessionals; large group classes; seminar-type sessions; delayed editing and \nfeedback; real-time editing and feedback; on-line tutorials; study-hall sessions; \netc. \n6. Principle: Collaborative \nWriting supports across the University need to be collaborative. Support providers and \nassociated staff, including professors, tutors, and professional coaches, must work together to \nensure a spectrum of coordinated supports are available, and to support ongoing strength of an \nentire system. Collaboration should include the following: \n● Coordination of relevant disciplinary knowledge  \n● Demonstrated respect for different perspectives and methods \n● Referring users to alternative supports to better meet their needs  \n● Contributing to the community of writing at the University in meaningful ways  \n7. Principle: Centrally Coordinated \nThe Office of the Provost, including the Vice-Provost and Dean of Students and the Vice-\nProvost and Dean of FGSR, have an important role to play in supports across the University. \nThey have particular insights into the needs and opportunities for the full spectrum of \nundergraduate and graduate students. Through outreach and support of Deans and Faculties in \ntheir work to provide writing supports, the Office of the Provost can help to ensure the \nparticipation of relevant disciplinary leaders in the development and delivery of writing supports \nin alignment with the principles listed above. Finally, together with the Deans of Students and \nFGSR, the Office of the Provost can contribute and coordinate funding and funding distribution \nto writing supports across the University in fair and equitable ways, and can ensure \naccountability. Central coordination should include:  \n● Creating communications systems across the University  \n● Creating a coordinating body to support ongoing consideration and application of these \nSWS principles  \n● Coordination and allocation of funding \n● Fairness and equity in allocation of funds as well as in remuneration of tutors and \ninstructors \n5 \n8. Principle: Funding & Sustainability  \nAccepting the principle that writing supports should be accessible to all, it must also be \nacknowledged that even if they are provided with no fee to the user, the provision of supports is \nnot “free”. A determination of which supports should be subsidized and offered without a fee and \nwhich should be cost-recovery needs to be made. Overall, the spectrum of writing supports \nmust be sustainable with costs recovered when appropriate and when possible, but should, in \ngeneral, not aspire to be revenue generating. In addition, supports must be sustainable, \nincluding the training of staff and tutors. Consideration of sustainability includes the following:  \n● What should be free to the user? \n● What should be cost-recovery?  \n● What do students need most/least?  \n● How should central funding be allocated?  \n● What succession plans are in place to sustain each writing support?  \n● What training processes and paths to ‘tutor’ positions are in place to ensure sustainable \naccess to these positions and a sustainable supply of tutors to writing supports? \n● How are the principles of equity and quality applied to the allocation of funding and other \nresources? \n● Generally, for cost recovery, costs should start low as possible, and should increase with \nincreased use of supports or with increased depth of service  \n● Funding should be sustainable across the system - permitting some supports to be \nconsistently free to the user and others to have associated fees \n6 \nRECOMMENDATIONS: The Scholarly Writing Supports Working Group offers the following \nrecommendations to enhance, optimize and coordinate writing supports in all of its components \nand dimensions across the institution:  \n1. A better communication strategy is needed to ensure the University community is aware of \nthe entire range of writing supports available. Therefore, the digital hub is being re-developed to \nbetter represent the writing community and to describe all Scholarly Writing Supports. \n2. The University Writing Committee (UWC) should be re-invigorated with a stronger terms \nof reference and a mandate to provide advice to the Provost on SWS. The following actions will \nequip UWC to support the Provost: \n● UWC should have a specific and formal reporting structure through to the Office of the \nProvost and be chaired by a Provost’s Representative. \n● UWC`s mandate should include the review of existing supports taking into account \nfunding levels, user statistics, user satisfaction, and other indicators aligned with the \nprinciples listed above.  \n● UWC should have the mandate to advise the Provost on standards, protocols, and \nperformance measures around scholarly writing support.  \n● UWC membership should be reviewed and guidelines established for a composition that \nwill include representation from people associated with the supports balanced with equal \nnumbers of people not specifically affiliated with supports. \n● UWC should be consultative. \n● UWC may provide advice to a Dean or any other internal stakeholder or centre  \n● UWC should work to forge relationships among stakeholders involved in writing supports \nto build a sense of community and to encourage coordination \n3. SWS should be coordinated centrally and together with the Office of the Provost monitor \nthe principles set out in this report in order to ensure scholarly writing support is accessible \n● Current services and supports should be reviewed by UWC as stated above, with a goal \nof ensuring the principles proposed here are equitably and fairly applied to all existing \nsupports. Where applicable, new supports for writing could be established according to \nthe principles set out in this report. \n● The intent is that the range of supports should be advised by UWC such that sessions \nare regularly available in all the various physical areas of the University at predictable \ntimes and places. Spaces should be available where members of the community can \nwork on their writing projects, support each other, and have access to a range of \nsupports. It is recognized that not all supports can be available at all times.  \n● Broader integration of writing supports into curricula is recommended. The Scholarly \nWriting Supports Working Group recommends expanding the mandate of Writing Across \nthe Curriculum (WAC), such that it can support faculty members to include disciplinary \nspecific writing into the curriculum, to be coordinated at the program (or unit) level. A \nrecognition system could be built by Faculties and Units (e.g., Departments) to \nencourage and recognize individual faculty members and units for including efficient and \neffective writing assignments appropriately across their courses.  \n● The Scholarly Writing Supports Working Group recommends the development of writing \ncertificates. These might be considered first at the graduate level, and might also build \nupon the WAC activities to develop discipline specific certificates that emphasize either \n7 \nwriting capabilities in particular domains (e.g., scientific writing), or writing tutoring (e.g., \nthrough a combination of courses, directed study or research experiences, and \nevaluated practical experiences). \nRECOMMENDATIONS: ADMINISTRATIVE AND OPERATIONAL STRUCTURE OF \nSCHOLARLY WRITING SUPPORTS  \nThe SWS Working Group looked specifically at the administrative and operational structure of \nscholarly writing supports and recommends that the following principles be followed: \n1. Each SWS must have an administrative “home” in an academic unit (a Faculty or other \nunit within the Vice-President (Academic) portfolio). This “home” should be determined \nby the sources of funding and/or, if applicable, through an agreement between a Dean(s) \nor other heads of Academic Units and the Provost. \n2. Each SWS must have a defined Terms of Reference and Mandate that respects the \ncontext of other SWS. The authority to approve the mandate of a SWS rests with the \nDean and/or Academic Unit Head and Provost, including plans for staffing, staff training, \ntype of supports to be provided, nature of teaching, learning, or research focus and \nnecessity to collaborate with other units (e.g., CTL, WAC, REO, RSO, etc). Advice on \nthe mandate and the type of supports to be provided should be sought from UWC who \nwill work to maintain a balance of supports across the institution and integrity of \nprinciples listed here. \n3. Each SWS should have a sustainability plan explicitly defining the associated costs of \nthe SWS to the administrative unit noting whether they have off-setting funding sources. \nAny plans for fees-for-service or cost recovery SWS should be made explicit. The \nsustainability plan should be approved by a Dean, Academic Administrator, and/or \nProvost. The Dean and/or Provost may seek advice from UWC on sustainability \nincluding proposed SWS fee structures, if applicable. \n4. Each SWS should provide an annual report on usage, costs, innovations, etc. to the \nUWC who will review the reports and provide advice to the Provost. UWC can make \nstrategic or system wide recommendations to the Provost for each SWS. \n1. 5.The Dean, Unit Administrative Head, and/or Provost holds final authority for \nadministrative decisions regarding SWS including creation, movement, or dissolution of \nSWS. While authority rests with the Provost and/or Dean to make the administrative \ndecisions, advice may be sought from a variety of stakeholders including the UWC. \n8 \nAPPENDIX 1: SWS Working Group Workplan - 2016-17 \nDate Tasks Notes \nGFC May 30, 2016 – Question Period \nAugust 2016                                                                                                                          PHASE 1 –Aug – Dec \n2016 \n10 Organizing meeting W.

Purpose, Goals, and Outcomes  \nPurpose:  \nDuring Question Period at the May 30, 2016 General Faculties Council meeting, discussion occurred with \nrespect to scholarly writing support across the institution.  In response to this discussion, the Provost \nrequested wider institutional consultation on, and assessment of, the state of scholarly writing support across \nthe Institution. It was clear from discussion at GFC that a number of groups deliver scholarly writing support \nacross University campuses; the lack of communication and coordination between these providers was also \nclear in discussion at GFC. In September and December 2016, Deputy Provost, Wendy Rodgers, and Vice-\nProvost and Dean of Students, André Costopoulos, have engaged in consultation to identify supports already \nin place at University campuses, where they are located, how they are resourced, and how and by whom they \nare managed. They have examined types of support and services provided, have met with the constituent \ngroups utilizing and providing these supports and services, and have inquired regarding any gaps in available \nactivities. \nGoal: \nThe overarching goal of the Working Group will be to report to the Provost and Vice-President (Academic) \non the landscape of scholarly writing support at the University and to make recommendations for the \nenhancement, optimization and coordination of writing support across the institution in all of its components \nand dimensions - service (tutoring), teaching, and research.  \nPlan and Outcomes:  \n The Working Group will collate, evaluate and assess information and comments gathered from the \nreview, and will consider creation of an online “hub” of scholarly writing support activities on the \nUniversity of Alberta website \n Emerging themes, trends and characteristics will be identified and the Working Group will summarize \nand make recommendations to the Provost and Vice-President (Academic) in the form of a final report in \nFebruary 2017, which would be presented at the March or April 2017 GFC meeting.  \n2. Membership \nDeputy Provost (Co-Chair) \nVice-Provost and Dean of Students (Co-Chair)  \nOne Dean, as selected by the Provost \nOne Undergraduate Student Representative  \nOne Graduate Student Representative  \nOne CAST Member \nTwo Faculty Members \nResource personnel will attend at the invitation of the Co-Chairs.  \n3. Meetings \nThe Working Group will begin meetings in January 2017.  Meeting frequency and schedule will be at the \ndirection of the Co-Chairs. The Working Group will be coordinated by the Office of the Provost and \nVice-President (Academic).  \nU:\\AD02\\Scholarly Writing Support Working Group\\WorkingGroup\\ScholarlyWritingSupport-WorkingGroup-TermsofReference-16Dec2016.docx \ncindyw\nTypewritten Text\nATTACHMENT 2\ncindyw\nTypewritten Text\nATTACHMENT 3\ncindyw\nTypewritten Text\nRoy\nText Box\nthoughts and put these on paper in a logical way with a narrative that flows well. I don’t know how to teach that, so I just sit together with my students and do it together with them, explaining what goes on in my head as I help prepare a draft manuscript or thesis chapter. Some pick it up and somehow learn to do it by themselves, others don't. SSC and C4W do offer seminars and services that are helpful in this regard, but your pay structure seems confusing and inappropriate.\nIn my mind, seminars for small or large groups on academic/thesis/manuscript/term-paper writing SHOULD BE FREE. This should be viewed as an essential service by the university to any graduate or undergraduate student to make them successful in their programs and subsequent careers. \nIn contrast, it seems to me that all individual mentoring should be COST RECOVERY (perhaps providing some income opportunities for advanced students). Specifically, I like to see mentoring where an advanced writer (can be an advanced peer) sits together with the student and interviews them during the editing: “What do you want to say with this?”, “Where would that best fit in the narrative?”, “Is this argument logical?”, …etc. and then help the student to more effectively and convincingly convey their thoughts. I don’t think that should ever be a service we offer where the trainee is actually not present. This must be mentoring not a service. \nThx for taking the time and making the effort to collect input across campus. Much appreciated. \nCheers, A.\nRoy\nText Box\nrun a successful, supportive writing support centre. During my service on the University Writing Committee, I saw the commitment dwindle, as the promised prominent space for the Centre for Writers was withdrawn. Comments have variously been made to the effect that writing help is available if students pay for the service, which is true but not appropriate. Students deserve to have writing support offered as part of their tuition. This is especially true for international students, whose financial burden is greater than for non-visa students and who should at least receive some support in return for this additional tuition.\nI write this extensive response in hopes that the University will renew its commitment to support students at all levels to develop strong, sophisticated composition skills in their diverse disciplines.  Our students deserve this support and practical recognition of the work world they will enter. Such support is one step in our goal of fashioning the University of Alberta “for the public good.”\nRoy\nText Box\nnot allow for the potential in research and writing to be reached because so many are not supported. \nRoy\nText Box\nit does not contain any ideas, so how could it be plagiarized? This leads to some gray areas which require mentoring of students through the early drafts of papers and thesis drafts. We would like to see more clarity on discipline-specific guidelines across campus, and we are making this point wherever possible.\nFor the purposes of those of us who have to make rulings on fairly large documents, it would be very helpful to have access to a campus-wide software search tool (e.g. Turnitin.com) for the purposes of teaching as well as verifying originality, at least as a first pass. The Faculty of Arts does some excellent work on plagiarism checking which is contracted out to someone skilled in this area.\nRoy\nText Box\nwho must work with her.  It was astounding and insulting when she was reappointed.\nMinute 13 - GFC May 30, 2016 - Centre for Writers - Excerpted \nThere were no documents.  \nPresenter: Steven Dew, Provost and Vice-President (Academic)  \nPurpose of the Proposal: To discuss the Centre for Writers.  \nDiscussion:  \nDr Dew reported that the plan to transition the Centre for Writers from the Faculty of Arts to the \nportfolio of the Vice-Provost and Dean of Students has been deferred to further examine the \nmodel and provide for greater consultation.  \nIn addition to comments on student participation in the consultation process, a member expressed \nconcern surrounding the sudden discontinuation of an academic unit without input from GFC. \nOn this point, Dr Dew clarified that the Centre for Writers was created as an administrative unit. \nDr Dew further indicated that writing services are provided across campus to students and that \nthe University was committed to continuing to provide no-cost service to students.  \nA member suggested inviting Dr Luci Moussu and Dr Betsy Sargent to the table to speak about \nthe impact of this decision. The Chair ruled this out of order. \nMinute 8 – GFC September 26, 2016 - Update from the Provost and Vice-President \n(Academic) - Consultation Process for Centre for Writers - Excerpted \nThere were no documents.  \nPresenter: Steven Dew \nPurpose of the Proposal: For information/discussion.  \nDiscussion:  \nDr Dew provided an update in regards to the consultation process for reviewing the state of \nscholarly writing support at the academy. He emphasized that the review will include wide \nconsultation from all members of the community. He stated that Vice-Provost and Dean of \nStudents, André Costopoulos, and Deputy Provost, Wendy Rodgers, would lead the process.

The Policy suite includes key definitions to educate all \nmembers of the university community.   Fundamental principles \nestablished in the policy suite include the importance of believing \nsurvivors when they disclose an experience of sexual violence and \nproviding support, accommodations, interim measures, and information \non filing a formal complaint.  \nIn addition, the proposed policy indicates “The University takes seriously \nits responsibility to reduce sexual violence by fostering a culture of \nconsent and support through education, training and policy.”  The impact \nwill be an increasingly educated and informed community that can better \nhandle disclosures and complaints of sexual violence. \nThe Government of Alberta has made it clear that they expect every \ninstitution to produce a stand-alone policy on sexual violence.  \nReplaces/Revises (eg, policies, \nresolutions) \nN/A \nTimeline/Implementation Date Upon final approval \nEstimated Cost and funding \nsource \nN/A \nNext Steps (ie.: \nCommunications Plan, \nImplementation plans) \nThe University’s central Marketing and Communications office will \ndevelop and execute a communications strategy to inform the campus \nand broader communities.

Overview \na.  Sexual violence is a complex and serious problem in society and on university campuses. Sexual \nviolence can affect individuals of all gender identities, gender expressions, and sexual orientations, as \nwell as those from all ages, abilities, racial, cultural and economic backgrounds. \nb. The University recognizes the harm caused by a culture in which common attitudes, norms and practices \ntolerate, normalize, trivialize, excuse or outright condone sexual violence. Sometimes called rape culture, \nit is perpetuated through images, television, music, jokes, advertising, jargon, words and figures of \nspeech that normalize sexual coercion and shift blame onto those who have experienced sexual violence. \nAs an institution that exists in the context of that culture, the University takes seriously its responsibility to \nreduce sexual violence by fostering a culture of consent and support through education, training and \npolicy. \nc. This policy is guided by the following principles: \ni. the need for safety in the work, study and student residence environment, providing a community \nin which sexual violence is not tolerated, \nii. the inherent dignity of all members of the University community, \niii. the importance of fostering a culture of consent and support through education, training and \npolicy initiatives, \niv. the need to identify and dismantle barriers to making a disclosure and/or complaint,  \nv. access to support for anyone in the University community who discloses that they have \nexperienced or been affected by sexual violence, and \nvi. procedural fairness and support for the parties to formal complaint processes related to sexual \nviolence. \n2. Purpose \nThe purpose of this policy is to state the University’s commitment to addressing sexual violence through \neducation and awareness, providing access to comprehensive support for those who have experienced or \nbeen affected by sexual violence and implementing transparent and fair processes to resolve and adjudicate \ncomplaints of sexual violence. \n  U of A Policies and Procedures On-Line (UAPPOL) \n3. POLICY \na.  It is the policy of the University of Alberta that sexual violence committed by any member of the University \ncommunity is prohibited and constitutes misconduct. Prohibited conduct includes: sexual violence, sexual \nassault, sexual harassment, stalking, indecent exposure, voyeurism, and distribution of intimate \nimages.  \nb. Any member of the University community who discloses having experienced sexual violence will have \naccess to support, whether or not the sexual violence took place on University property or in relation to \nUniversity activities. Where the University has jurisdiction, complaints will be addressed under the \napplicable policies or procedures, including, for example, the Code of Student Behaviour, the \nPostdoctoral Fellow Policy, NASA, AASUA or GSA collective agreements, or other applicable \nemployment contracts and agreements. \n4. COMMITMENT TO THOSE WHO HAVE EXPERIENCED SEXUAL VIOLENCE \na. Sexual violence can have serious and enduring negative effects on physical, mental, emotional and \nspiritual health and wellness. The University recognizes the possible effects of trauma on those who have \nexperienced sexual violence and supports the efforts of individuals to seek support and recover. \nRegardless of where or when it took place, any person who discloses and/or makes a complaint of sexual \nviolence can expect to be: \ni. treated with respect, dignity and compassion, \nii. informed about on- and off-campus resources and supports, \niii. provided with access to support which is non-judgmental, coordinated and comprehensive  \niv. offered options for academic, recreational, University residence and/or workplace modifications \nto prevent further unwanted contact with the subject of the disclosure and ameliorate, to the \nextent possible, the negative impacts of the sexual violence on the person’s working, study or \nstudent residence environment, \nv. provided with information about available complaint processes should they wish to pursue a \ncomplaint within the University and/or to an external law enforcement agency, and  \nvi. offered safety planning assistance. \nb. Subject to the limitations set out in section 6 of this policy, those who experience sexual violence will be \nconsidered the primary decision-maker in matters pertaining to themselves.

OVERVIEW \na. The University recognizes the difference between a disclosure and a complaint, and is committed to \nresponding to and reducing sexual violence and attending to its effects by providing  \n supports and resources to persons who have experienced sexual violence and to any other member of \nthe University community who has been affected by sexual violence,  \n interim measures to ensure the safety of the University’s learning, working and residence environment, \n processes to fairly adjudicate formal complaints of sexual violence, and \n education and training to the University community about sexual violence and, in particular, to those \ninvestigating and adjudicating complaints of sexual violence.  \nb. The University will consult with University of Alberta Protective Services (UAPS), Human Resource Services, \nlegal, medical, and/or psychological experts and others as appropriate in determining how to act on \ndisclosures or complaints of sexual violence. \n2. PURPOSE \nThe purpose of this procedure is to \n provide guidance to members of the University community on receiving and responding to disclosures of \nsexual violence, \n outline supports, modifications and protections the University may be able to offer to persons who have \nexperienced sexual violence,  \n provide authority for the imposition of interim measures to ensure the safety of the working, learning and \nUniversity residence environment,  \n describe the procedures through which complaints of sexual violence will be addressed and, where \nwarranted, discipline imposed, and  \n address education and training in, and awareness of, sexual violence for the University community \ngenerally and, in particular, for those investigating and adjudicating complaints of sexual violence.  \nPROCEDURE \nThe University’s response to a disclosure will, to the extent possible, be guided by the wishes of the person who \nexperienced the sexual violence. In this regard, in response to a disclosure, the person who experienced sexual \n  U of A Policies and Procedures On-Line (UAPPOL) \nviolence can ask the University to provide supports and resources, facilitate academic, residential, recreation \nand/or work modifications, consider the imposition of interim measures, and initiate an investigation of a complaint \nin accordance with the procedures in applicable agreements or policies. \n3. INTERIM MEASURES \na. Interim measures are non-disciplinary conditions that may be imposed on a person alleged to have committed \nsexual violence. The University may impose interim measures in response to either a disclosure or a \ncomplaint where the allegations would \ni. if proven, constitute sexual violence, and \nii. with regard to all of the circumstances, be a risk to an individual, the community or the integrity of any \npotential investigation. \nb. The purpose of such interim measures is to ensure personal safety, discourage or prevent retaliation, \nprevent further sexual violence, protect confidentiality, minimize disruption to the learning, working or \nUniversity Residence environment and/or preserve the University’s ability to conduct a thorough investigation. \nc. Having regard to all of the circumstances, where interim measures are imposed, they must be, appropriate \nand proportionate to the seriousness of the alleged conduct, and as minimally restrictive as possible to \nachieve their purposes. As a result, interim measures will be based on considerations including, but not \nlimited to: \ni. the reasonable wishes of the person who experienced the sexual violence,  \nii. the nature and/or severity of the alleged conduct, \niii. reasonably credible information about patterns of conduct or previous history of sexual violence or other \nmisconduct, \niv. the potential impact of the measures on the person(s), including on their academic program and/or \nemployment,  \nv. the potential impact of the measures on the learning, working or University Residence environment, \nvi. in the case of employees, in accordance with their relevant collective agreement, and \nvii. any other relevant information.  \nExamples of interim measures can be found in the University’s Sexual Violence Interim Measures Information \nDocument. \nd. The decision to impose interim measures will be made by: \ni. in the case of students, the Vice-Provost and Dean of Students, or designate. \nii. in the case of faculty and staff, the Provost and Vice-President (Academic) and/or the Associate Vice-\nPresident (Human Resources), or designate. \niii. in the case of postdoctoral fellows, the Vice-President (Research) , or designate. \nDecision makers may consult as needed in determining whether to impose interim measures and the nature \nof those measures.  \ne. In all cases, decisions on interim measures must be provided in writing and include: \ni. particulars of the measure(s), \nii. information about the right to request a reconsideration, \niii. information about relevant complaint processes, if applicable, and \niv. referrals to supports and/or services. \nf. The person(s) on whom interim measures are imposed may request a reconsideration from the decision \nmaker after sixty (60) days or such earlier time as agreed to by the decision maker. Further, at any time, on \nthe basis of new information, the decision maker may on his or her own initiative reconsider the interim \nmeasures imposed and renew, revise, or revoke any or all of the measures, or impose additional interim \nmeasures. \n  U of A Policies and Procedures On-Line (UAPPOL) \ng. Interim measures will be re-evaluated when a complaint process is concluded. \n4. PROCEDURES TO ADDRESS COMPLAINTS \na. Complaints of sexual violence will be resolved according to the procedures set out in the University’s \nagreements with the Association of Academic Staff: University of Alberta (AASUA), the Non-Academic Staff \nAssociation (NASA), the Graduate Student Assistantship Collective Agreement, the Postdoctoral Fellows \nDiscipline Procedure, the Code of Student Behaviour, the Residence Agreement, Practicum Intervention \nPolicy, and any other applicable contracts, agreements or policies. \nb. In all cases, use of the procedures at the University does not preclude a report to the appropriate law \nenforcement agency, professional governing body, or pursuing any other civil or other remedy available at \nlaw. \nStudents \nc. Complaints of sexual violence against students will be addressed using procedures outlined in one or more of \nthe following documents. When the person accused in the complaint is:  \ni. a student, the Code of Student Behaviour, \nii. a student living in a University Residence, the Breach of Residence Agreement process,  \niii. a student in a practicum placement, the Practicum Intervention Policy; \niv. a graduate student while appointed in a role as a graduate teaching assistant, graduate research \nassistant or short-term academically-related employment at the time of the offence, the Graduate Student \nAssistantship Collective Agreement. \nAs noted, students may be subject to more than one procedure and may, therefore, be subject to several \nprocedures concurrently.  \nEmployees, postdoctoral fellows and volunteers \nd. Complaints of sexual violence against employees, postdoctoral fellows and volunteers will be resolved \nthrough the following procedures. When the person accused in the complaint is:  \ni. a member of the Non Academic Staff Association (NASA), the processes outlined in the collective \nagreement between the University and NASA;  \ni.ii. or the Association of Academic Staff: University of Alberta (AASUA), the processes outlined in the \napplicable collective agreement between the University and AASUA; \nii.iii. a postdoctoral fellow, the Postdoctoral Fellows Discipline Procedure; \niii.iv. an employee under an employment contract or agreement, but not subject to the above collective \nagreements or Procedure, where no policy or procedure exists and where no procedures are specified in \nthe terms and conditions of their employment, the procedure will be determined on a case-by-case basis, \nensuring that the accused person has the right to: \n1.  an impartial decision-maker, \n2.  know the case to be met, \n3.  an opportunity to respond to the allegations in the complaint, \n4.  be accompanied by an advisor, and \n5.  a timely resolution. \nOthers \ne. When the person accused in a complaint or disclosure is not a member of the University Communityany other \nperson, the University may address the matter through means including, but not limited to, the Trespass to \nPremises Act of Alberta or the Petty Trespass Act of Alberta, reports to the appropriate law enforcement \nagency or professional governing body. \n5. COMPLAINANT RIGHTS IN COMPLAINTS PROCESS \n  U of A Policies and Procedures On-Line (UAPPOL) \na. The applicable procedures for investigating and adjudicating complaints of sexual violence are required to \nadhere to the principles of procedural fairness. Adherence to such principles is necessary to ensure that \npersons accused of sexual violence are protected by receiving a fair adjudication. At the same time, the \nprocedures for investigating and adjudicating complaints of sexual violence must also be conducted with due \nregard to their effects on the complainant. Having such regard is necessary in recognition that investigatory \nand adjudicative processes can themselves cause additional trauma to a complainant. In balancing these \nobligations, investigators and adjudicators will be mindful to conduct their functions in a way that reduces, to \nthe extent possible, the risk of additional harm to the complainant, while ensuring procedural fairness for the \nperson accused in the complaint. \nb. Without limiting the foregoing, where not already provided for in any complaints process related to sexual \nviolence at the Universitybut subject to the provisions of any applicable collective agreement, the complainant \nwill have the right to: \ni. be accompanied by a support person throughout their participation in any investigatory or disciplinary \nproceedings, \nii. be informed of, make and respond to procedural requests, \niii. make oral or written representations on their own behalf, through their support person or other \nappropriate party, regarding impact and sanction, \niv. receive a copy of the written reasons for the decision. \n6. PREVENTION, EDUCATION AND TRAINING \na. Further information about: \n receiving and managing a disclosure of sexual violence, can be found in the University’s Responding to a \nDisclosure of Sexual Assault, available at https://www.ualberta.ca/current-students/sexual-assault-\ncentre/responding \n support services and resources for persons affected by sexual violence can be found in the University’s \nOptions, Services and Resources for Those who have Experienced Sexual Violence Information \nDocument. \n the steps or measures the University can take, including modifications to academic program(s), University \nresidence, recreational or other programs, or work environment, in response to a disclosure of sexual \nviolence can be found in the University’s Options, Services and Resources for Those who have \nExperienced Sexual Violence Information Document. \nb. The University will provide education to the entire University community on sexual violence including, but not \nlimited to, policy awareness, consent and responding to disclosures.  \ni. Additional workshops will be offered for those more likely to receive disclosures. \nii. Training in bystander intervention, provided on a voluntary basis to students and staff. \nc. All persons (i) investigating complaints of sexual violence, and (ii) adjudicating complaints of sexual violence \nin the complaint resolution procedures outlined above must have appropriate training. \nd. Information on appropriate training can be found in the University’s Sexual Violence Education and Training \nInformation Document. \nDEFINITIONS \nDefinitions should be listed in the sequence they occur in the document (i.e. not alphabetical). \nAny definitions listed in the following table apply to this document only with no implied or intended \ninstitution-wide use.

Resources and Services Information Document     Page 1 \nMost Recent Editorial Date: November 15, 2016 \nOptions, Resources and Services  \nfor Those who have Experienced Sexual Violence Information Document \nIntroductory Note: \nThe University of Alberta respects each person's right to make their own decisions regarding their personal recovery after sexual violence. This \ndocument is intended to provide a non-exhaustive list of the various options available so that all students, staff, postdoctoral fellows and faculty \ncan assist in making appropriate referrals upon receiving a disclosure or make informed decisions for themselves after experiencing sexual \nviolence.  \nIndividual reactions to sexual violence will differ greatly, and a person's decision about how to respond to an experience of sexual violence may \nchange over time. Whether the result of a disclosure or a complaint, the University can assist with some of those responses, including providing \nacademic, work or University residence modifications, safety planning, personal support, making a complaint or other options that meet the goals \nof the Sexual Violence policy and related procedures.  \nSome may need a more comprehensive and coordinated response. The SVRT (Sexual Violence Response Team) is convened when an individual \ndiscloses that they have experienced sexual violence, and may need more than one modification to meet the goals of the Sexual Violence policy. \nIt is designed to provide access to multiple options, resources and responses without the individual having to approach each service separately.  \nIt should be understood that mediation is not appropriate for situations involving sexual violence. Mediation is a conflict resolution mechanism that \npresumes all parties have an equal role in resolving a conflict. Sexual violence is not a conflict, but a harm inflicted on another person. Mediation \nintroduces a significant risk of additional harm to the person to whom the violence was done and should never be considered an option in cases of \nsexual violence. \nWHAT ARE MY OPTIONS? \nPersonal Support | Medical Assistance | Safety | Modifications – Academic/Work/Living | Complaints | Other Resources and Services \nOptions, Resources and Services Information Document     Page 2 \nPersonal\tSupport\t\nOPTION HOW DO I DO THIS?

As one example, if a \nvictim did not scream or fight or say “no,” the assumption may be that there must have been implicit consent. These \nassumptions can be held by anyone receiving a disclosure, investigating, or adjudicating a complaint, or even by \nthose who have experienced sexual violence themselves. Education on these and other topics is designed to correct \nthese misconceptions. In addition, research on the potential effects of trauma on memory, recall and behaviour sheds \nnew light on methods for interviewing those who have experienced trauma. \nThe goals of education, bystander intervention and other training are to help those who experience sexual violence \nfeel safer in disclosing and/or making a complaint and seeking support; ensure that those who receive disclosures \nknow how to support and refer; allow investigators to use trauma-informed interview techniques in order to get the \nbest information possible from complainants; and ensure that decision-makers in complaint processes are able to \nappropriately interpret the evidence before them. Below is a non-exhaustive list of selected training and education \nopportunities. Any other relevant training should also be considered, as appropriate. \nFOR THE UNIVERSITY COMMUNITY \nThe resources below are available to members of the University community at no cost and provide education and \ntraining in the areas of understanding sexual assault, consent, bystander intervention, gender based violence, effects \nof trauma and trauma-informed interviewing.  \nSexual Assault Centre (no cost) \n Videos: Understanding Sexual Assault \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3j3qgLRQaIw&list=PL2V1RRG3M1rTKPuhw2eHWvVlVcrBcDKsH&index\n=1  \n Online guide: How to Respond to a Disclosure of Sexual Violence https://www.ualberta.ca/current-\nstudents/sexual-assault-centre/responding \n Working for Change workshops: Email edcoord@ualberta.ca  \nthe Landing (no cost) \nThe Gender Based Violence Prevention Program (GBVPP) is a campus and community-wide initiative designed to \nincrease awareness, education, communication, inclusion and safety.

In addition, consent cannot be given in advance of sexual \nactivity that is expected to occur at a later time. It is the responsibility of \nthe person wanting to engage in sexual activity to obtain clear consent \nfrom the other and to recognize that consent can be withdrawn at any \ntime. \nComplainant An individual who makes a complaint under a University process. \nRELATED LINKS \nShould a link fail, please contact uappol@ualberta.ca.
