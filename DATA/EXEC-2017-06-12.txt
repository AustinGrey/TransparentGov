            "Description": " Purpose of the Proposal: To review and discuss the recommendations of the ad hoc committee and the impact on the mandate and responsibilities of the GFC Executive Committee as reflected in the Terms of Reference. Discussion: University Secretary Marion Haggarty-France noted that there would be substantial turnover in membership of the GFC Executive Committee, but that it is an opportunity for renewal and a chance to bring additional individuals into the important work to be completed. GFC Secretary Ms Meg Brolley reported that the role of the ad hoc Transition Committee in overseeing the completion of the recommendations in the ad hoc Report is a crucial one. She reminded committee members of their role in this process. The Chair led members through the recommended changes to the committee Terms of Reference. During the discussion in relation to the membership composition of the GFC Executive Committee, members expressed support for a maximum of two members per Faculty. On the topic of the committee Vice-Chair, members debated the merits of placing the Provost and Vice-President (Academic) automatically into the role. Members agreed that a faculty member serving in this role sends a message that faculty members can be leaders within senior academic governance bodies and aligns with the principles approved by GFC. Members also discussed the advantages of including a Dean on the committee and how how the Dean would be selected to serve. Members discussed the removal of the urgent and routine clause from the Terms of Reference. Ms Haggarty- France reminded members that on occasion urgent matters such as the H1N1 crisis had been delegated to the President and Provost by the Board of Governors, with the stipulation that the the matter be included on the next agenda. It was agreed that this should be noted within the Terms of Reference for transparency. It was reported that the routine clause has been removed from the Terms of Reference, as it lacked meaningful definition. On the issue of certain academic procedures, such as course designators, consolidated examinations, and the academic calendar, Ms Brolley reported that some fit better within the mandate of the GFC Academic Standards Committee (ASC). Members discussed the importance of retaining authority over the academic schedule, as it impacts the entire institution. The Chair invited members to discuss course and program challenges and its place within the terms of reference for the committee. Members debated whether these should be redirected to the GFC Academic Planning Committee or the GFC Academic Standards Committee, since they relate to academic programming. Although there was unanimous agreement that these issues should not be debated at full GFC, members did suggest that in the event Faculties could not amicably resolve such issues, that the final process requires additional consideration in terms of process. A member, in addition, noted that this could become a larger issue if the budget model changes. Members discussed the process of compiling GFC agendas and it was noted that the list seems overly prescriptive in the origin of agenda items. The Chair thanked members for their discussion and reported that the Terms of Reference would be a recurring item on future agendas.",

Convocation Admission: Proposed Changes  \nMaterials before members are contained in the official meeting file. \nPresenter(s): Douglas Stollery \nPurpose of the Proposal: To discuss amending the Convocation Admission. \nDiscussion: \nThe Chancellor provided members with an overview of past and current versions of the Convocation Admission \nand noted that the script was not inclusive of all students. As a secular institution, with values of inclusivity and \nnon-discrimination, he noted that it was important to have this reflected in the admission. The Chancellor noted \nthat the current wording charges “for all who believe, to serve your God”; he provided the committee with \nproposed wording to replace this which was more inclusive, “to serve your community for the public good”, and \nallowed individuals to define their own community. This has received support from the President’s Office, Senate \nand the Convocation Committee.  \nThe Chancellor also spoke about the Convocation Invocation for the information of the committee noting that the \nauthority to change this wording lies with the Chancellor. He provided the committee with an overview of how \nthis wording had changed over the years and noted that the invocation was a strong religious opening. He \npresented revised wording that had received the same consultation process as the admission. The revised \nwording would replace the Invocation, would focus on the celebration of the event and would include the \nuniversity’s motto by starting with the words, “Whatsoever things are true…”. The Chancellor indicated that this \nnew language would be used for the upcoming spring convocation ceremonies. \nDuring the discussion, members expressed strong support for the more inclusive wording. The Chair noted that \nthis item would be placed on the next GFC agenda for early consultation; changes to the Convocation \nAdmission would return to GFC for approval in the fall. \nITEMS FROM GFC ACADEMIC PLANNING COMMITTEE FOR GFC AGENDA (for information only) \n7.
