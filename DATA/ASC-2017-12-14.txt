ASC will consult as necessary with the Faculties \nand with other individuals and offices in its consideration of these \nproposals. \nii. ASC acts for GFC in approving routine and/or editorial changes to \nboth admission/transfer policies and academic standing regulations” \n3. UAPPOL Admissions Policy: “Admission to the University of Alberta \nis based on documented academic criteria established by individual \nFaculties and approved by GFC. This criteria may be defined in areas \nsuch as subject requirements, minimum entrance averages, and \nlanguage proficiency requirements. In addition to academic requirements \nfor admission, GFC authorizes each Faculty to establish such other \nreasonable criteria for admission of applicants as the Faculty may \nconsider appropriate to its programs of study, subject to the approval of \nGFC (e.g. interview, audition, portfolio, etc.) \nThe admission requirements for any Faculty will be those approved by \nGFC as set forth in the current edition of the University Calendar. In \naddition to the admission requirements, selection criteria for quota \nprograms, where they exist, will also be published in the current edition \nof the University Calendar. \nThe responsibility for admission decisions will be vested in the Faculty \nAdmission Committees or in the Deans of the respective Faculties, as \nthe councils of such Faculties will determine.” \n4.  UAPPOL Admissions Procedure: \n“PROCEDURE \n1. EFFECTIVE DATE OF CHANGES TO ADMISSION REGULATIONS \nFollowing approval by GFC: \na. Where changes to admission regulations may disadvantage students \nItem No. 4A – 4D \nGFC ACADEMIC STANDARDS COMMITTEE \nFor the Meeting of December 14, 2017 \nin the current admission cycle, normally implementation will be effective \nafter the change has been published in the University Calendar for one \nfull year (i.e., effective the second year that the information is published \nin the University Calendar). \nFor example, a change approved in May 2005 would be first published in \nthe 2006-2007 University Calendar in March 2006. Therefore the \nstatement cannot come into effect until September 2007 (affecting \napplicants who apply for the September 2007 term beginning July \n2006).” \nb. Where changes to admission regulations are deemed by the \napproving body to be ‘advantageous to students’, normally the date of \nimplementation will be effective immediately or at the next available \nintake for the admitting Faculty.” \n5.  PSLA: The PSLA gives Faculty Councils the authority to “determine \nthe conditions under which a student must withdraw from or may \ncontinue the student’s program of studies in a faculty” (Section 29(1)(d)). \n6. UAPPOL Academic Standing Policy:  “All current academic \nstanding regulations, including academic standing categories, University \ngraduating standards and requirements for all individual programs will be \nthose prescribed by Faculty Councils and GFC as set forth in the \nUniversity Calendar.” \n7. UAPPOL Academic Standing Regulations Procedures: “All \nproposed new academic standing regulations and changes to existing \nacademic standing regulations will be submitted by the Faculties or the \nAdministration to the Provost and Vice-President (Academic). Faculties \nwill also submit to the Provost and Vice-President (Academic) any \nproposed changes to the use and/or computation of averages relating to \nacademic standing, including promotion and graduation. \nIf the Provost and Vice-President (Academic) determines the proposal to \nbe in good order, the proposal will be introduced to the appropriate \nUniversity governance process(es). In considering these proposals, \ngovernance bodies will consult as necessary with the Faculties and with \nother individuals and offices. \nNormally, changes become effective once they are approved by GFC or \nits delegate and are published in the University Calendar.” \nAttachments  \n1.

Tentative end date June 30, 2024 \nSECTION A: PROGRAM SUSPENSION \nSECTION 1:  RATIONALE \n1.1 Identify the purpose for the suspension with supporting rationale and evidence (e.g., low \nstudent demand, declining labour market demand, institutional capacity, need for program \nredevelopment, quality assurance review recommendation, etc.). \nThe rationale for suspending the combined major in French and Spanish in the Department of \nModern Languages and Cultural Studies is that the department proposes to consolidate all \ncurrently existing major programs into one single major in Modern Languages and Cultural \nStudies. The proposed new major will provide a more interdisciplinary approach to the teaching \nof languages, literatures, and cultures, allow students to engage with more than one area of the \n2 \ndepartment more effectively than they can in the current language-based and compartmentalized \nmajors, and make it easier for students to study multiple languages.  \nStudents who wish to focus on French and Spanish in the new major will be able to do so in the \nproposed MLCS major.  \nThe proposed suspension and ultimate termination of the combined major in French and Spanish \nis a necessary administrative step.  \n1.1.1 Document enrolments (by FLE and headcounts) for the most recent 5-year period, \nincluding the current academic year if available. \nCombined Major in French and Spanish \n1.1.2 Indicate when admissions into program/specialization will be or were closed. \nSubject to government approval, the proposed major in Modern Languages and Cultural Studies \nwill be available for students in Fall 2019. At that point, there will be no further admission to the \ncombined major in French and Spanish. Active students who entered the combined major in \nFrench and Spanish prior to September 2019 will be taught out and able to finish their studies in \nthe current program and receive their Bachelor of Arts. They would be asked to complete all \nprogram requirements by April 30, 2024 and the last degree with a combined major in French \nand Spanish will be granted at Spring Convocation 2024. If any active students in the initial \nstages of the combined major in French and Spanish would like to switch to the new major in \nModern Languages and Cultural Studies, they may opt to do so and follow the requirements of \nthe new major.  \n1.1.3  Explain how the proposed end date of the suspension was determined.  \nEnrolment 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 \nTotal head count 10 16 17 10 7 \n Full-Time Year 1 2 7 4 4 3 \n Full-Time Year 2 5 2 9 2 0 \n Full-Time Year 3 0 5 1 4 1 \n Full-Time Year 4 3 2 3 0 3 \nTotal FLE 1 2.8 5.4 3 1 \n FLE Year 1 0 0 0 0 0 \n FLE Year 2 0 0.5 0.9 0 0.3 \n FLE Year 3 1 1.8 1 0.7 0.3 \n FLE Year 4 0 0.5 3.5 2.3 0.4 \n3 \nThe proposed end date is dependent on the approval of the MLCS major. We hope that the \nsuspension of the current majors will be implemented by July 1, 2019 with a proposed end date \n(dependent on government approvals) of June 30, 2024. This allows students who enrolled in the \ncombined major in French and Spanish before Sept. 2019 to finish their degree. At the end date \nof the suspension, the combined major in French and Spanish will be terminated. \n1.1.4 Provide specific information about which internal governance body approved the \nsuspension, and provide date of approval. (Attach copy of minutes or motions.) \nOn May 25, 2017 Arts Faculty Council (AFC) approved the proposed MLCS major and the \nsuspensions of all current majors (item 13.1, see attached minutes).  \n1.2 Check the applicable box to specify the longer-term plan. \n☑  To terminate the program.  \n☐  To reactivate the program.  \nSECTION 2: ACCESS \n2.1 Identify potential student access considerations and risks for Campus Alberta that the \nsuspension of this program could pose (include both (a) information about related programs \navailable to prospective students internally at your institution; and (b) externally at other \nAlberta institutions). \nStudents will be able to focus on French and Spanish in the new major in Modern Languages and \nCultural Studies and take the same courses that were available to them as part of the suspended \nmajors. Therefore, it has no implications externally at other Campus Alberta institutions. \n2.1.1 If the program or specialization is unique in the province, describe consultation within \nCampus Alberta to investigate feasibility of program/specialization transfer. \nConsultation within Campus Alberta occurred as part of the development of the proposal for the \nnew major in MLCS. No consultation regarding the suspension of existing majors was necessary \ndue to the fact that courses in these languages, literatures, and cultures will still be offered within \nthe proposed MLCS major. While the language majors may no longer exist, the institution will \n4 \nretain the capacity to offer language acquisition experiences in them through the MLCS major. \nStudents’ transcripts will allow them to show their language competencies.  \n2.2 Describe the consultation process that occurred with students at your institution regarding \nthis programming change. \nStudent feedback was solicited in various ways. In February and November 2016, respectively, \nthe proposed new major in Modern Languages and Cultural Studies was presented to a total of \n882 (362 and 520) students during class visits (858 students enrolled in 29 different classes, \nselected to represent a cross-section of all of our programs) and at a special town hall meeting \nheld on February 25, 2016 for all students majoring in our various programs at the time (24 \nstudents attended). In both settings, students were given a presentation of the proposed changes, \nand were offered the opportunity to ask questions and raise concerns. Students’ comments at the \ntown hall meeting were recorded on site. In addition, students in both settings were encouraged \nto complete an online questionnaire about the proposed degree, asking them to comment on what \nthey like about the new MLCS major, and how it could be improved. We also asked them to rate \ntheir agreement with the following statement on a five-point scale: “The new MLCS major, as \nexplained to me, would meet my expectations of a university degree in Modern Languages and \nCultural Studies” (with one being “strongly disagree” and five indicating “strongly agree”). We \nreceived a total of 235 responses to the online questionnaire (26.64% response rate). With \nrespect to the statement above, it received a 3.94 (out of 5) average rating, indicating a high level \nof support for the proposed major in MLCS. \nQualitative comments were overwhelmingly positive, emphasizing the focus on study abroad and \nexperiential learning, the opportunity to combine several languages or to take the cross-cultural \nroute, and the new major’s increased flexibility and simplification of requirements. Students also \nperceived the new capstone course as a valuable asset when applying for graduate studies. \nMoreover, they applauded the new major for buoying the smaller language areas, encouraging \nincreased interconnectedness in MLCS, and creating a community within the department rather \nthan just within certain disciplines. \n2.3 Describe your institution’s plans to assist active students, if any remain, in completing \ngraduation requirements during the suspension period, including information about formal \ncommunication and student advising plans.  \nActive students in the combined major in French and Spanish will be able to finish their studies \nand receive their Bachelor of Arts. Assuming the proposed major in Modern Languages and \nCultural Studies goes into effect in September 2019, there will be no further admission to the \ncombined major in French and Spanish effective the 2019 academic year. Subject to government \napprovals of the proposed MLCS and these suspensions, students who entered the combined \nmajor in French and Spanish program prior to September 2019 would then be asked to complete \n5 \nall program requirements by April 30, 2024 and the last degree with a combined major in French \nand Spanish will be granted at Spring Convocation 2024. If any active students in the initial \nstages of the combined major in French and Spanish studies would like to switch to the new \nmajor in Modern Languages and Cultural Studies, they may opt to do so and follow the \nrequirements of the new major.  \n2.4 Describe your institution’s plans to accommodate stop-out students, if any have been \nidentified, including information about formal communication plans. \nStop-out students who have started a combined major in French and Spanish prior to September \n2019 and return to finish their degree after 2019 may opt to switch to the new major in Modern \nLanguages and Cultural Studies and follow the requirements of the new major. \nSECTION 3: IMPACT  \n3.1 Identify which stakeholder groups were consulted: \n☑  Faculty \n☐  Regulatory and other Accreditation \nBodies \n☐  Employers and Professional \nAssociations  \n☐  Advisory Committee(s) \n☑  Other (identify below) \nOther:  \n- Division of German, Russian, Arabic Languages and Muslim Cultures (School of \nLanguages, Linguistics, Literatures and Cultures), University of Calgary \n- Department of Modern Languages, University of Lethbridge \n- Department of East Asian Studies, University of Alberta \n- Community Service-Learning, Faculty of Arts, University of Alberta \n- University of Alberta International, University of Alberta \n- OASIS (Organization of Arts Students and Interdisciplinary Studies), University of \nAlberta \n- Augustana Campus, University of Alberta \n- Art Gallery of Alberta \n6 \n3.1.1 Describe the consultation process conducted with these stakeholders and summarize the \nfeedback received. \nFaculty consultations: \nFollowing the suspension of ten MLCS majors by the Dean of the Faculty of Arts in August \n2013 due to persistently low enrollments, the MLCS curriculum committee prepared a proposal \nfor a new major in Modern Languages and Cultural Studies. After a year-long process to develop \nand refine the proposal, the curriculum committee presented it to departmental colleagues, both \nin small groups corresponding to existing major programs and at regular departmental meetings. \nThe chair of the curriculum committee also met with many groups and with individual faculty \nmembers to solicit their feedback. This work continued in Fall 2014, resulting in several minor \nchanges to the proposed major, which the department voted to adopt in October and November \n2014. Based on feedback from various levels of the university administration (the Faculty of Arts \nDean’s office, Academic Affairs Committee), the proposal was further refined. The final course \nand calendar changes were approved at the MLCS department council on February 13, 2017, and \nby Arts Faculty Council on May 25, 2017. \nOther consultations: \nFollowing the approval of the proposal at the MLCS departmental council, letters of support \nwere solicited from external stakeholders within Campus Alberta (U Lethbridge, U Calgary) as \nwell as internal stakeholders at the University of Alberta (Department of East Asian Studies, \nUAI, CSL, Augustana Campus, OASIS). We also received a letter of support from the Art \nGallery of Alberta. \nFeedback was unanimously positive and all stakeholders unreservedly endorsed the new \nmajor. U Calgary mentioned that they are actually pursuing a very similar avenue for their own \nprograms. U Lethbridge applauded the general requirements of the new major, requiring a \ncommon introductory course for all students which equips them with the necessary theoretical \ntools for their studies, and bringing it all together in the capstone course at the end of their \ndegree. East Asian Studies, having just completed a similar amalgamation of their single \nlanguage-based majors into a new East Asian Studies major, praised the flexibility of the new \nMLCS major and its reflection of best practices from other universities across North America to \ncreate a new major that is innovative, user-friendly, and marketable to today’s students. CSL, \nUAI, and Augustana Campus enthusiastically commended the formal integration of experiential \nlearning and study abroad opportunities into the new major, promoting deeper academic learning \nand enhanced intercultural capacities for our graduating students, thus providing them with real \nlife experiences and contacts when they enter the job market. OASIS applauded the increased \nflexibility of the new major, the benefits of experiential learning, study abroad, and the new \ncapstone course, and explicitly mentioned that sufficient student consultation had taken place. \nAll of the letters consistently acclaimed the increased focus on interdisciplinary analysis, while \ngiving students the choice of focusing either on one language or pursuing a more cross-cultural \napproach, as well as the integration of experiential learning and study abroad into the new major. \n7 \n3.2 Identify financial impacts and plans for reallocation of internal resources, particularly staff \nand classroom and lab space.     \nInternal reallocation is from current resources used to support the existing programs in MLCS. \nThe impact of this reallocation on the institution’s operations and overall financial position \nshould be negligible. There will be no impact on classroom or lab space. \nSECTION B: SUSPENSION EXTENSION \nSECTION 1: RATIONALE \n1.1 Describe the rationale for original suspension request. (Attach ministry approval letter for the \noriginal suspension.) \n1.1.1 Explain why the extension is needed and include supporting evidence (e.g., active \nstudents have not completed graduation requirements). \n1.2 If there are students still in the program, describe how they will be supported to complete \ngraduation requirements while the suspension is in place. \n1.3 Explain how the duration of the suspension extension was determined. \nOTHER CONSIDERATIONS \nPlease indicate if there are additional factors you would like the ministry to consider when \nreviewing this proposal. \nRECOMMENDATION (FOR DEPARTMENT USE) \n Recommendation(s) \n8 \nRationale for Recommendation:  \n Reviewer(s) \n Date Completed \n1 \nProposal Template:  Program Suspension and Extension of \nSuspension                                                                        \nUse this template for proposals to suspend approved programs or specializations or to propose an \nextension to a current suspension.  \nFill in the section below that is relevant to your proposal: \n● Section A: if you are proposing a suspension of a ministry-approved program or \nspecialization; \n● Section B: if you are proposing an extension to a suspension previously approved by \nthe ministry which is still in effect for a program or specialization; \nBasic Information (all proposals must complete this section) \nInstitution  University of Alberta \nProgram/specialization name Honors in Romance Languages  \nCredential awarded Bachelor of Arts \nProposed start date of \nsuspension  \nUpon approval of the proposed Bachelor of \nArts in Modern Languages and Cultural \nStudies - Tentative Suspension Date July 1, \n2019 \nProposed end date of suspension \nFive years after the proposed start date of the \nsuspension. Tentative end date June 30, 2024 \nSECTION A: PROGRAM SUSPENSION \nSECTION 1:  RATIONALE \n1.1 Identify the purpose for the suspension with supporting rationale and evidence (e.g., low \nstudent demand, declining labour market demand, institutional capacity, need for program \nredevelopment, quality assurance review recommendation, etc.). \nThe rationale for suspending the Honors in Romance Languages in the Department of Modern \nLanguages and Cultural Studies is that the department proposes to consolidate all currently \nexisting major programs into one single major in Modern Languages and Cultural Studies. The \nproposed new major will provide a more interdisciplinary approach to the teaching of languages, \nliteratures, and cultures, allow students to engage with more than one area of the department \n2 \nmore effectively than they can in the current language-based and compartmentalized majors, and \nmake it easier for students to study multiple languages.  \nStudents who wish to focus on Romance Languages in the new major will be able to do so in the \nproposed MLCS major.  \nThe proposed suspension and ultimate termination of the combined major in Honors in Romance \nLanguages is a necessary administrative step.  \n1.1.1 Document enrolments (by FLE and headcounts) for the most recent 5-year period, \nincluding the current academic year if available. \nHonors in Romance Languages  \n1.1.2 Indicate when admissions into program/specialization will be or were closed. \nSubject to government approval, the proposed major in Modern Languages and Cultural Studies \nwill be available for students in Fall 2019. At that point, there will be no further admission to the \nHonors in Romance Languages. Active students who entered the Honors in Romance Languages \nprior to September 2019 will be taught out and able to finish their studies in the current program \nand receive their Bachelor of Arts. They would be asked to complete all program requirements \nby April 30, 2024 and the last degree with an Honors in Romance Languages will be granted at \nSpring Convocation 2024. If any active students in the initial stages of the Honors in Romance \nLanguages would like to switch to the new major in Modern Languages and Cultural Studies, \nthey may opt to do so and follow the requirements of the new major.  \n1.1.3  Explain how the proposed end date of the suspension was determined.  \nEnrolment 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 \nTotal head count 3 4 4 1 0 \n Full-Time Year 1 1 0 0 0 0 \n Full-Time Year 2 0 1 0 0 0 \n Full-Time Year 3 1 2 1 0 0 \n Full-Time Year 4 1 1 3 1 0 \nTotal FLE 3 3.3 4.4 0.5 0 \n FLE Year 1 0.5 0 0 0 0 \n FLE Year 2 0.4 0.4 0 0 0 \n FLE Year 3 1.1 1.6 0.7 0 0 \n FLE Year 4 1 1.3 3.7 0.5 0 \n3 \nThe proposed end date is dependent on the approval of the MLCS major. We hope that the \nsuspension of the current majors will be implemented by July 1, 2019 with a proposed end date \n(dependent on government approvals) of June 30, 2024. This allows students who enrolled in the \nHonors in Romance Languages before Sept. 2019 to finish their degree. At the end date of the \nsuspension, the Honors in Romance Languages will be terminated. \n1.1.4 Provide specific information about which internal governance body approved the \nsuspension, and provide date of approval. (Attach copy of minutes or motions.) \nOn May 25, 2017 Arts Faculty Council (AFC) approved the proposed MLCS major and the \nsuspensions of all current majors (item 13.1, see attached minutes).  \n1.2 Check the applicable box to specify the longer-term plan. \n☑  To terminate the program.  \n☐  To reactivate the program.  \nSECTION 2: ACCESS \n2.1 Identify potential student access considerations and risks for Campus Alberta that the \nsuspension of this program could pose (include both (a) information about related programs \navailable to prospective students internally at your institution; and (b) externally at other \nAlberta institutions). \nStudents will be able to focus on Romance Languages in the new major in Modern Languages \nand Cultural Studies and take the same courses that were available to them as part of the \nsuspended majors. Therefore, it has no implications externally at other Campus Alberta \ninstitutions. \n2.1.1 If the program or specialization is unique in the province, describe consultation within \nCampus Alberta to investigate feasibility of program/specialization transfer. \nConsultation within Campus Alberta occurred as part of the development of the proposal for the \nnew major in MLCS. No consultation regarding the suspension of existing majors was necessary \ndue to the fact that courses in these languages, literatures, and cultures will still be offered within \n4 \nthe proposed MLCS major. While the language majors may no longer exist, the institution will \nretain the capacity to offer language acquisition experiences in them through the MLCS major. \nStudents’ transcripts will allow them to show their language competencies.  \n2.2 Describe the consultation process that occurred with students at your institution regarding \nthis programming change. \nStudent feedback was solicited in various ways. In February and November 2016, respectively, \nthe proposed new major in Modern Languages and Cultural Studies was presented to a total of \n882 (362 and 520) students during class visits (858 students enrolled in 29 different classes, \nselected to represent a cross-section of all of our programs) and at a special town hall meeting \nheld on February 25, 2016 for all students majoring in our various programs at the time (24 \nstudents attended). In both settings, students were given a presentation of the proposed changes, \nand were offered the opportunity to ask questions and raise concerns. Students’ comments at the \ntown hall meeting were recorded on site. In addition, students in both settings were encouraged \nto complete an online questionnaire about the proposed degree, asking them to comment on what \nthey like about the new MLCS major, and how it could be improved. We also asked them to rate \ntheir agreement with the following statement on a five-point scale: “The new MLCS major, as \nexplained to me, would meet my expectations of a university degree in Modern Languages and \nCultural Studies” (with one being “strongly disagree” and five indicating “strongly agree”). We \nreceived a total of 235 responses to the online questionnaire (26.64% response rate). With \nrespect to the statement above, it received a 3.94 (out of 5) average rating, indicating a high level \nof support for the proposed major in MLCS. \nQualitative comments were overwhelmingly positive, emphasizing the focus on study abroad and \nexperiential learning, the opportunity to combine several languages or to take the cross-cultural \nroute, and the new major’s increased flexibility and simplification of requirements. Students also \nperceived the new capstone course as a valuable asset when applying for graduate studies. \nMoreover, they applauded the new major for buoying the smaller language areas, encouraging \nincreased interconnectedness in MLCS, and creating a community within the department rather \nthan just within certain disciplines. \n2.3 Describe your institution’s plans to assist active students, if any remain, in completing \ngraduation requirements during the suspension period, including information about formal \ncommunication and student advising plans.  \nActive students in the Honors in Romance Languages will be able to finish their studies and \nreceive their Bachelor of Arts. Assuming the proposed major in Modern Languages and Cultural \nStudies goes into effect in September 2019, there will be no further admission to the Honors in \nRomance Languages effective the 2019 academic year. Subject to government approvals of the \nproposed MLCS and these suspensions, students who entered the Honors in Romance Languages \n5 \nprogram prior to September 2019 would then be asked to complete all program requirements by \nApril 30, 2024 and the last degree with a Honors in Romance Languages will be granted at \nSpring Convocation 2024.

After a year-long process to develop \nand refine the proposal, the curriculum committee presented it to departmental colleagues, both \nin small groups corresponding to existing major programs and at regular departmental meetings. \nThe chair of the curriculum committee also met with many groups and with individual faculty \nmembers to solicit their feedback. This work continued in Fall 2014, resulting in several minor \nchanges to the proposed major, which the department voted to adopt in October and November \n2014. Based on feedback from various levels of the university administration (the Faculty of Arts \n7 \nDean’s office, Academic Affairs Committee), the proposal was further refined. The final course \nand calendar changes were approved at the MLCS department council on February 13, 2017, and \nby Arts Faculty Council on May 25, 2017. \nOther consultations: \nFollowing the approval of the proposal at the MLCS departmental council, letters of support \nwere solicited from external stakeholders within Campus Alberta (U Lethbridge, U Calgary) as \nwell as internal stakeholders at the University of Alberta (Department of East Asian Studies, \nUAI, CSL, Augustana Campus, OASIS). We also received a letter of support from the Art \nGallery of Alberta. \nFeedback was unanimously positive and all stakeholders unreservedly endorsed the new \nmajor. U Calgary mentioned that they are actually pursuing a very similar avenue for their own \nprograms. U Lethbridge applauded the general requirements of the new major, requiring a \ncommon introductory course for all students which equips them with the necessary theoretical \ntools for their studies, and bringing it all together in the capstone course at the end of their \ndegree. East Asian Studies, having just completed a similar amalgamation of their single \nlanguage-based majors into a new East Asian Studies major, praised the flexibility of the new \nMLCS major and its reflection of best practices from other universities across North America to \ncreate a new major that is innovative, user-friendly, and marketable to today’s students. CSL, \nUAI, and Augustana Campus enthusiastically commended the formal integration of experiential \nlearning and study abroad opportunities into the new major, promoting deeper academic learning \nand enhanced intercultural capacities for our graduating students, thus providing them with real \nlife experiences and contacts when they enter the job market. OASIS applauded the increased \nflexibility of the new major, the benefits of experiential learning, study abroad, and the new \ncapstone course, and explicitly mentioned that sufficient student consultation had taken place. \nAll of the letters consistently acclaimed the increased focus on interdisciplinary analysis, while \ngiving students the choice of focusing either on one language or pursuing a more cross-cultural \napproach, as well as the integration of experiential learning and study abroad into the new major. \n3.2 Identify financial impacts and plans for reallocation of internal resources, particularly staff \nand classroom and lab space.     \nInternal reallocation is from current resources used to support the existing programs in MLCS. \nThe impact of this reallocation on the institution’s operations and overall financial position \nshould be negligible. There will be no impact on classroom or lab space. \nSECTION B: SUSPENSION EXTENSION \nSECTION 1: RATIONALE \n8 \n1.1 Describe the rationale for original suspension request. (Attach ministry approval letter for the \noriginal suspension.) \n1.1.1 Explain why the extension is needed and include supporting evidence (e.g., active \nstudents have not completed graduation requirements). \n1.2 If there are students still in the program, describe how they will be supported to complete \ngraduation requirements while the suspension is in place. \n1.3 Explain how the duration of the suspension extension was determined. \nOTHER CONSIDERATIONS \nPlease indicate if there are additional factors you would like the ministry to consider when \nreviewing this proposal. \nRECOMMENDATION (FOR DEPARTMENT USE) \n Recommendation(s) \nRationale for Recommendation:  \n Reviewer(s) \n Date Completed \n1 \nProposal Template:  Program Suspension and Extension of \nSuspension                                                                        \nUse this template for proposals to suspend approved programs or specializations or to propose an \nextension to a current suspension.  \nFill in the section below that is relevant to your proposal: \n● Section A: if you are proposing a suspension of a ministry-approved program or \nspecialization; \n● Section B: if you are proposing an extension to a suspension previously approved by \nthe ministry which is still in effect for a program or specialization; \nBasic Information (all proposals must complete this section) \nInstitution  University of Alberta \nProgram/specialization name \nFrench, Honors in French, Combined Honors \nin French  \nCredential awarded Bachelor of Arts \nProposed start date of \nsuspension  \nUpon approval of the proposed Bachelor of \nArts in Modern Languages and Cultural \nStudies - Tentative Suspension Date July 1, \n2019 \nProposed end date of suspension \nFive years after the proposed start date of the \nsuspension. Tentative end date June 30, 2024 \nSECTION A: PROGRAM SUSPENSION \nSECTION 1:  RATIONALE \n1.1 Identify the purpose for the suspension with supporting rationale and evidence (e.g., low \nstudent demand, declining labour market demand, institutional capacity, need for program \nredevelopment, quality assurance review recommendation, etc.). \nThe rationale for suspending the major in French, Honors in French, and Combined Honors in \nFrench in the Department of Modern Languages and Cultural Studies is that the department \nproposes to consolidate all currently existing major programs into one single major in Modern \nLanguages and Cultural Studies. The proposed new major will provide a more interdisciplinary \napproach to the teaching of languages, literatures, and cultures, allow students to engage with \n2 \nmore than one area of the department more effectively than they can in the current language-\nbased and compartmentalized majors, and make it easier for students to study multiple \nlanguages.  \nStudents who wish to focus on French in the new major will be able to do so in the proposed \nMLCS major.  \nThe proposed suspension and ultimate termination of the major in French, Honors in French, and \nCombined Honors in French is a necessary administrative step.  \n1.1.1 Document enrolments (by FLE and headcounts) for the most recent 5-year period, \nincluding the current academic year if available. \nMajor in French \nHonors in French \nEnrolment 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 \nTotal head count 32 28 27 35 36 \n Full-Time Year 1 2 6 4 9 9 \n Full-Time Year 2 10 5 6 4 7 \n Full-Time Year 3 5 8 8 9 7 \n Full-Time Year 4 15 9 9 13 13 \nTotal FLE 26.3 22.9 21.5 26.4 28.2 \n FLE Year 1 1.5 4.2 1.3 5.8 6.3 \n FLE Year 2 7.2 5.1 4.3 4.4 4.7 \n FLE Year 3 4.9 5.6 7.2 7 6.7 \n FLE Year 4 12.7 8 8.7 9.2 10.5 \nEnrolment 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 \nTotal head count 3 3 2 1 1 \n Full-Time Year 1 0 0 0 0 0 \n Full-Time Year 2 2 2 0 0 1 \n Full-Time Year 3 0 1 1 0 0 \n Full-Time Year 4 1 0 1 1 0 \nTotal FLE 2.2 2.5 1.7 0.8 1.2 \n FLE Year 1 0 0 0 0 0 \n FLE Year 2 0.5 1.4 0.2 0 0 \n3 \nCombined Honors in French: currently no enrolments \n1.1.2 Indicate when admissions into program/specialization will be or were closed. \nSubject to government approval, the proposed major in Modern Languages and Cultural Studies \nwill be available for students in Fall 2019. At that point, there will be no further admission to the \nmajor in French, Honors in French, or Combined Honors in French. Active students who entered \nthe major in French, Honors in French, or Combined Honors in French prior to September 2019 \nwill be taught out and able to finish their studies in the current program and receive their \nBachelor of Arts. They would be asked to complete all program requirements by April 30, 2024 \nand the last degree with a major in French, Honors in French, or Combined Honors in French \nwill be granted at Spring Convocation 2024. If any active students in the initial stages of the \nmajor in French, Honors in French, or Combined Honors in French would like to switch to the \nnew major in Modern Languages and Cultural Studies, they may opt to do so and follow the \nrequirements of the new major.  \n1.1.3  Explain how the proposed end date of the suspension was determined.  \nThe proposed end date is dependent on the approval of the MLCS major. We hope that the \nsuspension of the current majors will be implemented by July 1, 2019 with a proposed end date \n(dependent on government approvals) of June 30, 2024. This allows students who enrolled in the \nmajor in French, Honors in French, and Combined Honors in French before Sept. 2019 to finish \ntheir degree. At the end date of the suspension, the major in French, Honors in French, and \nCombined Honors in French will be terminated. \n1.1.4 Provide specific information about which internal governance body approved the \nsuspension, and provide date of approval. (Attach copy of minutes or motions.) \nOn May 25, 2017 Arts Faculty Council (AFC) approved the proposed MLCS major and the \nsuspensions of all current majors (item 13.1, see attached minutes).  \n1.2 Check the applicable box to specify the longer-term plan. \n☑  To terminate the program.  \n FLE Year 3 1.3 0.5 0.8 0 0 \n FLE Year 4 0.4 0.6 0.7 0.8 0.1 \n4 \n☐  To reactivate the program.  \nSECTION 2: ACCESS \n2.1 Identify potential student access considerations and risks for Campus Alberta that the \nsuspension of this program could pose (include both (a) information about related programs \navailable to prospective students internally at your institution; and (b) externally at other \nAlberta institutions). \nStudents will be able to focus on French in the new major in Modern Languages and Cultural \nStudies and take the same courses that were available to them as part of the suspended majors. \nTherefore, it has no implications externally at other Campus Alberta institutions. \n2.1.1 If the program or specialization is unique in the province, describe consultation within \nCampus Alberta to investigate feasibility of program/specialization transfer. \nConsultation within Campus Alberta occurred as part of the development of the proposal for the \nnew major in MLCS. No consultation regarding the suspension of existing majors was necessary \ndue to the fact that courses in these languages, literatures, and cultures will still be offered within \nthe proposed MLCS major. While the language majors may no longer exist, the institution will \nretain the capacity to offer language acquisition experiences in them through the MLCS major. \nStudents’ transcripts will allow them to show their language competencies.  \n2.2 Describe the consultation process that occurred with students at your institution regarding \nthis programming change. \nStudent feedback was solicited in various ways. In February and November 2016, respectively, \nthe proposed new major in Modern Languages and Cultural Studies was presented to a total of \n882 (362 and 520) students during class visits (858 students enrolled in 29 different classes, \nselected to represent a cross-section of all of our programs) and at a special town hall meeting \nheld on February 25, 2016 for all students majoring in our various programs at the time (24 \nstudents attended). In both settings, students were given a presentation of the proposed changes, \nand were offered the opportunity to ask questions and raise concerns. Students’ comments at the \ntown hall meeting were recorded on site. In addition, students in both settings were encouraged \nto complete an online questionnaire about the proposed degree, asking them to comment on what \nthey like about the new MLCS major, and how it could be improved. We also asked them to rate \ntheir agreement with the following statement on a five-point scale: “The new MLCS major, as \nexplained to me, would meet my expectations of a university degree in Modern Languages and \n5 \nCultural Studies” (with one being “strongly disagree” and five indicating “strongly agree”). We \nreceived a total of 235 responses to the online questionnaire (26.64% response rate). With \nrespect to the statement above, it received a 3.94 (out of 5) average rating, indicating a high level \nof support for the proposed major in MLCS. \nQualitative comments were overwhelmingly positive, emphasizing the focus on study abroad and \nexperiential learning, the opportunity to combine several languages or to take the cross-cultural \nroute, and the new major’s increased flexibility and simplification of requirements. Students also \nperceived the new capstone course as a valuable asset when applying for graduate studies. \nMoreover, they applauded the new major for buoying the smaller language areas, encouraging \nincreased interconnectedness in MLCS, and creating a community within the department rather \nthan just within certain disciplines. \n2.3 Describe your institution’s plans to assist active students, if any remain, in completing \ngraduation requirements during the suspension period, including information about formal \ncommunication and student advising plans.  \nActive students in the major in French, Honors in French, and Combined Honors in French will \nbe able to finish their studies and receive their Bachelor of Arts. Assuming the proposed major in \nModern Languages and Cultural Studies goes into effect in September 2019, there will be no \nfurther admission to the major in French, Honors in French, and Combined Honors in French \neffective the 2019 academic year. Subject to government approvals of the proposed MLCS and \nthese suspensions, students who entered the French program prior to September 2019 would then \nbe asked to complete all program requirements by April 30, 2024 and the last degree with a \nmajor in French, Honors in French, or Combined Honors in French will be granted at Spring \nConvocation 2024.

If any active students in the initial stages of their German \nstudies would like to switch to the new major in Modern Languages and Cultural Studies, they \nmay opt to do so and follow the requirements of the new major.  \n2.4 Describe your institution’s plans to accommodate stop-out students, if any have been \nidentified, including information about formal communication plans. \nStop-out students who have started a major in German, Honors in German, or Combined Honors \nin German prior to September 2019 and return to finish their degree after 2019 may opt to switch \nto the new major in Modern Languages and Cultural Studies and follow the requirements of the \nnew major. \nSECTION 3: IMPACT  \n3.1 Identify which stakeholder groups were consulted: \n☑  Faculty \n6 \n☐  Regulatory and other Accreditation \nBodies \n☐  Employers and Professional \nAssociations  \n☐  Advisory Committee(s) \n☑  Other (identify below) \nOther:  \n- Division of German, Russian, Arabic Languages and Muslim Cultures (School of \nLanguages, Linguistics, Literatures and Cultures), University of Calgary \n- Department of Modern Languages, University of Lethbridge \n- Department of East Asian Studies, University of Alberta \n- Community Service-Learning, Faculty of Arts, University of Alberta \n- University of Alberta International, University of Alberta \n- OASIS (Organization of Arts Students and Interdisciplinary Studies), University of \nAlberta \n- Augustana Campus, University of Alberta \n- Art Gallery of Alberta \n3.1.1 Describe the consultation process conducted with these stakeholders and summarize the \nfeedback received. \nFaculty consultations: \nFollowing the suspension of ten MLCS majors by the Dean of the Faculty of Arts in August \n2013 due to persistently low enrollments, the MLCS curriculum committee prepared a proposal \nfor a new major in Modern Languages and Cultural Studies. After a year-long process to develop \nand refine the proposal, the curriculum committee presented it to departmental colleagues, both \nin small groups corresponding to existing major programs and at regular departmental meetings. \nThe chair of the curriculum committee also met with many groups and with individual faculty \nmembers to solicit their feedback. This work continued in Fall 2014, resulting in several minor \nchanges to the proposed major, which the department voted to adopt in October and November \n2014. Based on feedback from various levels of the university administration (the Faculty of Arts \nDean’s office, Academic Affairs Committee), the proposal was further refined. The final course \nand calendar changes were approved at the MLCS department council on February 13, 2017, and \nby Arts Faculty Council on May 25, 2017. \n7 \nOther consultations: \nFollowing the approval of the proposal at the MLCS departmental council, letters of support \nwere solicited from external stakeholders within Campus Alberta (U Lethbridge, U Calgary) as \nwell as internal stakeholders at the University of Alberta (Department of East Asian Studies, \nUAI, CSL, Augustana Campus, OASIS). We also received a letter of support from the Art \nGallery of Alberta. \nFeedback was unanimously positive and all stakeholders unreservedly endorsed the new \nmajor. U Calgary mentioned that they are actually pursuing a very similar avenue for their own \nprograms. U Lethbridge applauded the general requirements of the new major, requiring a \ncommon introductory course for all students which equips them with the necessary theoretical \ntools for their studies, and bringing it all together in the capstone course at the end of their \ndegree. East Asian Studies, having just completed a similar amalgamation of their single \nlanguage-based majors into a new East Asian Studies major, praised the flexibility of the new \nMLCS major and its reflection of best practices from other universities across North America to \ncreate a new major that is innovative, user-friendly, and marketable to today’s students. CSL, \nUAI, and Augustana Campus enthusiastically commended the formal integration of experiential \nlearning and study abroad opportunities into the new major, promoting deeper academic learning \nand enhanced intercultural capacities for our graduating students, thus providing them with real \nlife experiences and contacts when they enter the job market. OASIS applauded the increased \nflexibility of the new major, the benefits of experiential learning, study abroad, and the new \ncapstone course, and explicitly mentioned that sufficient student consultation had taken place. \nAll of the letters consistently acclaimed the increased focus on interdisciplinary analysis, while \ngiving students the choice of focusing either on one language or pursuing a more cross-cultural \napproach, as well as the integration of experiential learning and study abroad into the new major. \n3.2 Identify financial impacts and plans for reallocation of internal resources, particularly staff \nand classroom and lab space.     \nInternal reallocation is from current resources used to support the existing programs in MLCS. \nThe impact of this reallocation on the institution’s operations and overall financial position \nshould be negligible. There will be no impact on classroom or lab space. \nSECTION B: SUSPENSION EXTENSION \nSECTION 1: RATIONALE \n1.1 Describe the rationale for original suspension request. (Attach ministry approval letter for the \noriginal suspension.) \n8 \n1.1.1 Explain why the extension is needed and include supporting evidence (e.g., active \nstudents have not completed graduation requirements). \n1.2 If there are students still in the program, describe how they will be supported to complete \ngraduation requirements while the suspension is in place. \n1.3 Explain how the duration of the suspension extension was determined. \nOTHER CONSIDERATIONS \nPlease indicate if there are additional factors you would like the ministry to consider when \nreviewing this proposal. \nRECOMMENDATION (FOR DEPARTMENT USE) \n Recommendation(s) \nRationale for Recommendation:  \n Reviewer(s) \n Date Completed \n1 \nProposal Template:  Program Suspension and Extension of \nSuspension                                                                        \nUse this template for proposals to suspend approved programs or specializations or to propose an \nextension to a current suspension.  \nFill in the section below that is relevant to your proposal: \n● Section A: if you are proposing a suspension of a ministry-approved program or \nspecialization; \n● Section B: if you are proposing an extension to a suspension previously approved by \nthe ministry which is still in effect for a program or specialization; \nBasic Information (all proposals must complete this section) \nInstitution  University of Alberta \nProgram/specialization name \nLatin American Studies, Honors in Spanish \nand Latin American Studies  \nCredential awarded Bachelor of Arts \nProposed start date of \nsuspension  \nUpon approval of the proposed Bachelor of \nArts in Modern Languages and Cultural \nStudies - Tentative Suspension Date July 1, \n2019 \nProposed end date of suspension \nFive years after the proposed start date of the \nsuspension. Tentative end date June 30, 2024 \nSECTION A: PROGRAM SUSPENSION \nSECTION 1:  RATIONALE \n1.1 Identify the purpose for the suspension with supporting rationale and evidence (e.g., low \nstudent demand, declining labour market demand, institutional capacity, need for program \nredevelopment, quality assurance review recommendation, etc.). \nThe rationale for suspending the major in Latin American Studies and Honors in Spanish and \nLatin American Studies in the Department of Modern Languages and Cultural Studies is that the \ndepartment proposes to consolidate all currently existing major programs into one single major \nin Modern Languages and Cultural Studies. The proposed new major will provide a more \ninterdisciplinary approach to the teaching of languages, literatures, and cultures, allow students \n2 \nto engage with more than one area of the department more effectively than they can in the \ncurrent language-based and compartmentalized majors, and make it easier for students to study \nmultiple languages.  \nStudents who wish to focus on Latin American Studies in the new major will be able to do so in \nthe proposed MLCS major.  \nThe proposed suspension and ultimate termination of the major in Latin American Studies and \nHonors in Spanish and Latin American Studies is a necessary administrative step.  \n1.1.1 Document enrolments (by FLE and headcounts) for the most recent 5-year period, \nincluding the current academic year if available. \nMajor in Latin American Studies \nHonors in Spanish and Latin American Studies  \nEnrolment 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 \nTotal head count 2 1 3 3 4 \n Full-Time Year 1 0 0 0 0 2 \n Full-Time Year 2 2 0 0 1 1 \n Full-Time Year 3 0 0 1 0 1 \n Full-Time Year 4 0 1 2 2 0 \nTotal FLE 2.5 1 2.1 2.4 2.6 \n FLE Year 1 0 0 0 0.4 1 \n FLE Year 2 1.8 0.1 0.1 0.8 0.9 \n FLE Year 3 0.5 0.1 0.8 0 0.2 \n FLE Year 4 0.2 0.8 1.2 1.2 0.5 \nEnrolment 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 \nTotal head count 1 3 5 5 2 \n Full-Time Year 1 0 1 1 0 1 \n Full-Time Year 2 0 0 0 0 0 \n Full-Time Year 3 1 2 1 1 0 \n Full-Time Year 4 0 0 3 4 1 \nTotal FLE 0 0 0 0 0 \n FLE Year 1 0 0 0 0 0 \n FLE Year 2 0 0 0 0 0 \n3 \n1.1.2 Indicate when admissions into program/specialization will be or were closed. \nSubject to government approval, the proposed major in Modern Languages and Cultural Studies \nwill be available for students in Fall 2019. At that point, there will be no further admission to the \nmajor in Latin American Studies or Honors in Spanish and Latin American Studies. Active \nstudents who entered the major in Latin American Studies or Honors in Spanish and Latin \nAmerican Studies prior to September 2019 will be taught out and able to finish their studies in \nthe current program and receive their Bachelor of Arts. They would be asked to complete all \nprogram requirements by April 30, 2024 and the last degree with a major in Latin American \nStudies or Honors in Spanish and Latin American Studies will be granted at Spring Convocation \n2024. If any active students in the initial stages of the major in Latin American Studies or Honors \nin Spanish and Latin American Studies would like to switch to the new major in Modern \nLanguages and Cultural Studies, they may opt to do so and follow the requirements of the new \nmajor.  \n1.1.3  Explain how the proposed end date of the suspension was determined.  \nThe proposed end date is dependent on the approval of the MLCS major. We hope that the \nsuspension of the current majors will be implemented by July 1, 2019 with a proposed end date \n(dependent on government approvals) of June 30, 2024. This allows students who enrolled in the \nmajor in Latin American Studies and Honors in Spanish and Latin American Studies before Sept. \n2019 to finish their degree. At the end date of the suspension, the major in Latin American \nStudies and Honors in Spanish and Latin American Studies will be terminated. \n1.1.4 Provide specific information about which internal governance body approved the \nsuspension, and provide date of approval. (Attach copy of minutes or motions.) \nOn May 25, 2017 Arts Faculty Council (AFC) approved the proposed MLCS major and the \nsuspensions of all current majors (item 13.1, see attached minutes).  \n1.2 Check the applicable box to specify the longer-term plan. \n☑  To terminate the program.  \n☐  To reactivate the program.  \n FLE Year 3 0 0 0 0 0 \n FLE Year 4 0 0 0 0 0 \n4 \nSECTION 2: ACCESS \n2.1 Identify potential student access considerations and risks for Campus Alberta that the \nsuspension of this program could pose (include both (a) information about related programs \navailable to prospective students internally at your institution; and (b) externally at other \nAlberta institutions). \nStudents will be able to focus on Latin American Studies in the new major in Modern Languages \nand Cultural Studies and take the same courses that were available to them as part of the \nsuspended majors. Therefore, it has no implications externally at other Campus Alberta \ninstitutions. \n2.1.1 If the program or specialization is unique in the province, describe consultation within \nCampus Alberta to investigate feasibility of program/specialization transfer. \nConsultation within Campus Alberta occurred as part of the development of the proposal for the \nnew major in MLCS. No consultation regarding the suspension of existing majors was necessary \ndue to the fact that courses in these languages, literatures, and cultures will still be offered within \nthe proposed MLCS major. While the language majors may no longer exist, the institution will \nretain the capacity to offer language acquisition experiences in them through the MLCS major. \nStudents’ transcripts will allow them to show their language competencies.  \n2.2 Describe the consultation process that occurred with students at your institution regarding \nthis programming change. \nStudent feedback was solicited in various ways. In February and November 2016, respectively, \nthe proposed new major in Modern Languages and Cultural Studies was presented to a total of \n882 (362 and 520) students during class visits (858 students enrolled in 29 different classes, \nselected to represent a cross-section of all of our programs) and at a special town hall meeting \nheld on February 25, 2016 for all students majoring in our various programs at the time (24 \nstudents attended). In both settings, students were given a presentation of the proposed changes, \nand were offered the opportunity to ask questions and raise concerns. Students’ comments at the \ntown hall meeting were recorded on site. In addition, students in both settings were encouraged \nto complete an online questionnaire about the proposed degree, asking them to comment on what \nthey like about the new MLCS major, and how it could be improved. We also asked them to rate \ntheir agreement with the following statement on a five-point scale: “The new MLCS major, as \nexplained to me, would meet my expectations of a university degree in Modern Languages and \nCultural Studies” (with one being “strongly disagree” and five indicating “strongly agree”). We \n5 \nreceived a total of 235 responses to the online questionnaire (26.64% response rate). With \nrespect to the statement above, it received a 3.94 (out of 5) average rating, indicating a high level \nof support for the proposed major in MLCS. \nQualitative comments were overwhelmingly positive, emphasizing the focus on study abroad and \nexperiential learning, the opportunity to combine several languages or to take the cross-cultural \nroute, and the new major’s increased flexibility and simplification of requirements. Students also \nperceived the new capstone course as a valuable asset when applying for graduate studies. \nMoreover, they applauded the new major for buoying the smaller language areas, encouraging \nincreased interconnectedness in MLCS, and creating a community within the department rather \nthan just within certain disciplines. \n2.3 Describe your institution’s plans to assist active students, if any remain, in completing \ngraduation requirements during the suspension period, including information about formal \ncommunication and student advising plans.  \nActive students in the major in Latin American Studies and Honors in Spanish and Latin \nAmerican Studies will be able to finish their studies and receive their Bachelor of Arts. \nAssuming the proposed major in Modern Languages and Cultural Studies goes into effect in \nSeptember 2019, there will be no further admission to the major in Latin American Studies and \nHonors in Spanish and Latin American Studies effective the 2019 academic year. Subject to \ngovernment approvals of the proposed MLCS and these suspensions, students who entered the \nLatin American Studies program prior to September 2019 would then be asked to complete all \nprogram requirements by April 30, 2024 and the last degree with a major in Latin American \nStudies or Honors in Spanish and Latin American Studies will be granted at Spring Convocation \n2024. If any active students in the initial stages of their Latin American Studies studies would \nlike to switch to the new major in Modern Languages and Cultural Studies, they may opt to do so \nand follow the requirements of the new major.  \n2.4 Describe your institution’s plans to accommodate stop-out students, if any have been \nidentified, including information about formal communication plans. \nStop-out students who have started a major in Latin American Studies or Honors in Spanish and \nLatin American Studies prior to September 2019 and return to finish their degree after 2019 may \nopt to switch to the new major in Modern Languages and Cultural Studies and follow the \nrequirements of the new major. \nSECTION 3: IMPACT  \n3.1 Identify which stakeholder groups were consulted: \n6 \n☑  Faculty \n☐  Regulatory and other Accreditation \nBodies \n☐  Employers and Professional \nAssociations  \n☐  Advisory Committee(s) \n☑  Other (identify below) \nOther:  \n- Division of German, Russian, Arabic Languages and Muslim Cultures (School of \nLanguages, Linguistics, Literatures and Cultures), University of Calgary \n- Department of Modern Languages, University of Lethbridge \n- Department of East Asian Studies, University of Alberta \n- Community Service-Learning, Faculty of Arts, University of Alberta \n- University of Alberta International, University of Alberta \n- OASIS (Organization of Arts Students and Interdisciplinary Studies), University of \nAlberta \n- Augustana Campus, University of Alberta \n- Art Gallery of Alberta \n3.1.1 Describe the consultation process conducted with these stakeholders and summarize the \nfeedback received. \nFaculty consultations: \nFollowing the suspension of ten MLCS majors by the Dean of the Faculty of Arts in August \n2013 due to persistently low enrollments, the MLCS curriculum committee prepared a proposal \nfor a new major in Modern Languages and Cultural Studies.

If any active students in the \ninitial stages of their Scandinavian Studies studies would like to switch to the new major in \nModern Languages and Cultural Studies, they may opt to do so and follow the requirements of \nthe new major.  \n2.4 Describe your institution’s plans to accommodate stop-out students, if any have been \nidentified, including information about formal communication plans. \nStop-out students who have started a major in Scandinavian Studies or Combined Honors in \nScandinavian Studies prior to September 2019 and return to finish their degree after 2019 may \nopt to switch to the new major in Modern Languages and Cultural Studies and follow the \nrequirements of the new major. \nSECTION 3: IMPACT  \n3.1 Identify which stakeholder groups were consulted: \n☑  Faculty ☐  Regulatory and other Accreditation \nBodies \n6 \n☐  Employers and Professional \nAssociations  \n☐  Advisory Committee(s) \n☑  Other (identify below) \nOther:  \n- Division of German, Russian, Arabic Languages and Muslim Cultures (School of \nLanguages, Linguistics, Literatures and Cultures), University of Calgary \n- Department of Modern Languages, University of Lethbridge \n- Department of East Asian Studies, University of Alberta \n- Community Service-Learning, Faculty of Arts, University of Alberta \n- University of Alberta International, University of Alberta \n- OASIS (Organization of Arts Students and Interdisciplinary Studies), University of \nAlberta \n- Augustana Campus, University of Alberta \n- Art Gallery of Alberta \n3.1.1 Describe the consultation process conducted with these stakeholders and summarize the \nfeedback received. \nFaculty consultations: \nFollowing the suspension of ten MLCS majors by the Dean of the Faculty of Arts in August \n2013 due to persistently low enrollments, the MLCS curriculum committee prepared a proposal \nfor a new major in Modern Languages and Cultural Studies. After a year-long process to develop \nand refine the proposal, the curriculum committee presented it to departmental colleagues, both \nin small groups corresponding to existing major programs and at regular departmental meetings. \nThe chair of the curriculum committee also met with many groups and with individual faculty \nmembers to solicit their feedback. This work continued in Fall 2014, resulting in several minor \nchanges to the proposed major, which the department voted to adopt in October and November \n2014. Based on feedback from various levels of the university administration (the Faculty of Arts \nDean’s office, Academic Affairs Committee), the proposal was further refined. The final course \nand calendar changes were approved at the MLCS department council on February 13, 2017, and \nby Arts Faculty Council on May 25, 2017. \nOther consultations: \nFollowing the approval of the proposal at the MLCS departmental council, letters of support \nwere solicited from external stakeholders within Campus Alberta (U Lethbridge, U Calgary) as \n7 \nwell as internal stakeholders at the University of Alberta (Department of East Asian Studies, \nUAI, CSL, Augustana Campus, OASIS). We also received a letter of support from the Art \nGallery of Alberta. \n Feedback was unanimously positive and all stakeholders unreservedly endorsed the new \nmajor. U Calgary mentioned that they are actually pursuing a very similar avenue for their own \nprograms. U Lethbridge applauded the general requirements of the new major, requiring a \ncommon introductory course for all students which equips them with the necessary theoretical \ntools for their studies, and bringing it all together in the capstone course at the end of their \ndegree. East Asian Studies, having just completed a similar amalgamation of their single \nlanguage-based majors into a new East Asian Studies major, praised the flexibility of the new \nMLCS major and its reflection of best practices from other universities across North America to \ncreate a new major that is innovative, user-friendly, and marketable to today’s students. CSL, \nUAI, and Augustana Campus enthusiastically commended the formal integration of experiential \nlearning and study abroad opportunities into the new major, promoting deeper academic learning \nand enhanced intercultural capacities for our graduating students, thus providing them with real \nlife experiences and contacts when they enter the job market. OASIS applauded the increased \nflexibility of the new major, the benefits of experiential learning, study abroad, and the new \ncapstone course, and explicitly mentioned that sufficient student consultation had taken place. \nAll of the letters consistently acclaimed the increased focus on interdisciplinary analysis, while \ngiving students the choice of focusing either on one language or pursuing a more cross-cultural \napproach, as well as the integration of experiential learning and study abroad into the new major. \n3.2 Identify financial impacts and plans for reallocation of internal resources, particularly staff \nand classroom and lab space.     \nInternal reallocation is from current resources used to support the existing programs in MLCS. \nThe impact of this reallocation on the institution’s operations and overall financial position \nshould be negligible. There will be no impact on classroom or lab space. \nSECTION B: SUSPENSION EXTENSION \nSECTION 1: RATIONALE \n1.1 Describe the rationale for original suspension request. (Attach ministry approval letter for the \noriginal suspension.) \n1.1.1 Explain why the extension is needed and include supporting evidence (e.g., active \nstudents have not completed graduation requirements). \n8 \n1.2 If there are students still in the program, describe how they will be supported to complete \ngraduation requirements while the suspension is in place. \n1.3 Explain how the duration of the suspension extension was determined. \nOTHER CONSIDERATIONS \nPlease indicate if there are additional factors you would like the ministry to consider when \nreviewing this proposal. \nRECOMMENDATION (FOR DEPARTMENT USE) \n Recommendation(s) \nRationale for Recommendation:  \n Reviewer(s) \n Date Completed \n1 \nProposal Template:  Program Suspension and Extension of \nSuspension                                                                        \nUse this template for proposals to suspend approved programs or specializations or to propose an \nextension to a current suspension.  \nFill in the section below that is relevant to your proposal: \n● Section A: if you are proposing a suspension of a ministry-approved program or \nspecialization; \n● Section B: if you are proposing an extension to a suspension previously approved by \nthe ministry which is still in effect for a program or specialization; \nBasic Information (all proposals must complete this section) \nInstitution  University of Alberta \nProgram/specialization name Spanish, Combined Honors in Spanish  \nCredential awarded Bachelor of Arts \nProposed start date of \nsuspension  \nUpon approval of the proposed Bachelor of \nArts in Modern Languages and Cultural \nStudies - Tentative Suspension Date July 1, \n2019 \nProposed end date of suspension \nFive years after the proposed start date of the \nsuspension. Tentative end date June 30, 2024 \nSECTION A: PROGRAM SUSPENSION \nSECTION 1:  RATIONALE \n1.1 Identify the purpose for the suspension with supporting rationale and evidence (e.g., low \nstudent demand, declining labour market demand, institutional capacity, need for program \nredevelopment, quality assurance review recommendation, etc.). \nThe rationale for suspending the major in Spanish and Combined Honors in Spanish in the \nDepartment of Modern Languages and Cultural Studies is that the department proposes to \nconsolidate all currently existing major programs into one single major in Modern Languages \nand Cultural Studies. The proposed new major will provide a more interdisciplinary approach to \nthe teaching of languages, literatures, and cultures, allow students to engage with more than one \n2 \narea of the department more effectively than they can in the current language-based and \ncompartmentalized majors, and make it easier for students to study multiple languages.  \nStudents who wish to focus on Spanish in the new major will be able to do so in the proposed \nMLCS major.  \nThe proposed suspension and ultimate termination of the major in Spanish and Combined \nHonors in Spanish is a necessary administrative step.  \n1.1.1 Document enrolments (by FLE and headcounts) for the most recent 5-year period, \nincluding the current academic year if available. \nMajor in Spanish \nCombined Honors in Spanish: currently no enrolments \n1.1.2 Indicate when admissions into program/specialization will be or were closed. \nSubject to government approval, the proposed major in Modern Languages and Cultural Studies \nwill be available for students in Fall 2019. At that point, there will be no further admission to the \nmajor in Spanish or Combined Honors in Spanish. Active students who entered the major in \nSpanish or Combined Honors in Spanish prior to September 2019 will be taught out and able to \nfinish their studies in the current program and receive their Bachelor of Arts. They would be \nasked to complete all program requirements by April 30, 2024 and the last degree with a major in \nSpanish or Combined Honors in Spanish will be granted at Spring Convocation 2024. If any \nactive students in the initial stages of the major in Spanish or Combined Honors in Spanish \nwould like to switch to the new major in Modern Languages and Cultural Studies, they may opt \nto do so and follow the requirements of the new major.  \nEnrolment 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 \nTotal head count 24 21 21 24 20 \n Full-Time Year 1 6 5 3 3 3 \n Full-Time Year 2 8 6 6 6 4 \n Full-Time Year 3 1 6 5 7 3 \n Full-Time Year 4 9 4 7 8 10 \nTotal FLE 19.1 15.3 18.6 21.2 17.7 \n FLE Year 1 5 2.6 1.9 1.4 1.8 \n FLE Year 2 5.6 5 5.3 4.9 3.6 \n FLE Year 3 1.5 4.1 4.3 6.4 3.7 \n FLE Year 4 7 3.6 7.1 8.5 8.6 \n3 \n1.1.3  Explain how the proposed end date of the suspension was determined.  \nThe proposed end date is dependent on the approval of the MLCS major. We hope that the \nsuspension of the current majors will be implemented by July 1, 2019 with a proposed end date \n(dependent on government approvals) of June 30, 2024. This allows students who enrolled in the \nmajor in Spanish and Combined Honors in Spanish before Sept. 2019 to finish their degree. At \nthe end date of the suspension, the major in Spanish and Combined Honors in Spanish will be \nterminated. \n1.1.4 Provide specific information about which internal governance body approved the \nsuspension, and provide date of approval. (Attach copy of minutes or motions.) \nOn May 25, 2017 Arts Faculty Council (AFC) approved the proposed MLCS major and the \nsuspensions of all current majors (item 13.1, see attached minutes).  \n1.2 Check the applicable box to specify the longer-term plan. \n☑  To terminate the program.  \n☐  To reactivate the program.  \nSECTION 2: ACCESS \n2.1 Identify potential student access considerations and risks for Campus Alberta that the \nsuspension of this program could pose (include both (a) information about related programs \navailable to prospective students internally at your institution; and (b) externally at other \nAlberta institutions). \nStudents will be able to focus on Spanish in the new major in Modern Languages and Cultural \nStudies and take the same courses that were available to them as part of the suspended majors. \nTherefore, it has no implications externally at other Campus Alberta institutions. \n2.1.1 If the program or specialization is unique in the province, describe consultation within \nCampus Alberta to investigate feasibility of program/specialization transfer. \n4 \nConsultation within Campus Alberta occurred as part of the development of the proposal for the \nnew major in MLCS. No consultation regarding the suspension of existing majors was necessary \ndue to the fact that courses in these languages, literatures, and cultures will still be offered within \nthe proposed MLCS major. While the language majors may no longer exist, the institution will \nretain the capacity to offer language acquisition experiences in them through the MLCS major. \nStudents’ transcripts will allow them to show their language competencies.  \n2.2 Describe the consultation process that occurred with students at your institution regarding \nthis programming change. \nStudent feedback was solicited in various ways. In February and November 2016, respectively, \nthe proposed new major in Modern Languages and Cultural Studies was presented to a total of \n882 (362 and 520) students during class visits (858 students enrolled in 29 different classes, \nselected to represent a cross-section of all of our programs) and at a special town hall meeting \nheld on February 25, 2016 for all students majoring in our various programs at the time (24 \nstudents attended). In both settings, students were given a presentation of the proposed changes, \nand were offered the opportunity to ask questions and raise concerns. Students’ comments at the \ntown hall meeting were recorded on site. In addition, students in both settings were encouraged \nto complete an online questionnaire about the proposed degree, asking them to comment on what \nthey like about the new MLCS major, and how it could be improved. We also asked them to rate \ntheir agreement with the following statement on a five-point scale: “The new MLCS major, as \nexplained to me, would meet my expectations of a university degree in Modern Languages and \nCultural Studies” (with one being “strongly disagree” and five indicating “strongly agree”). We \nreceived a total of 235 responses to the online questionnaire (26.64% response rate). With \nrespect to the statement above, it received a 3.94 (out of 5) average rating, indicating a high level \nof support for the proposed major in MLCS. \nQualitative comments were overwhelmingly positive, emphasizing the focus on study abroad and \nexperiential learning, the opportunity to combine several languages or to take the cross-cultural \nroute, and the new major’s increased flexibility and simplification of requirements. Students also \nperceived the new capstone course as a valuable asset when applying for graduate studies. \nMoreover, they applauded the new major for buoying the smaller language areas, encouraging \nincreased interconnectedness in MLCS, and creating a community within the department rather \nthan just within certain disciplines. \n2.3 Describe your institution’s plans to assist active students, if any remain, in completing \ngraduation requirements during the suspension period, including information about formal \ncommunication and student advising plans.  \nActive students in the major in Spanish and Combined Honors in Spanish will be able to finish \ntheir studies and receive their Bachelor of Arts. Assuming the proposed major in Modern \n5 \nLanguages and Cultural Studies goes into effect in September 2019, there will be no further \nadmission to the major in Spanish and Combined Honors in Spanish effective the 2019 academic \nyear. Subject to government approvals of the proposed MLCS and these suspensions, students \nwho entered the Spanish program prior to September 2019 would then be asked to complete all \nprogram requirements by April 30, 2024 and the last degree with a major in Spanish or \nCombined Honors in Spanish will be granted at Spring Convocation 2024. If any active students \nin the initial stages of their Spanish studies would like to switch to the new major in Modern \nLanguages and Cultural Studies, they may opt to do so and follow the requirements of the new \nmajor.  \n2.4 Describe your institution’s plans to accommodate stop-out students, if any have been \nidentified, including information about formal communication plans. \nStop-out students who have started a major in Spanish or Combined Honors in Spanish prior to \nSeptember 2019 and return to finish their degree after 2019 may opt to switch to the new major \nin Modern Languages and Cultural Studies and follow the requirements of the new major. \nSECTION 3: IMPACT  \n3.1 Identify which stakeholder groups were consulted: \n☑  Faculty \n☐  Regulatory and other Accreditation \nBodies \n☐  Employers and Professional \nAssociations  \n☐  Advisory Committee(s) \n☑  Other (identify below) \nOther:  \n- Division of German, Russian, Arabic Languages and Muslim Cultures (School of \nLanguages, Linguistics, Literatures and Cultures), University of Calgary \n- Department of Modern Languages, University of Lethbridge \n- Department of East Asian Studies, University of Alberta \n- Community Service-Learning, Faculty of Arts, University of Alberta \n- University of Alberta International, University of Alberta \n- OASIS (Organization of Arts Students and Interdisciplinary Studies), University of \nAlberta \n- Augustana Campus, University of Alberta \n6 \n- Art Gallery of Alberta \n3.1.1 Describe the consultation process conducted with these stakeholders and summarize the \nfeedback received. \nFaculty consultations: \nFollowing the suspension of ten MLCS majors by the Dean of the Faculty of Arts in August \n2013 due to persistently low enrollments, the MLCS curriculum committee prepared a proposal \nfor a new major in Modern Languages and Cultural Studies.

Like the IB Diploma program, AP Capstone is intended to prepare \nhigh achieving students for University.  In 2016, a request from High School AP counsellors \nin Alberta was brought forward to the University of Alberta to review the program for transfer \ncredit potential.  After a full review by the Faculties of Arts and Science and consultation with \nthe Faculty of Engineering, it was deemed acceptable to offer credit in a 100-level open \nelective worth 3 units of course weight. \nThe AP Capstone Diploma program consists of three components: \n1. Writing four AP final subject exams \n2. Completing the AP Seminar \n3. Completing a research project with a 4000 word paper and oral defence \nCompletion of the three components marked as high (graded a 3 on a 5 scale), is mandatory \nfor the awarding of the diploma.   \nAs the University of Alberta has already assessed the rigor and outcomes of the 4 AP \nsubject exams, it was not necessary to review them again.  Agreements for AP subject \nexams have been in place for many years and are reviewed annually when curriculum \nchanges are provided to us from the College Board, changes are presented to ASC under \nseparate cover. The review process for this proposal was to assess the rigor and outcomes \nof the seminar and research project, and the scoring rubric used.  The full course outline for \nthe research project and seminar was provided to faculties, as well as grading guidelines \nwith examples of work scored high, medium, and low. \nThe College Board’s description of the research project: \nAP Research, the second course in the AP Capstone experience, allows students to deeply \nexplore an academic topic, problem, issue, or idea of individual interest. Students design, \nplan, and implement a year long investigation to address a research question. Through this \ninquiry, they further the skills they acquired in the AP Seminar course by learning research \nmethodology, employing ethical research practices, and accessing, analyzing, and \nsynthesizing information. Students reflect on their skill development, document their \nprocesses, and curate \nthe artifacts of their scholarly work through a process and reflection portfolio. The course \nculminates in an academic paper of 4,000—5,000 words (accompanied by a performance, \nexhibit, or product where applicable) and a presentation with an oral defense. \nFull course

\nhttps://apcentral.collegeboard.org/courses/ap-seminar?course=ap-seminar \nThe decision by faculties to support this proposal is supported by the quality of the \ncurriculum offered by the College Board and the success of AP students at the University of \nAlberta.
