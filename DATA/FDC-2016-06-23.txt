The contractual agreement is based on a Modified Design Build \nagreement that establishes the collaborative framework for the Design \nBuild process. This framework requires that the University of Alberta, \nGraham Construction, the Mechanical and Electrical Contractors, the \nArchitectural, Landscape, Mechanical, Electrical, Structural and Civil \nConsultants participate in the design process in a highly collaborative, \nfully integrated environment.\nThis report documents the Design Development Phase of the project \nand it includes further detail and design of the Architectural, Structural, \nMechanical, Electrical, Landscape and Civil schematic design parameters \nas well as an updated outline of the sustainable design principles and \nBuilding Code summary. \nProject Goals\nThe project goals as stated by the University of Alberta for this project \nare as follows:\n• Increase purpose built student residences to accommodate up to \n25% of full-time students at the University of Alberta.\n• Support student recruitment, retention and achievement.\n• Enhance community building, student life and campus experience.\n• Smart growth campus development that supports a safe, sustainable \nand healthy community.\n• Integrate planned neighbourhood with amenities.\nBest Practices\nThe University of Alberta referenced the “Best Practices” identified in the \nTall Building Guidelines (City of Toronto) in developing design guidelines \nfor this project. These guidelines were carefully reviewed and addressed \nduring the schematic design phase of this project and are documented \nin the Design Process section of this report.\nProject Background\nThe Lister Complex is comprised of four individual residential \ncommunities arranged around a central service core and is one of the \nUniversity of Alberta’s primary on-campus residence providers. The \nLister Complex provides accommodations for students attending the \nUniversity, as well as amenities such as food services, recreation and \nsocial opportunities, study spaces, teaching spaces, resident community \nareas and University staff service offices. \nThe atmosphere, amenities and opportunities that the Lister Complex \noffers to the students in their early years on campus, will set the stage \nfor their success in each student’s academic careers and well beyond \nthe University boundaries once they complete their education. \nIn response to these increasing demands for more and better \naccommodations on Campus, the University has identified the Lister \nComplex as a prime candidate for a new residential facility, building on \nthe strong foundation created by the existing Lister Community. \nMethodology\nThe University of Alberta and the Design Build team have met in the “Big \nRoom” or meeting/work space over the course of 16 consecutive weeks \nto review the design evolution and collaborated together to arrive at the \ndesign proposal contained in this report. \nThe Big Room is a large space located on the University of Alberta \ncampus that is spacious enough to accommodate the complete team for \nmeetings and on-going coordination work, including mock-up reviews. \nScale mock-ups of the two typical rooms with furniture were set up and \nreviewed by the team as part of the design process.\nBig Room sessions took place over the course of a day, divided into \na morning architectural design and program review session and \nan afternoon session to coordinate the engineering disciplines in \nconsultation with the University of Alberta Project and Facilities \nManagement teams. These sessions included a facilitator that provided \nsupport to the team to meet the milestones and deliverables established \nat the outset of the project.\nLister 5 Student Residence Project Must Haves\nAt the first meeting, the University of Alberta presented a list of “must \nhaves” or non-negotiable requirements for the project which established \nthe priorities for the design process as follows:\n• Students Want to Stay in Residence (Gravity System) \n• Support Student Wellness \n• “Home Like” > Safe\n• Connectivity to Neighbourhood/Campus \n• Transform Lister Complex \n• Maximum Utilization Year Round (Not Just Beds, Conferences)\n• Knowable Community \n• Recruitment Tool \n• Support Community Development and Belonging (Roommate > Hall \n> Building > Neighbourhood) \n• Optimizes Landscape Opportunities (Civic/Potential Future)\n• Facilitate Engagement and Academic Success \n• Reflect University Values/Academic Vision \n• Has to be Intentional (Function as Intended) \n• Building That Completes The Neighbourhood But Has Unique Place \nIn Our Inventory \n• Sense of Tradition (Cohort Persistence) \n• RA Ratio / Co RA (1:28 RA Single) \n• Sustainable (Energy) Tech Connectivity (Cable/Wireless)\n• “Huddle” Room \n• Creates a “Buzz” \nEX\nEC\nU\nTI\nV\nE \nSU\nM\nM\nA\nR\nY\nLister 5\nDesign Development Report\n6\nProgram Overview\nThe Lister 5 Project RFP documents released in December of 2015, \nidentified the need for a residence tower to accommodate 520 student \nbeds. Based on the information presented in the RFP and the identified \nbudget, it was ascertained by the Design Build Team that construction of \na facility of approximately 9,031 m2 (97,200 sq. ft. ) could be achievable. \nIn February 2016, The University of Alberta provided a detailed program \nsummary which formed the basis for the schematic design phase. The \narea allocation identified in this enhanced program varied from the \nassumptions made based on the RFP document. This program summary \nidentified a gross floor area of 12,296 m2 (132,358 sq. ft.) and a total \nbed count of 490 beds. The five areas identified in the February 2016 \nprogram document included Staff & Faculty living apartments, Student \nliving units, Floor community areas, Residence Hall Community and \nsupport spaces. \nThe program was reviewed, discussed and modified during the Big \nRoom sessions during the months of February through April. Between \nthe release of the program on February 19th, 2016 and the first program \nreconciliation, numerous iterations, arrangements and program \nconfigurations were presented for feedback and discussion. These \ninterim steps and design concepts are captured in the Design Concepts \nsection in this report. \nIn March 2016, the Graham Design Build Team presented a program and \nbudget that was significantly larger than the initial RFP document and \nslightly above the February 19, 2016 program statement. The Schematic \nDesign concept had grown to 12,528 m2 (134,850 sq. ft.). \nIn early April 2016, the project team met to identify potential cost savings \nand reduction strategies to align the current design with the initial \nprogram and the budget. A series of scope reviews were performed to \nassess potential area reductions, while still maintaining the vision and \nproject objectives. \nThe reduction in room size, combined with a revised student bed count \nof 460 beds, and a minor reduction in the amenity areas allowed the \nbuilding to shrink by 1,768 m2 (17,680 sq. ft.), arriving to a total area \n10,200 m2 (109,210 sq. ft.). A chart of reconciliation is included to \nrecord the progression of the Program from the RFP Stage to the current \nconditions. The drawings included in this report represent the revised \nprogram and reconciled area agreed to by the University of Alberta.\nDesign Deliverables and Process\nThe Design Build team and the University of Alberta refined and clarified \nthe following objectives for the project after detailed discussions around \nproject vision, desired outcomes and a clear understanding of the “must \nhaves”:\n• Create a new home for a population of 460 students.  \n• Create a safe, supportive community that is successfully integrated \nto the existing Lister Complex.  \n• Enhance the Lister Complex and be mindful of the neighbouring \ncommunity. \n• Reinforce engagement and create opportunities to promote social \ninteraction between faculty and students. \n• Create a living and learning center with spaces that support \ncommunity.\n• Design a building that is supportive of social sustainability to create \nan equitable, inclusive and resilient community.  \n• Create horizontal as well as vertical integration.  \n• Provide infrastructure that can also support conferences.  \nDuring the course of the Schematic Design process, the Design Team \ngenerated multiple design options that were presented on a weekly basis \nto the University of Alberta for discussion and validation. Subsequent \nto the submission of the Schematic Design Report, the Design Team \ncontinued it's development of the preferred design concept and has \nelaborated in more detail the floor plans, site layout, the exterior and \ninterior aesthetics and the building systems.\nSite and Context\nThe parcel of land allocated for the Lister 5 facility has been identified \nas the tract of land and parking area located south of the existing Lister \ncomplex, Henday and Mackenzie towers. This area currently supports \nstudent parking for the Lister Centre and has an outdoor hockey rink. \nThe remainder of the site is open park space with asphalt trails and \npathways linking the Henday and Mackenzie Halls to the rest of the \ncampus circulation routes. \nThe existing site has a grade difference from high to low of approximately \n2m (6 – 7 ft.). The design team has looked at this grade difference as an \nopportunity to use the grade difference and step the ground floor of \nthe building and provide areas that would benefit from increased ceiling \nheight in locations at the lowest grade elevation of the site. \nMore detailed investigations have established the building main floor \nelevation in relationship to the adjacent site constraints.  The building \nhas been placed to maximize the efficiency of the site development \nwhile still maintaining enclosed and conditioned access to Mackenzie \nHall.\nBuilding Design\nThe design process for Lister 5 began with a thorough analysis of \nthe existing site adjacencies and servicing conditions in order to \nappropriately place the building on site to both enrich the existing Lister \ncomplex and positively integrate with the residential community to \nthe west. Between February and March various massing options were \nexplored ranging between a tall point towers to a long, low forms. After \nthese initial proposals it was collectively agreed that a lower building \nmass offered better solar exposure and views while maintaining more \nprivacy between the existing Lister Towers. The enlarged site footprint \nand L-shaped massing also presented the opportunity to create new \ncourtyard spaces that act to enrich the existing framework of open \ninterstitial spaces.\nConcurrent to the explorations around building massing, the interior \nplanning strategy of the residence was being explored by the design \nteam and Big Room group. Both double and single loaded residential \nplans were explored within an extensive analysis of the appropriate \nadjacencies between residential, amenity and support spaces. Further \nto this, a detailed study of room size, layout, fenestration and exposure \ntook place over the course of several weeks.

On the exterior, these \nintersections manifest themselves as extensively glazed areas wrapped in a \nwarm, natural cladding that allow for transparency right through the floor \nplate and bring natural light deep into the residence community. These \nlarger glazed areas in combination with the corridors, which terminate at \nthe envelope in full height windows to break down the massing into a series \nof smaller facades and daylight corridor axis.\nIn the public wing of the ground floor transparency is further emphasized \nto maximize natural lighting, provide visual connections between the \nstreet and courtyard and to clearly identify these amenity and social \nspaces at pedestrian level. The west wing of the ground floor is intended \nto be the social centre of Lister 5 connecting the new residence to the \nbroader Lister complex. In particular, the living room or “huddle room” is \nthe place where quality amenity spaces such as the communal kitchen, \nlounge and games room allow students to feel at home and foster a \nsense of community and interaction between student and faculty. \nThis “at home” feel is further accentuated through the use of natural \nmaterials in the ceiling and walls as well as careful placement of artwork \nand colour. \nFacility, Operations and Maintenance\nThe Design Development Phase of the project has provided the team \nthe opportunity to review the proposed building systems in more detail. \nThe Stakeholders from the University have been consulted throughout \nthe process as the detailed design of the building systems has evolved \nand their comments and recommendations have been captured to date \nin the information provided here in. The proposed building systems are \ndescribed in more detail later on in the report.\nSchedule \nThe design development process is the final chapter in the Phase \none deliverable of the project. Design Development is a continuation \nof exploration starting from the submission of the Schematic design \nreport on May 10th and terminating with the submission of this Design \nDevelopment Report. To date the Phase 1 timeline has presented itself \non the following schedule: \n• First Big Room Meeting:  February 10, 2016 \n• First Open House:  February 25, 2016 \n• Schematic Design Phase:  February 10 - May 10, 2016 \n• Student Focus Group Session:  March 14, 2016 \n• Submission of Schematic Design Report:  May 10, 2016 \n• Second Public Open House:  May 17, 2016 \n• Design Development Phase:  May 11 - June 9, 2016 \n• Submission of Design Development Report:  June 9, 2016\nThe U of A team engaged the community in a Public open house forum \nto gather valuable feedback from the community at large. The Open \nHouse was conducted on February 25, 2016 and was open to the \npublic for comment. The Open House identified the Lister 5 project as \na component in the North Campus Long Range Plan, presenting the \nsite selection process and listing the Best Practices for Concept Design.  \nThe comments and feedback received from this event, was tabulated, \ndocumented and passed on to the design team as a reference to inform \ndecisions that will shape the schematic design.\nWith the transition into the Design Development Phase of this project, \nadditional community consultation was scheduled. On May 17th, the \nUniversity presented the Lister 5 schematic design concept to the \nCommunity at the second of two open houses. The Big Room meetings \ncontinued to provide valuable dialogue and direction to the design \nteam, which is captured in the design presentation in this report.\nThe feedback and comments from the schematic design report \nsubmission & the public open houses have been reviewed at incorporated \ninto the design development.\nCost Planning \nGraham Construction has prepared cost reports during the design \ndevelopment process that have been revised with the evolution of the \ndesign concepts to reflect the current design described in this report. \nThe cost reports were reviewed with the University on numerous \noccasions both in and outside of the Big Room meetings.  At all times \nthe University has challenged the design team to deliver the required \nprogram objectives while striving to maintain economical solutions. \nNext Steps \nThe project team will move from the Phase One objectives and the \ndevelopment of the design concept, into the manifestations of the \ndesign concept into contract documents. These contract documents will \nform the story board for the construction of the facility and will provide \nthe detailed information for the Contractor to produce the design \nconcept in the built environment. Throughout Phase 2 of the project the \ndesign team will continue to consult and review the design parameters \nand schedule with the University in the effort to maintain the delivery of \nthe project on time, on budget and meeting program objectives.\nEX\nEC\nU\nTI\nV\nE \nSU\nM\nM\nA\nR\nY\nLister 5\nDesign Development Report\n8\n1.0 INTRODUCTION\n1.\n0 \nIN\nTR\nO\nD\nU\nC\nTI\nO\nN\n1.\n0 \nIN\nTR\nO\nD\nU\nC\nTI\nO\nN\nLister 5\nDesign Development Report\n9\nINTRODUCTION\nProject Background\nThe Lister Complex is one of the University of Alberta’s primary on-campus \nresidence providers. This facility supplies residence accommodations \nfor students attending the University, as well as amenities such as food \nservices, recreation and social opportunities, study spaces, teaching \nspaces, resident community areas and University staff service offices.\nThe facility is comprised of four individual residential communities \narranged around a central service core, housing a total of approximately \n1,800 students.  The first components of the Lister Complex were \nconstructed in 1964 and are comprised of the Henday Tower, Mackenzie \nTower and Kelsey Hall, all serviced by the central Lister food service \ncomplex. In 2003, Schaffer Hall was constructed to expand the residence \ncomplex capacity to meet the growing need for student housing on \ncampus.  \nEach of the residence buildings is linked to the service core through \nabove grade exterior walkways and more importantly, an underground \npedestrian tunnel system. This tunnel system is the predominant path \nof travel for the typical student, as it affords shelter and protection to \nthe students as they travel from their residence to classes on Campus. \nThis tunnel system is a luxury that is well used allowing students to \ntransverse Lister Complex in the comfort of shorts and flip flops even on \nthe coldest of winter days. \nEach community has its own identity, even though three of the four \nresidences are similar in construction and appearance.  It is in this \nidentity that students will work together to create a new community \neach and every school year, welcoming new and returning students, and \nproviding the safety and security that students will miss when leaving \ntheir homes in other towns, cities, provinces and countries. The University \nunderstands that the atmosphere, amenities and opportunities that the \nLister Complex offers to the students in their early years on campus, \nwill set the stage for their success in each student’s academic careers \nand well beyond the University boundaries once they complete their \neducation. \nThe demand for on-campus accommodations is steadily increasing \nand is becoming an important variable for students when making their \ndecisions to select which University to attend.  In response to these \nincreasing demands for more and better accommodations on Campus, \nthe University has identified the Lister Complex as a prime candidate for \na new residential facility, building on the strong foundation created by \nthe existing Lister communities. In preparation for the issuance of the \nRFP for this project, the University team went abroad and visited other \nUniversity campus residence facilities to gather an understanding and \nview on current trends and best practices in some of the most current \nand/or successful residence models in operation today. \nLister 5 will add significant capacity to the complex, allowing the \nUniversity to support it’s mandate of guaranteeing housing for any first \nyear student accepted by the University.  The social and amenity spaces \nhave been designed to enhance the first year experience program which \nis based upon intentional learning outcomes for the first year student \ndemographic. \nIn late 2015, the University issued an RFP for Design-Build Services to \nwork with the University and develop the next residence on the Lister \nComplex site. In February of 2016, the Graham Design-Build team \nwas awarded the opportunity to join the University in expanding the \nresidential offerings on Campus with the Lister 5 Project. \nThe information herein expands the rationale and progressive \nelaboration of the design development process Issuance of this report, \nrepresents detailed insight into the additional hours of discussion, \ncollaboration, consultation and documentation of the design process.\nDesired Outcomes\nThe purpose of the design development process and report is to provide \na more detailed response and solution to the following:\n• Affirm and document the agreed scope of work.\n• Validate and expand upon the functional program as presented by \nthe U of A.\n• A framework for a realistic and founded Schematic Design cost \nopinion.\n• A foundation for decisions to move forward in a direction that is \nclear and educated into the next phases of the project. \n• Document decisions made during the detailed Design process and \nillustrate the rationale behind these decisions.1.\n0 \nIN\nTR\nO\nD\nU\nC\nTI\nO\nN\n1.\n0 \nIN\nTR\nO\nD\nU\nC\nTI\nO\nN\nLister 5\nDesign Development Report\n10\nMethodology\nIn order to engage all stakeholders from the user, owner, contractor and \ndesign teams, meetings were held on a weekly basis. These “Big Room” \nmeetings were held with the purpose of allowing a wide cross section \nof input from all interested parties, simultaneously vetting concepts, \nideas and visions amongst all team members and seeking discussion and \nvalidation at the same time.  This process allowed the team to move \nquickly through concepts and schematic design ideas, while at the same \ntime analyzing cost, function, form and operations. These debates, \nconversations and sharing of ideas, strengthened each stakeholder’s \n“vision” for the project and provided the team with a unified direction \nto proceed forward in the design process.  Through this process, the \nproject team identified the following list of “non-negotiable” items.  \nThis list was the basis to test the design decisions against and validate \nwhether or not we are meeting the project team goals:\nU of A LISTER 5 RESIDENCE “MUST HAVES”\n1. Students Want to Stay in Residence (Gravity System) \n2. Support Student Wellness \n3. “Home Like” > Safe \n4. Connectivity to Neighbourhood / Campus \n5. Transform Lister Complex \n6. Maximum Utilization Year Round (Not Just Beds, Conferences) \n7. Knowable Community \n8. Recruitment Tool \n9. Support Community Development and Belonging (Roommate > Hall \n> Building > Neighbourhood) \n10. Optimizes Landscape Opportunities (Civic / Potential Future) \n11. Facilitate Engagement and Academic Success\n12. Reflect University Values / Academic Vision\n13. Has to be Intentional (Function as Intended)\n14.

Tech Connectivity (Cable / Wireless)\n19. “Huddle” Room\n20. Creates a “Buzz”\nThe process of \"Big Room\" meetings was maintained throughout the \nDesign Development Phase and further refined the design of Lister \n5. As the design evolved and progressed, the team focused on more \nspecific details of each space, the aesthetics of the exterior and interior, \nthe integration of the building into the campus at large and the specific \nsystems that will service the facility.\n1.\n0 \nIN\nTR\nO\nD\nU\nC\nTI\nO\nN\n1.\n0 \nIN\nTR\nO\nD\nU\nC\nTI\nO\nN\nLister 5\nDesign Development Report\n11\nDesign Build Team:\n• Andrew Hill, Graham\n• Art Winslow, Graham\n• Doug Hager, Graham\n• Joe Leonard, Graham\n• Phil Bloomfield, Graham\n• Trevor Ostapiw, Graham\n• Ana Maria Llanos, Diamond Schmitt Architects\n• Chris Wanless, Diamond Schmitt Architects \n• Don Schmitt, Diamond Schmitt Architects\n• Shaun Visser, BR2 Architecture\n• Lindsay Mouser, Protostatix\n• Scott Koehn, Arrow Engineering\n• Glen Tichkowsky, Arrow Engineering\n• Maz Kitabwalla, Arrow Engineering\n• Blaine McMurdo, Jetco Mechanical\n• Rick Klein, Jetco Mechanical\n• Derek Ciezki, SMP\n• Henry Chu, SMP\n• Morley Harke, Canem\n• Daniel Jackson, EDA Collaborative\n• Ted Muller, EDA Collaborative\nUniversity of Alberta Team:\n• Navneet Khinda, Students Union President, University of Alberta \n• Evan Braun, Student, University of Alberta\n• Andrew Choate, Student, University of Alberta\n• Evan MacDonald, Student, University of Alberta\n• Stephen Raitz, Student, University of Alberta\n• Taylor Wright, Student, University of Alberta\n• Sarah Wolgemuth, Assistant Dean of Students, Residence Life, \nUniversity of Alberta\n• Laura Huxley, Residence Area Coordinator, Residence Services, \nUniversity of Alberta\n• Alana Turner, Residence Coordinator, Residence Services,   \nUniversity of Alberta\n• Dolores March, Director, Hospitality Services, University of Alberta\n• Doug Dawson, Associate Vice President, Ancillary Services, \nUniversity of Alberta\n• Geoff Rode, Director of Operations, Ancillary Services, University of \nAlberta\n• Todd Werre, Director, Project Management Office,  \nUniversity of Alberta\n• Terry Sperling, Associate Director, Residence Operations,  \nUniversity of Alberta\n• Asia Szkudlarek, Project Cost Analyst, Project Management Office, \nUniversity of Alberta\n• Ben Louie, Director, University Architect, Office of the University \nArchitect\n• Kelly Hopkin, Manager, Campus Architecture, Office of the   \nUniversity Architect\n• Keith Hollands, Associate Director, Design & Technical Services, \nUniversity of Alberta\n• Buddy Hall, Principal, Architecture Planning, HEWV\n• Graeme Alston, Independent Cost Consultant,   \nAcumen Cost Consulting\nBreakout sessions and meetings continued to be scheduled to deal with \nmore specific functions, systems and concepts.

It was the project team's goal \nto maintain efficiency and value in the program while striving to keep \nthe costs within project objectives. This focus on unbalancing program \nneeds against project cost generated options and opportunities to \nmassage the building design to achieve these goals.\nProgram Overview and Reconciliation\nThe Lister 5 Project RFP documents released in December of 2015, \nidentified the need for a residence tower to accommodate 520 student \nbeds.  Based on that information the Graham Design-Build team \nperformed a preliminary program test to see how this program might \nalign with the budget presented.  Based on  information presented \nin the RFP, the desired bed count and the budget, it was ascertained \nthat construction of a facility of approximately 9,031 m2  (97,200 sq. \nft.) could be achievable.  With the award of the project to the Graham \nDesign Build team, the University of Alberta provided a more detailed \nand comprehensive program document Identifying five major program \nareas.  \nThe five areas identified in the February 2016 program document \nincluded Staff & Faculty Living Apartments, Student Living Units, Floor \nCommunity Areas, Residence Hall Community and Support spaces. The \narea allocation identified in this program was significantly different from \nthe assumptions made based on the RFP document by the Design Build \nteam and had identified a gross floor area for the facility of 12, 296 m2 \n(132,358 sq. ft.) and the identified student capacity reduced to 490 \nstudents. The detailed program document allowed the design team to \nbegin the process of putting the program on paper and coming up with \nplans that tested the program and its relationships to all the elements. \nThe program areas were divided up with the following requirements.\nStaff & Faculty Living Units\nIncluded in this program area are the live in residential units that will \nhouse the Residence Coordinator and one faculty apartment.  These \nunits will provide the accommodations for those professionals that \nwill be required to provide student services while living on campus in \nthe residence community. These units are akin to a 90 m2 (990 sq. ft.) \nbedroom apartment/condo environment.\nStudent Living Units\nThe student living area component of the program provides the student \naccommodation spaces. In this program area the February program \nidentified 230 double room beds, 20 single room RA beds and 10 \naccessible room units, for a total of 490 students.\nFloor Community\nThe Floor Community program provides the amenity and student \nservice spaces to support the Student living units.  In this program \narea, amenities such as study rooms, lounges/kitchenettes, common \nlounges and washroom facilities are provided. The residence building \nwas divided into 14 smaller communities, each of these communities \nwas programmed and intended to provide an environment that is more \npersonal and allows the student to engage with the other residents \nof their community on a more personal level, giving the student the \nopportunity to gain that sense of belonging to a more intimate personal \ntype setting. Each of these communities is to be served by its own study \nspace, lounge/kitchenette and washroom facilities.\nResidence Hall Community\nThis program area responds directly to the overall Lister 5 residence \ncommunity.  The program functions listed under this heading are \nprovided to serve the students living in Lister 5 and potentially other \nstudents in the Lister Hall complex depending on the function and \nlocation. The services that would support the Lister 5 facility include; \nstudy rooms, lobby/living room, lounge, kitchen, laundry, fitness centre, \nmulti-purpose room, classrooms, media/games room and office spaces \nfor the RA and Association use.  The classroom, fitness, games room and \nmulti-purpose room are program spaces that are envisioned to be used \nby more than just the Lister 5 residents and could provide additional \namenity opportunities for all the students in the Lister Complex.\nSupport Spaces\nThe final program area listed in the February program, deals with the \nprogram spaces that are required to provide a supporting role to all of the \nother functions listed in the program document. These spaces include \nthe mechanical and electrical rooms, bike storage, building storage, \ntrash and recycle, custodial services and circulation and connection to \nthe existing Lister complex. All of these spaces are essential to providing \na high quality residential experience for the student living in the Lister \n5 facility.\nThroughout the design process the program areas were consulted and \ntested to make sure that all the University needs and requirements \nwere being captured and maintained.  However the as the design \nprocess matured the program areas slowly increased or were added \nto.  Between the release of the initial program on February 19th and \nthe first program reconciliation, numerous iterations, arrangements and \nprogram configurations were presented to the Big Room for feedback \nand discussion.  These interim steps and design concepts are captured \nin the Design Concepts section in this report. In March 2016, the \nGraham Design Build Team presented a program and budget that was \nsignificantly larger than the initial RFP document and slightly above the \nFebruary program statement. The schematic design concept had grown \nto 12,528 m2 (134,850 sq. ft.). While all of the program functions and \nareas were accounted for in this design solution, it was found that there \nwas a need to drive the project back towards the original program areas \nwhile maintaining as much of the valuable discussions and feedback \nreceived from the Client during the schematic design process.  \nIn early April, the project team met to identify potential cost savings \nand reduction strategies to align the current design with the initial \nprogram. From this meeting a series of scope reviews were performed \nto determine where area could be saved on the project, while \nstill maintaining the vision and dedication to providing a quality \nenvironment and experience for the student residents.  The biggest and \nmost exhaustive review completed in this phase was the review of the \nindividual room unit size.  The project team laid out the student living \nunit in full scale with furniture place holders to physically determine the \nbest and most efficient size and arrangement for the dorm room. The \nagreements and decisions made to reduce the room size manifested \nitself in the reduction of area from the initial program area of 21.3 m2 \n(230 sq. ft.) to 14 m2 (182 sq. ft.) per room.  This reduction in room size, \ncombined with a revisited room / student bed count of 460 students, \nas well as slightly reduce amenity areas allowed the building to shrink \nby 1,768 m2 (17,680 sq. ft.), for a total of 10,200 m2 (109,210 sq.ft.). As \nof this report, the current design is maintaining the building area to the \ntolerance reserved to meet the current budget. The average floor area \nillustrated in the DD report is 10,264m2.\nA chart of reconciliation is included to record the progression of the \nprogram from the RFP Stage to the current conditions as reflected in \nthis Design Development Report.\n2.\n0 \nA\nR\nC\nH\nIT\nEC\nTU\nR\nA\nL\nLister 5\nDesign Development Report\n16\nPROGRAM ANALYSIS CHART\n2.\n0 \nA\nR\nC\nH\nIT\nEC\nTU\nR\nA\nL\n2.\n0 \nA\nR\nC\nH\nIT\nEC\nTU\nR\nA\nL\nLister 5\nDesign Development Report\n17\nIncorporating Artwork in the Building \nDuring the Design Development Phase, the University requested the \ndesign team to explore opportunities to provide areas for display of art. \nReview and discussion on potential locations identified the need for \nthese opportunities to be distributed throughout the facility and beyond \nthe main level. For the main level the team identified three locations for \npotential art display, two inside and one outside. The indoor locations \nare focused on having one in the living room area and one on the face \nof the north stair. The exterior art opportunity was set to be placed in \nthe elbow of the building allowing the users of the interior social spaces \nto experience a sculptural element through the glazing. This exterior \nsculpture element could also be experienced directly from the exterior \nas well. It was agreed that three locations on each resident floor would \nbe acceptable, one location in each of the two communities on the floor \nand one location that was immediately visible to the residents as they \nexit the elevator to their floor.\n2.\n0 \nA\nR\nC\nH\nIT\nEC\nTU\nR\nA\nL\n2.\n0 \nA\nR\nC\nH\nIT\nEC\nTU\nR\nA\nL\nLister 5\nDesign Development Report\n18\nThe Design Development Phase was founded on the schematic design \nconcept floor plans as submitted in the Schematic Design Report. \nFurther development of these schematic design floor plans and site \ndevelopment plans progressed the design into the detailed design \ndocuments as found in this report. The evolution of the design from the \nSchematic Design Phase to the completion of this Design Development \nReport is captured in the timeline and images as presented below. \nSubsequent to that, the entire design evolution leading up to the Design \nDevelopment Phase has been documented and presented later in this \nsection for information.\nDESIGN EVOLUTION  (Pre Design Development Phase)\nThe schematic design floor plans and images that are represented in \nthis report are the culmination of multiple and unique iterations of \nplans and visual representations of the program. The design process has \ntraveled through the original inception of three distinct floor plans and \nmassing forms presented at the “Big Room” meeting on February 25, \n2016 to what is being presented here in the proposed schematic design \nconcept. \nFebruary 25, 2016 Meeting\nThe first design concept unveiled at the February 25th meeting explored \nthe implications and fit of the building on the site if the new facility was \na comprised of a regular, rectangular floor plan, 10 stories in height and \nsituated in the southwest corner of the site. \nThe second design concept explored the idea of stretching the building \nto make it more linear and efficient using the corridor in a double loaded \nconfiguration.  This concept created a mass that contained the program \nin an overall height of 10 storeys as well. \nThe third concept presented at the meeting pushed the linear theme \nfurther in order to try to reduce the overall height of the building by \nadding more rooms per floor and making the building larger in overall \nfootprint. This concept created a ‘W” shaped building and reduced the \noverall height to 5 storeys. \nThe most prominent comments and discussion at the February 25th \nmeeting centered around the height of the building and its placement \non the site. With these comments and discussion points in hand the \ndesign team went away from the meeting to refine the design concept. \n2.\n0 \nA\nR\nC\nH\nIT\nEC\nTU\nR\nA\nL\n2.\n0 \nA\nR\nC\nH\nIT\nEC\nTU\nR\nA\nL\nLister 5\nDesign Development Report\n19\nMarch 4, 2016 Meeting \nOn March 4, 2016 the Design team came back to the Project team \nwith three new designs that explored the options available with site \nplacement and shape versus building height. Concept 1 as presented, \nexplored a traditional “L” shaped building with all of the program space \ncontained in a 6 storey envelope. This mass was placed to the southeast \ncorner of the site. \nThe second building concept modified the Concept 1 plan by creating \ntwo smaller “L” shaped masses joined to create a single floor plan. This \nconcept used a combination of 5 and 6 storeys, however this design \nused more of the site due to its longer footprint.  \nConcept 3 was a variation to concept one in the manner that it explored \nthe “L” shaped mass, however this concept articulated the exterior wall \nplanes to create a more irregular shape and manifested the program in \na 6 storey mass. Of these three options the Project team agreed that \nthe development and refinement of Concept 3 was preferred and that \nthe design team should proceed based on this concept as the desired \nmassing and building form.\n2.\n0 \nA\nR\nC\nH\nIT\nEC\nTU\nR\nA\nL\n2.\n0 \nA\nR\nC\nH\nIT\nEC\nTU\nR\nA\nL\nLister 5\nDesign Development Report\n20\nMarch 16, 2016 Meeting\nThe next meeting to review the design refinement occurred on March \n16, 2016. At this meeting the design team presented the refined \nConcept 3 plans and massing imagery and presented in more detail \nhow the footprint would contain the program spaces and where it \nwould nest into the site. The design concept also started to address the \nconnectivity to the rest of the campus with pedestrian circulation to the \nMackenzie Hall tower and the network of pathways found on site.  This \ndesign also introduced the idea of eliminating all main floor resident \nrooms by elevating the east leg of the building, one storey above grade. \nThis decision to move the entire east wing up one level created the \nopportunity of exploring the transparency of the building at grade level \nwith the introduction of a landscaped element where the east wing \nvacated space at the ground level. This shift in the design also spoke \nto the campus development plan by partially dissolving the barrier \ncreated by this building between the Lister Complex and the University \namenities directly south of the complex.  The concept presented, also \nlooked at the possibility of reducing the overall building massing and \nheight by restricting the west wing to 5 storeys and the south wing to a \n6 storey mass. The building was situated as far to the south east of the \nsite in order to respect the residential neighbors to the west.\nMarch 22, 2016 Meeting\nThe Big Room meeting on March 22nd, revealed the design concept \nthat is the predecessor to what is found in the Schematic design report.  \nThis iteration of the design sequence responded to in depth discussions \nheld at the big room where a full size mock up of the resident’s rooms \nwas completed. The mock up revealed that fact that there was room to \ndecrease the size of the suite to reduce the overall area of the building \nand still maintain the usability and comfort that the students will be \nexpecting. The main floor also received some editing and explored \ndifferent placing of the amenities in order to gain the proper adjacencies \nand relationships of these spaces. The courtyard under the south \nwing was also developed to a more detailed state to start to explore \nthe possibilities of what this area might include to support the new \nbuilding and integrate the building into the campus fabric.  The March \n22nd meeting ended with a discussion about affordability and the cost \nof the design relative to the identified budget. It was at this point that \nthe project team identified key areas for review and reduction to try to \nreduce the cost of this option.\n2.\n0 \nA\nR\nC\nH\nIT\nEC\nTU\nR\nA\nL\n2.\n0 \nA\nR\nC\nH\nIT\nEC\nTU\nR\nA\nL\nLister 5\nDesign Development Report\n21\n2.\n0 \nA\nR\nC\nH\nIT\nEC\nTU\nR\nA\nL\nApril 6, 2016 Meeting\nWith the design of the building agreed to in principle, the meeting on \nApril 6, 2016 focused on alignment with the program and budget.  As the \nprevious design submitted on March 22nd, was deemed over budget \nbased on the dollars allocated in the RFP document, the April 6th design \nsubmission highlighted area reductions and main floor changes. The \nDesign team eliminated the ground floor landscape feature and replaced \nthis with student resident rooms.  Although rooms on the main floor \nwere considered less desirable, the trade off allowed the design team to \nreduce the height of the south wing by one level, to 5 storeys. Additional \nreductions to the suite sizes and the wall thickness between the rooms \nallowed the floor plate to be reduced even further. These changes \nalong with other  modifications to the plans realized a significant area \nreduction and thereby reduced the cost of the building substantially. \n2.\n0 \nA\nR\nC\nH\nIT\nEC\nTU\nR\nA\nL\nLister 5\nDesign Development Report\n22\n2.\n0 \nA\nR\nC\nH\nIT\nEC\nTU\nR\nA\nL\nApril 14, 2016 Meeting\nThe planning and space programming at this time has been well \nthought out and the focus on the plan was to fine tune the specific \ndetails at the program spaces. The primary focus of the meeting was to \nbegin a more detailed review and discussion of the exterior aesthetic \nof the building. The design team explores the oppertunity of adding a \n3 dimensional quality to the facade through the use of slopesd planes \nand strip  window patterns.

The main lobby \nand living room/kitchen areas were redesigned to create a better \nseperation of public  and semi private space, there by creating a more \nefficient and organized layout. \nWith the floor plan becoming more refined, additional design though \nwent into the reflected ceiling plans and the interior treatment. \nPreliminary 3 dimensional views were generated in order to provide \nthe team with a better representation of the primary spaces in the \nfacility. \nLISTER HALL - UNIVERSITY OF ALBERTA +\nGROUND FLOOR PLAN - LIVING ROOM\nLISTER HALL - UNIVERSITY OF ALBERTA +\nA301\n1\nA301\n2\nA302\n1\n87 m²\nFACULTY APARTMENT\n002\n75 m²\nMULTIPURPOSE SPACE\nX312\n56 m²\nCLASSROOM 1\n307.01\n56 m²\nMACKENZIE LOBBY\nX311\n1\nA401\n1\nA401\nTOC\n-940\nTOC\n-940\nTOC\n-940\nTOC\n-940\nINCOMING\nTRANFORMER\nPAD\nA302 2\n36 m²\nCOMM ROOM\n404.01\nVISITOR/TEMPORARY\nBIKE PARKING\nVISITOR DROP-OFF\nSOUTH ENTRY\nA3023\n48 m²\nMEDIA/GAMES\nROOM/MUSIC\n310\n73 m²\nFITNESS ROOM\n306\n17 m²\nRECYLYCING/TRASH\n407\n24 m²\nINCOMING ELEC.\nP122\n4295\nTOC\n-940\n7.61%\nBEDROOM\nOFFICE\nLIVING/ DINING\nLIVING/ DINING\n158 m²\nLIVING\nROOM/PARLOUR/REC\nLOUNGE\n303\n16 m²\nSTUDY 01\n301.01\n16 m²\nSTUDY 02\n301.02\n15 m²\nSTUDY 03\n301.03\n16 m²\nSTUDY 04\n301.04\n31 m²\nIND.

Mechanical, electrical and \ncivil all presented the systems abd design parameters to the team to \nensure that the path of design currently being pursued is still relevent  \nand agreed to. In addition to the review of the building components, \nthis meeting kicked off the detailed design of the landscape scope \nof work. The design team presented two concepts for work to be \ncompleted under this contract and oppertunities that might exist \nto integrate this facility further into the campus.

This \narea currently supports student parking for the Lister Centre and has an \noutdoor hockey rink installed adjacent the parking lot. The remainder of \nthe site is open park space with asphalt trails and pathways linking the \nHenday and Mackenzie halls to the rest of the campus circulation routes. \nThe Parcel of land selected by the U of A is of prime importance for the \nmain reason of proximity to the Lister Complex.  The goal of this project \nis to expand the Lister residence core and the only viable land available \nis the land to the south of the Centre. With this site being located to the \nsouth of the existing Lister centre, it is of critical importance to address \nthe existing towers and understand the relationship and impact that \nbuilding a tall building might have on the Henday and Mackenzie towers.  \nIt is for that very reason that the proposed design concept explored \na building that restricts its height, allowing the views and access to \nsunlight for the existing buildings to be maintained as much as possible. \nTopography\nThe existing site has a grade difference from high to low of approximately \n2 m (6 – 7 ft).  The design team has looked at this grade difference as \nan opportunity to use the grade difference and step the ground floor \nof the building and provide areas that would benefit from increased \nceiling height in locations at the lowest grade elevation of the site. This \nallows the program spaces such as the multi-purpose room, fitness \nand classrooms, to have increased volumes to enhance the program \nelements.  The lower grade also allows for an at grade access point to \nthe Mackenzie tower and ultimately to the Lister complex from the new \nLister 5 residence at a level that directly links all the residence towers \nand the main Lister centre building. As the site progresses south, the \ngrades rise and come up to the street level, so too does the building \ngrade level floor. Through a series of ramps, the main floor rises and \ntransitions from a more public social space, and rises a second time to \ncreate a more community minded resident accommodation area.  The \ngrading of the site is proposed to be maintained as much as possible, \nhowever re-grading on the south side of the new building will need to \noccur in order to keep the main floor grade transition to a manageable \nchange.  \n2.\n0 \nA\nR\nC\nH\nIT\nEC\nTU\nR\nA\nL\nLister 5\nDesign Development Report\n29\nSolar Access\nThe location of the site to the south of the existing Lister Complex provides direct access to south solar exposure. \nThe building is also exposed to early morning east and mid afternoon west sun angles giving the new facility, \nmaximum exposure to capitalize on the benefits of daylight. The location and design of the building also addressed \nthe impact of the new facility on the existing Henday and Mackenzie buildings, and the design team recognized \nthe need to minimize the shadow footprint of the new build in order to maintain access to the sun for the existing \nbuildings. The design team reviewed the impact of the building on the site from a shadow perspective and the \nfollowing images show the path of travel for the shadows created by the building at intervals throughout the year. \n2.\n0 \nA\nR\nC\nH\nIT\nEC\nTU\nR\nA\nL\n2.\n0 \nA\nR\nC\nH\nIT\nEC\nTU\nR\nA\nL\nShadow Studies\nLister 5\nDesign Development Report\n30\n2.\n0 \nA\nR\nC\nH\nIT\nEC\nTU\nR\nA\nL\n2.\n0 \nA\nR\nC\nH\nIT\nEC\nTU\nR\nA\nL\nShadow Studies\nLister 5\nDesign Development Report\n31\n2.\n0 \nA\nR\nC\nH\nIT\nEC\nTU\nR\nA\nL\n2.\n0 \nA\nR\nC\nH\nIT\nEC\nTU\nR\nA\nL\nShadow Studies\nLister 5\nDesign Development Report\n32\n2.\n0 \nA\nR\nC\nH\nIT\nEC\nTU\nR\nA\nL\nWind\nThe City of Edmonton is located in the area that is impacted by the \nupper level westerlies. This large scale atmosphere circulation flows in a \nwest to east direction the majority of the time.  The winter months see \nthis flow redirected slightly to a more northwest or northerly direction \nbringing down the arctic air as it flows south east. In the summer \nmonths the westerly winds bring the warm weather and moisture from \nthe West coast, across the Rocky Mountains to Central Alberta. Winter \nconditions can vary from year to year and snow accumulation depends \non the temperature and precipitation. Cold temperatures brought in by \nwinds from the north, produce snow and blizzard conditions and can \nbe expected year to year but are not frequent and do not last for long \nperiods of time.\nRain Fall/Precipitation\nEdmonton, Alberta can expect on average, 460 mm of rainfall per year or \n40 mm of rainfall per month. The rainfall is distributed over  an average \nof 122 days per year, each having more than .1 mm of rain or 10.2 days \nwith a quantity of rain, sleet snow etc. November is considered the \ndriest month of the year with the average precipitation accumulation \nof 16.1 mm.  July is found to be the wettest month of the year when \nexpected accumulation of rainfall is approximately 95mm.\nAverage Temperatures\nThe mean temperature in Edmonton is recorded at a cool 3.6 degrees \nCelsius, with a mean monthly temperature variation of 30 degrees \nCelsius.  The fluctuation / range of temperatures on the average day \nis approximately 10 deg. Celsius, with the average day in July being \nthe warmest days at 17.5 degrees Celsius, and January days being the \ncoldest with an average temperature of -12.5 degree Celsius. \n2.\n0 \nA\nR\nC\nH\nIT\nEC\nTU\nR\nA\nL\nLister 5\nDesign Development Report\n33\n2.\n0 \nA\nR\nC\nH\nIT\nEC\nTU\nR\nA\nL\nDESIGN CONCEPT\nThe project objectives articulated by the University of Alberta at the \nbeginning of the project remained the foundation for the development \nof the detailed design as represented in this report.\n“Transformation and community as the focus”\nContext/Building Placement\n1. The building has been organized in an “L” shape configuration to \ncreate new exterior spaces that are also an extension of the existing \nnetwork of outdoor spaces. \n2. The building has been carefully placed to allow enough distance \nbetween the new building, MacKenzie and Henday. Privacy, sun \npenetration and views have defined the proposed location. In \naddition to these parameters, the servicing strategy has also been \nconsidered in the shaping of the massing. The incoming electrical \nservices are anticipated to come from MacKenzie, while the \nmechanical services are anticipated to come from the utility corridor \nalong the east side of the site.\n3. The building massing has been shaped to create a link between \nMacKenzie Tower and the new building. This link is as an extension \nof the network of student spaces that is currently under review \nby the University of Alberta as a parallel project. The master plan \nprocess and relocation of social spaces has been key to the design \nevolution of the ground floor plan of the new building.  The main \namenity spaces that are intended to serve the building population \nand spaces that can be shared by the larger Lister complex have \nbeen placed on the ground floor along the west wing.\n4. The building has been placed to reinforce the streetscape developed \nalong the road access to the south of the site. The east-west corridor \ncreated between the south facade of the building and the street is \nvital to the engagement of the community and provides access to \nthe LRT station on the east side of the campus.\n5. The building height and program distribution have been carefully \nconsidered to minimize the impact on the adjacent Lister towers \nand maximize privacy and sun penetration into the open spaces \nseparating the new building from the existing buildings. The building \narea has been distributed within five floors and the low building \nheight is responsive to the residential community west of 117th \nstreet.\n6. The layby originally placed on the south side of the building in \nschematic design has been replaced with a promenade of trees and \nlandscape elements. short term loading has been accommodated \nin the parking lot with signed stalls located closest to the front \nentry. In addition to the parking stalls directly adjacent the building \nan additional 30 parking stalls are located across the street to the \nsouth and provides additional capacity to the development. This \nallows for separation of loading and community traffic, providing an \nimproved environment for community access through the site. The \ndesign build team is further exploring additional ways to improve \ncirculation and efficiency in the proposed parking area. The Design \nBuild will continue to develop the circulation to improve operational \nflow at the west parking and utility access.\n“Reinforce community in all aspects of the project”\nSpatial Organization\n1. The typical floor plan accommodates 4 houses or clusters. A house \nis defined as a group of bedrooms that include 27 students and a \nresident assistant. These bedrooms include double rooms as well as \nsingle rooms.\n2. The typical floor layout also includes study rooms, lounges and \nwashrooms that are shared by the 4 houses across the floor. The \nbedrooms, study rooms and lounges have been organized along the \nbuilding perimeter to maximize access to natural light.\n3. The massing configuration and typical floor layout are driven by \nthe concept of creating a sense of community at the floor level \nwhere there is a careful balance of privacy and a desire to create \nopportunities for different kinds of interaction.\n4. The bedrooms are organized along single loaded corridors that \nare separated from the other bedrooms by the introduction of \ncentral shared washrooms. The corridors have been designed to \nbe generous in width, short in length with views to the outside \nand interrupted by carefully placed social spaces such as the study \nrooms and lounges. \n5. The triangulation at the center of the wings is the result of a deliberate \nattempt to create interesting spaces at the crossroads of corridors \nand social areas. The triangulation also provides the opportunity to \ninterrupt potentially long corridors that have a singular direction. \nThe triangulation also allows for an efficient balance of bedroom \nareas relative to support spaces that don’t require natural light such \nas the washrooms.\n6. The washrooms have been designed the principles of equality and \naccessibility. Washrooms have been designed to be a combination \nof gender-neutral, gender specific and fully accessible. The resident \nfloor washrooms have been designed to satisfy the University's \nmandated one fixture per four residents, which is a higher total \nnumber than building code requirement and provides choice and \nconvenience at peak times.\n7. Vertical integration is also key to creating a strong community. \nStairs have been strategically located along the building perimeter. \nThey are located at the entrance connection to MacKenzie, at the \ncrossroads between the east and west wings and at the east end of \nthe building. Interior and exterior glazing will support wayfinding. \nGlazing will provide natural light into the stairwells to create spaces \nthat encourage students to use the stairs as the main access to the \nupper floors rather than the elevators.\n8. The ground floor amenity spaces have been organized to follow \na progression of public (open to the larger campus community) \nto semi-public spaces (related to the Lister 5 community).  The \nMacKenzie connection is aligned with the interior galleria or \ngenerous corridor space overlooking the central green space. The \ngalleria provides access to a sequence of amenity spaces that \nincludes the multipurpose room, the classroom, fitness area, games \nroom and individual study spaces. The south end of the galleria \ncontains the living room/parlor and central kitchen space or central \ngathering space. This space is the heart of the Lister 5 community \nwhere faculty and students will congregate.\n9. The east side of the ground floor resembles the organization of the \ntypical upper floor but also accommodates other functions such as \nthe mechanical room and the residence coordinator apartment.\nExterior Building Expression\nThe exterior façade design reinforces the planning concepts.  Natural \nlight is critical to creating livable communities. The typical room has \nbeen designed to allow for continuous glazing along the width of the \nroom. A linear window extends from wall to wall within the room and it \n2.\n0 \nA\nR\nC\nH\nIT\nEC\nTU\nR\nA\nL\nLister 5\nDesign Development Report\n34\nhas been provided with operable windows. \nDuring the Design Development Phase, a lot of discussion and review \nof the fenestration pattern and its impact on the exterior massing \nperception was conducted. The desire to identify the structure into  \ndistinct building elements that would break up the large perceived mass \nof the building into volumes that were more responsive to the adjacent \ncommunity was conveyed. The use of glazed vertical elements at the \nsocial spaces on the resident floors, provided separation of the building \nfacade into smaller and more scalable components. By eliminating \nthe ribbon linear window element and employing a series of punched \nwindows with varied cladding elements, the facade now achieves a \nmore residential scale and feel .\nThe lounges and study rooms are located at the intersection of the \ntriangular shapes of the plan and are intended to have a singular \nexpression on the outside that is recognizable. They have floor to ceiling \nglass to maximize the access to natural light given the nature of the \nfunctions within it. \nGlazing systems have been reviewed and selected based on thermal \nperformance and energy efficiency. The use of thermally broken \nwindow frames and double pane low 'E' argon filled glass units provides \na blend of performance and cost. These performance criteria were \nchosen to reduce heat transfer and loss to the exterior through the \nglazing. elements. Solar heat gain is also a concern for the building. \nThe design team has selected a glass unit that provides a mix of good \nsolar coefficient (.42.) and visible light transmittance of .63. This glass \n2.\n0 \nA\nR\nC\nH\nIT\nEC\nTU\nR\nA\nL\n2.\n0 \nA\nR\nC\nH\nIT\nEC\nTU\nR\nA\nL\nwill perform well in controlling solar gain and still maintain visual clarity \nfrom the inside. Adding solar shades to south and west facing spaces \nwill also improve solar gain and glare control. \nThe exterior cladding materials are used in conjunction to reinforce \nthe massing elements and the fenestration patterns. The vertical glass \nelements at the social spaces on the residential levels are accented with \na change in material and colour. The ground level also receives a change \nin material and colour to identify public space from residential areas. \nThe resident unit windows have received varied cladding elements to \ncreate a visually engaging facade.\nLister 5\nDesign Development Report\n35\n2.\n0 \nA\nR\nC\nH\nIT\nEC\nTU\nR\nA\nL\nSUSTAINABLE DESIGN\nThroughout the design development process, the building systems, \nmaterials and assemblies have been developed in more detail. Each \nof these building elements and assemblies work in conjunction to \nprovide the efficiencies and sustainability desired for this project. The \nmaterials, systems and assemblies have been reviewed and selected \nfor their performance characteristics and their contribution to the \nGreen Globe mandate. Progression from the pre-assessment phase to \nengaging the Green Globe Assessor will be undertaken once approval to \nproceed to Phase 2 has been received. At this stage the detailed review \nof the project with the Green Globe Assessor will take place and will \nprovide a more thorough breakdown on how this project will achieve its \nsustainable goals.\nThe University has clearly demonstrated their commitment to the \nenvironment and to the education of their students and staff by \nmandating this project be registered and evaluated with the Green \nGlobes Building rating system. The University has requested a minimum \nthreshold of a 3 out of 5 green globe rating to be the benchmark for \nsustainable design, and a desire to push the design team with the \nchallenge of attaining a 4 green globe rating while still maintaining the \nproject budget and schedule. In order to achieve the 3 green globe \nrating, an overall score of 55-69% must be achieved in the pursuit of \nthe sustainable initiatives. In order to achieve a 4 globe rating, the \nproject must achieve 70-84% success.  Currently the design team has \nbegun the pre-design process with the Green Globe rating system and \nthe mandate of a 3 green globe rating appears to be achievable.  As \nthe process moves forward, the design team will test the sustainability \nconcepts against the green globe rating system and determine the best \nand most valuable means and methods to see if the 4th green globe is \nachievable with in the design and budget parameter provided.  \nSome of the sustainable design considerations and concepts include:\n• Building envelope efficiency.\n - Increased effective RSI wall values through the use of insulation \nclips\n - Elimination of thermal bridging components pentrating the \nbuilding envelope. \n - Increases roof insulation values based on effective RSI calculations \nvs component RSI calculations.\n• Energy usage and selection of systems.\n - Use of heat recovery in mechanical systems.\n - Use of low flow fixtures2.\n0 \nA\nR\nC\nH\nIT\nEC\nTU\nR\nA\nL\nLister 5\nDesign Development Report\n36\n2.\n0 \nA\nR\nC\nH\nIT\nEC\nTU\nR\nA\nL\n - Connection to existing University Central Plant.\n• Selection of products and materials.\n - Use of local materials where possible.\n - Use of durable and materials.\n - Selection of products with recyclable content.\n - Selection of low maintenance, long life cycle materials. \n• Connection and use of existing infrastructure.\n - Use of existing University Central Plant and tie ins to existing usable \ninfrastructure. \n• Natural lighting characteristics.\n - Orientation and size of windows in critical spaces to provide proper \nnatural lighting to reduce artificial light requirements and provide \nhealthy environments.\n - Provide views to the exterior campus to capitalize on the mental \nbenefits of a perceived connection to the outdoors.\n• Access to views, both from the building and adjacent buildings.\n• Planning for future sustainable concepts that might be employed \nafter the project is completed.\n - Incorporate into the building design, components and systems that \ncan accommodate future photo voltaic panel arrays on the roof. \nLIFE SAFETY\nAs the project developed during the Design Development Phase, the \nbuilding life safety conditions were continuously reviewed to ensure \nthat the proposed design meets all applicable code requirements. The \nlife safety planning layouts illustrate the travel paths to required exits as \nwell and identifying the occupant loads and required exit capacities. Also \ndepicted on the life safety layouts are the required fire rated partitions \nas required by the Alberta Building Code.\nThe purpose of the code review is to maintain the life and fire safety \nrequirements intrinsic in to the design process and make sure that the \nproposed schematic design concept will meet all applicable life safety \nand fire codes as set out in the 2014 Alberta Building Code. This will \nbe an ongoing process to test the design throughout the design and \nconstruction phases and ensure that the building will adhere to all \napplicable codes.  The Alberta Code 2014, NFPA 2010, and all other \npertinent and relevant building codes, will form the basis of the code \ncompliance documentation.

to be provided for occupants of the building in accordance with Sentence 3.7.2.2.(6).  \nIn order to determine the main floor washroom requirements, a calculation of the required fixtures was completed using occupancy \nnumbers based on whether or not the user was a resident of the Lister 5 facility or not. This rationale was employed under the guise that \nstudents who reside in the Lister 5 facility will already have been accounted for in the washroom calculations for each residence floor, \nthereby these students who live in the residence and use the main floor level, will have access to the washrooms on their residential \nlevels. The washrooms provided on the main floor are calculated on the assumed occupant load that would not be resident in the Lister \n5 facility. All washrooms on the resident floors have been designed to achieve the required occupant ratios as indicated in the building \ncode as well as meeting the U of A requirement of 1 fixture for every 4 residents, spread out equally on each resident floor level.\n2.\n0 \nA\nR\nC\nH\nIT\nEC\nTU\nR\nA\nL\n2.\n0 \nA\nR\nC\nH\nIT\nEC\nTU\nR\nA\nL\nLister 5\nDesign Development Report\n48\nThe following table identifies the required number of water closets based on the total occupant load for each building:\n3.7.2.2 Water Closets\n(5) The number of water closets required for a care and residential occupancy shall be at least one for each 10 persons of each sex.\n3.7.2.3 Lavatories\n1) Except as permitted by Sentence (2), at least one lavatory shall be provided in a room containing one or 2 water closets or urinals, and at least one additional lavatory shall \nbe provided for each additional 2 water closets or urinals. \n10.0 AIR LEAKAGE\n10.1 All new buildings in Alberta are required to incorporate Radon mitigation strategies.

Based on the floor by floor breakdown each \nresident floors is adequately served by the ratio of washrooms to residents. The main floor is \ncomprised of a combination of resident usage and out of facility users.  Based on our reviews for \nthe main floor spaces, the breakdown of resident users to non-resident users would be \napproximately 100 non-resident users vs 124 resident users.  As the resident users have access \nto the washroom facilities on their living floors we have not included main floor washrooms to \naccommodate these users. Therefore the main floor washroom calculations has been based on \nan occupancy of 118 people. \n The following table identifies the required number of water closets based on the total occupant \nload for each building: \nArea \nOccupant Load \n(persons) \nNumber of Water \nClosets Required \nNumber of Water \nClosets Provided \nMain Floor  \nMale  50 2 Toilets, 1 Lavatories 2 Toilets, 1 Lavatories \nFemale 50 2 Toilets, 1 Lavatories 2 Toilets, 2 Lavatories \nMale – residence rooms 22 3 Toilets, 2 Lavatories 4 Toilets, 4 Lavatories \nFemale – residence rooms 22 3 Toilets, 2 Lavatories 5 Toilets, 5 Lavatories \nResidence floors \nMale 54 6 Toilets, 3 Lavatories 12 Toilets, 12 Lavatories \nFemale 53 6 Toilets, 3 Lavatories 12 Toilets, 12 Lavatories \n 3.7.2.2 Water Closets \n (5) The number of water closets required for a care and residential occupancy shall be at \nleast one for each 10 persons of each sex. \n 3.7.2.3 Lavatories \n (1) Except as permitted by Sentence (2), at least one lavatory shall be provided in a room \ncontaining one or 2 water closets or urinals, and at least one additional lavatory shall be \nprovided for each additional 2 water closets or urinals.  \n10.0 AIR LEAKAGE \n10.1 All new buildings in Alberta are required to incorporate Radon mitigation strategies.

recommended overall structural systems \nproposed for the new Lister Hall Residence at the University of Alberta \nand the applicable building code requirements that govern the design.\nStructurally, our challenge is not only to look at the building as a static \nstructure, but to also be concerned with how the building might evolve \nas occupant needs change, or how it will accommodate the rapid growth \nof information technology, and to ensure that the structural systems \nchosen is flexible to accommodate those future changes.\nThese issues are as important as the structural design of the building \nitself and become an important factor when choosing the structural \nsystem of the building.\nThe structural systems for the Lister Hall Residence have also been \ndeveloped to be cost-effective, and responsive to the architectural \nrequirements for the building within a framework of environmental \nsustainability.\nIn choosing the structural systems for the Lister Hall Residence, emphasis \nwas given to the following items\nSafety\nThe design of all structural systems will meet or exceed all applicable \nCSA Standards, thus providing a safe environment for its occupants for \nyears to come.\nEconomically Responsible\nWith the current economic conditions in the Alberta, preference will be \ngiven to structural systems that are widely available, thus minimizing \nthe risk of labour shortage.\nBudget reviews and comparisons with the Architect and Owner will be \nmade throughout the design stage to ensure the budgetary goals set for \nthe project are being achieved.\nFunctionality\nThe recommended structural component is cast-in-place concrete. Cast-\nin-place concrete is an excellent structural system that can be custom \ndesigned to meet stringent vibration and deflection specifications as \nwell as provide good acoustic values and fire resistance\nDurability\nThe structural system has been chosen to reduce on-going maintenance \ncosts.\nGreen Design\nConsideration has been given to structural materials with high recycled \nmaterial content. Recycled materials such as fly ash will be specified for \nuse in the concrete mix designs.\nDESIGN CRITERIA\nThe structural design is to be undertaken in accordance with the latest \ncodes and standards, including but not limited to:\n• Alberta Building Code 2014 Edition (ABC 2014)\n• Structural Steel Design CAN/CSA-S16\n• Reinforced Concrete Design CAN/CSA-A23.3\n• Cold Formed Steel Design CSA S136\nDesign Dead Load\nThe structural design dead load is to incorporate the actual anticipated \nloads in various designated areas. The minimum design dead loads for \neach of following areas are:\n• Typical Floor = 5.8kPa\n• Roof  = 5.8kPa\nThe above loads may not govern all areas and some portions of the \nbuilding may require individual consideration.\nDesign Live Load due to Occupancy\nThe design live loads for each of the areas and occupancies of the \nbuilding will be as a minimum in accordance with the recommended \nlive loads stipulated in the ABC 2014 unless listed below. \n• Residential Areas    = 1.9kPa\n• Washroom Areas   = 2.4kPa\n• Corridors and Common Areas = 4.8kPa\n• Mechanical Room   = 7.2kPa\n• Roof    = 1.5kPa\nThe structural design is to incorporate the actual anticipated loads in the \nvarious designated areas, which are unique to the building occupancy, \nand all equipment loads which will be individually considered.\nDesign Live Loads due to Snow, Ice and Rain\nTThe structure of the roof is to be designed using the normal importance \ncategory as described in table 4.1.2.1 in the ABC for a 1-in-50 year \nground snow load and accompanying rain load stipulated in Appendix C \nof the ABC. An importance factor of 1.0 is to be used for Ultimate Limit \nStates (ULS) design and an importance factor of 0.9 is to be used for \nServiceability Limit States (SLS) design. The loads on sloping roofs and \naccumulations on roofs adjacent to projections of other portions of the \nstructure will be as specified in the ABC.\nThe structure of the roof is also to be designed to support the \naccumulation of rainwater on a surface from the one-day rainfall as \nstipulated in the ABC.\n3.\n0 \nST\nR\nU\nC\nTU\nR\nA\nL\nLister 5\nDesign Development Report\n81\nThe snow load and rain data for Edmonton is as follows:\n• Ss = 1.7kPa\n• Sr = 0.1kPa\n• One day rain (1/50) = 97mm\nDesign Load due to Wind\nThe main structure of the residence building is to be designed using the \nnormal importance category as described in table 4.1.2.1 for a 1-in-50 \nyear hourly wind pressure loads as stipulated in the ABC. An importance \nfactor of 1.0 is to be used for the ULS design and an importance factor \nof 0.75 is to be used for SLS design. The internal pressure category as \ndescribed in Commentary I of the User’s Guide, NBC 2010 Structural \nCommentaries is category 2. The wind drift for the structure will be \nlimited to h/500 where h is the height of the structure. Wind uplift \npressure will be provided on the structural drawings for design of the \nindividual structural roof components. \nThe wind data for Edmonton is as follows:\n• Wind Pressure (1/50) = 0.45kPa\nDesign Load due to Earthquake\nThe main structure of the residence building will be designed using the \nnormal importance category as described in table 4.1.2.1 to withstand \nthe lateral forces that may occur as a result of ground acceleration. The \n5%-damped horizontal spectral acceleration values for periods T of 0.2, \n0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 seconds and the peak ground acceleration (PGA) value \nfor earthquake design as stipulated in the ABC is to be considered. An \nimportance factor of 1.0 is to be used for ULS design. Based off the \ngeotechnical evaluation report prepared by Thurber Engineering Ltd. \nthe site classification for the subject site is Class C.\nThe seismic data for Edmonton and a Class C site are as follows:\n• Sa(0.2) = 0.10\n• Sa(0.5) = 0.06\n• Sa(1.0) = 0.03\n• Sa(2.0) = 0.01\n• PGA = 0.04\n• Fa = 1.0\n• Fv = 1.0\nThe SFRS Ductility-Related Force Modification Factor and Overstrength-\nRelated Force Modification Factor are as follows: \n• Rd = 1.5\n• Ro = 1.3\n• \nThe drift limit under seismic loads for normal importance structures is \n0.025hs where hs is the overall height of the structure.\nBUILDING STRUCTURE\nProposed Construction Materials\nThe following construction materials are proposed for the Lister Hall \nResidence Building:  \nReinforcing Steel for Concrete and Masonry – 400W\nConcrete: \n• Foundation Concrete - 25MPa @ 28 days (GU cement)\n• Slab on Grade - 25MPa @ 28 days (GU cement)\n• Structural Stoops - 35MPa @ 28 days (GU cement)\n• Sidewalks - 32MPa @ 28days (GU cement)\n• Building Columns and Walls – 30MPa to 35MPa @ 28 days (GU \ncement)\n• Upper Level Structural Slabs – 35MPa @ 28 days (GU cement)\nStructural Steel – 350W\nCold Formed Steel – 228MPa\nFoundation System\nThe foundation design will be based off design recommendations from \nthe geotechnical report prepared by Thurber Engineering Ltd. dated \nDecember 2, 2015 and titled ‘University of Alberta Main Campus – Lister \n5 Residential Building’. Piles and grade beams with void form are feasible \nfor the proposed site. The recommended pile types include concrete \nend bearing piles, concrete skin friction piles, continuous flight auger \npiles. Some sand layers are present and some seepage was noted which \ncan add difficulty to pile installation and perhaps require casing. The \nfactored design parameters presented in the geotechnical report for the \npile options are as follows: \nConcrete End Bearing Piles:\n• End Bearing = 800kPa (Below 13m)\nSkin Friction Piles:\n• 0 – 1.5m = 0kPa\n• 1.5m – 6m = 12kPa\n• 6m – 12m = 20kPa\n• 12m – 18m = 32kPa\nContinuous Flight Auger Piles:\n• 0 – 1.5m = 0kPa\n• 1.5m – 6m = 12kPa\n• 6m – 12m = 20kPa\n• 12m – 18m = 32kPa\n• End Bearing = 800kPa (Below 13m)\nNegligible concentrations of water soluble sulphate were encountered \nin the soils therefore type GU cement can be utilized for all foundation \nconcrete.\nMain Floor\nThe main floor will consist of a minimum 130 mm reinforced cast-in-place \nconcrete slab on grade on a soil gas impermeable vapour suppression \nmembrane / vapour barrier as per the architectural requirements \nsupported on compacted, clean, well-graded granular base over suitable \nbearing soils. The sub-grade preparation must be done in conformance \nwith the recommendations outline in the geotechnical report to \nminimize potential slab movements.\nCast-in-place concrete structurally supported floors on void form will \nbe provided for all exterior concrete stoops at doorways and any other \nareas which may be designated as “sensitive to movement” and where \nexcessive amount of fill material are present.\nTypical Upper Floor System\nThe typical upper floor structure will consist of a minimum 200mm flat \nplate concrete slab supported by concrete columns. The floor structures \nwill be designed based on a total load deflection of L/360 and a live load \ndeflection of L/480.\n3.\n0 \nST\nR\nU\nC\nTU\nR\nA\nL\n3.\n0 \nST\nR\nU\nC\nTU\nR\nA\nL\nLister 5\nDesign Development Report\n82\n• Concrete roof structure will allow for future flexibility of the roof \nto accommodate future mechanical roof top equipment as well as \nfuture solar panels as required.\nDELEGATED STRUCTURAL DESIGN\nThe design of some of the structural components will be delegated to \nothers. These components include the concrete mix design, structural \nsteel connections for any miscellaneous steel components, and wind \nbearing metal studs. The structural drawings and specifications will \nprovide the necessary design criteria, specifications and relevant \ninformation for the design of these components. Shop drawings for \nthese components signed and sealed by the professional engineer \nresponsible for their design will be required to be submitted by the \ncontractor and these shop drawings shall be reviewed by the general \ncontractor as well as the relevant consultants for general conformance \nto the project requirements and specifications.\nGREEN GLOBES DESIGN\nIn terms of the structure of the building, environmental responsibility \nis achieved by using construction materials high in recycled content. \nFor the concrete component of the structure, an effective mix may be \ndesigned where fly ash, slag or silica fume replace a certain percentage \nof the cementations materials. Replacing Portland Cement with recycled \ncontent in this way is a sustainable design choice that will also result \nin a cost savings. Recycled aggregate can also be used successfully in \nconcrete structures as well as for compacted granular fill below slab on \ngrade.\nTypical Roof System\nThe typical roof structure will consist of a minimum 200mm flat plate \nconcrete slab supported by concrete columns. The roof structures will \nbe designed based on a total load deflection of L/240 and a live load \ndeflection of L/360.\nThe roof structure shall also be designed to support equipment installed \nabove the roof structure as well as the potential for future solar panels. \nRefer to the architectural and the mechanical layout for locations, \nweights and sizes of the equipment above the roof structure.\nLateral Load Resisting System\nThe lateral load resisting system will consist of conventional concrete \nshear walls.\nConnection Link Structural System\nThe connection link between the new and existing residence building \nwill be constructed with structural steel beams and columns supporting \nsteel roof deck\nUtilidor Structural System\nThe underground utilidor connecting between the existing utilidor and \nthe new residence building will be constructed of cast in place concrete. \nEmbed plates will be provided for support of the pipe racks and uni-\nstruts as per the details provided for a previously constructed utilidor.\nALTERNATE STRUCTURAL SYSTEM\nAlternate structural systems were considered for the project. Some of \nthe benefits and reasons why a concrete structure was selected include \nthe following:\n• Concrete structure has thinner floor structural depth relative to \nother structural systems considered thus reducing overall building \nheights.\n• Concrete structure allows for future flexibility as partition walls can \nbe easily removed. Some of the other structural systems considered \nused the walls as load bearing therefore requiring the walls remain.\n• Concrete structures have good vibration and acoustic characteristic \nwhich are important considerations for a residence building.\n• Concrete structure has good fire resistance characteristics. Other \nstructural systems rely on gypsum board and other fire protection \nproducts to provide the necessary fire resistance.3.\n0 \nST\nR\nU\nC\nTU\nR\nA\nL\n3.\n0 \nST\nR\nU\nC\nTU\nR\nA\nL\nLister 5\nDesign Development Report\n83\nPILE LAYOUT PLAN\n3.\n0 \nST\nR\nU\nC\nTU\nR\nA\nL\n3.\n0 \nST\nR\nU\nC\nTU\nR\nA\nL\nB1\nB2\nB3\nB4\nC1\nC2\nC3\nC4\nC5\nC6\nC7\n7a\n7b\n8b\n8c\n2y\nA1\nA2\nA3\nA4\nA5\n1\n1a 2 2a 2b 2c\n2d\nAx\nBx\nH1\nH2\nH4\n6a\n6b\n5a\n5b\nE1\nE2\nE3\nE4\nE5\nD1\nD2\nD3\n4a\n4b\n4c\n4d\nF1\nF2\nF3\nF4\nF5\nF6\nG1\nG2\nG3\nG4\nG5\n3a\n3b\nH3\n'P2\n'\n'P2\n'\n'P1\n'\n'P1\n'\n'P1\n'\n'P2\n'\n'P2\n'\n'P2\n'\n'P4\n'\n'P3\n'\n'P3\n'\n'P2\n'\n'P2\n'\n'P2\n'\n'P3\n'\n'P3\n'\n'P3\n'\n'P3\n'\n'P3\n'\n'P2\n'\n'P3\n'\n'P2\n'\n'P2\n'\n'P2\n'\n'P4\n'\n'P4\n'\n'P2\n'\n'P2\n'\n'P4\n'\n'P4\n'\n'P4\n'\n'P3\n'\n'P3\n'\n'P2\n'\n'P2\n'\n'P2\n'\n'P3\n'\n'P2\n'\n'P3\n'\n'P3\n'\n'P2\n'\n'P2\n'\n'P2\n'\n'P2\n' 'P2\n'\n'P2\n'\n'P2\n'\n'P3\n'\n'P2\n'\n'P3\n'\n'P3\n''P\n3'\n'P4\n'\n'P4\n'\n'P3\n'\n'P3\n'\n'P3\n'\n'P3\n'\n'P3\n'\n'P3\n'\n'P3\n'\n'P3\n'\n'P2\n'\n'P2\n'\n'P3\n'\n'P3\n'\n'P2\n'\n'P2\n'\n'P1\n'\n'P1\n'\n'P3\n'\n'P3\n'\n'P2\n'\n'P2\n'\n'P2\n'\n'P1\n'\n'P2\n'\n'P2\n'\n'P2\n'\n'P2\n'\n'P2\n'\n'P2\n'\n'P2\n'\n'P2\n'\n'P2\n'\n'P2\n'\n'P2\n'\n'P2\n'\n'P2\n'\n'P2\n'\n'P2\n'\n'P2\n'\n'P2\n'\n'P1\n' 'P\n1'\n'P2\n'\n'P2\n'\n'P2\n'\n'P2\n'\n'P2\n'\n'P1\n'\n'P1\n'\n'P1\n'\n'P1\n'\n'P1\n'\n'P1\n'\n'P1\n'\n'P1\n'\n'P5\n'\n'P5\n'\n'P1\n'\n'P1\n''P5\n''\nP5\n'\n'P5\n'\n'P5\n'\n'P5\n'\n'P5\n'\n'P5\n'\n'P5\n'\n'P1\n'\n'P1\n'\n'P5\n'\n'P5\n'\n'P5\n'\n'P5\n'\n'P5\n'\n'P3\n'\n'P5\n'\n'P5\n'\n'P5\n'\n'P1\n'\n'P1\n'\n'P5\n'\n'P5\n'\n'P1\n'\n'P1\n'\n1.

Domestic hot water is generated \nby indirect steam domestic hot water tanks.\nThe primary heating source for the building is steam provided by the \nUniversity’s central plant which provides hydronic heating to the \nbuilding through shell and tube type heat exchangers. Heating water is \ndistributed throughout the building to terminal units and air-handling \nunit heating coils by circulation pumps. Baseboard radiation provides \nheating to the residence suites and common areas.\nChilled water is provided to the building from the University’s central \nplant and is distributed through the building by circulation pumps to \nterminal units and air-handling unit cooling coils. Cooling is provided to \ncommon the areas only through fan coil units.\nVentilation and exhaust is provided throughout the building by two \nroof mounted air-handling unit. The temperature of the supply air is \ncontrolled through hydronic heating and cooling coils. Each unit contains \nan energy recovery wheel to increase energy efficiency.\nControl of the mechanical systems is provided by a building energy \nmanagement control system.\nIntroduction\nThe purpose of the Mechanical Design Development report is to convey \nthe fundamental system design philosophy to the Owner and Design \nTeam. This report presents mechanical systems that include but are not \nlimited to the following major systems:\n• Heating system\n• Ventilation system\n• Storm sewer system\n• Sanitary sewer system\n• Domestic hot/cold systems\n• Exhaust air systems\nIt is the design intent to provide mechanical systems that are energy \nefficient, reliable, require minimal maintenance and meet the owners’ \nrequirements.\nDesign Criteria\nThe mechanical systems for the building will be designed and installed \nto obtain the best possible building occupant comfort, with an \nacceptable capital expenditure. The design will strive for optimum \nenergy consumption and economical operation. This will be achieved \nusing modern mechanical systems and equipment utilizing energy \nconservation techniques and energy management control systems.\nMechanical systems will be designed in accordance with all applicable \ncodes and ordinances. The design will be based on the Alberta Building \nRegulations, Canadian Plumbing and Drainage Regulations, University of \nAlberta Design Guidelines, and the latest editions of ASHRAE standards \nand guidelines.\nThe mechanical design will meet the Owner’s requirements to create \na desired place for students to live, study and socialize on campus. The \nmechanical systems will mainly address these requirements by providing \na thermally comfortable environment through energy efficient systems.\nTemperature\nThe following conditions will be utilized in the design of the system:\n  Outdoor Indoor\nSummer 28oC DB  24oC DB  (in air conditioned  \n       spaces – all common  \n      program space)\n    Variable (in non-air   \n      conditioned spaces –  \n      all residence suites  \n      and service space )\n  17oC WB\nWinter  -33oC DB 21oC DB\nA thermal comfort analysis based on the methodology of ASHRAE \nStandard 55 was performed to determine the time period in which \nthe thermal comfort in the residence suite would be accetable to the \noccupants. It is estimated that the temperature in the suites will be \nwithin an acceptable range for thermal comfort for the duration of the \nyear other than approximately 60 hours for suites facing south and west \nand approximately 30 hours for suites facing north and east. According \nto this standard, a maximum acceptable temperature in the summer \nwould be 27oC. Thermal comfort in cooling season will be achieved by \nsupplying tempered ventilation air (at 18oC) directly to the suites and \nthrough the use of natural ventilation via operable windows. The use \nof internal shading devices could decrease the amount of time that the \nsuite space temperatures are outside the range for acceptable thermal \ncomfort by approximately 25%. Windows with a solar coefficient of 0.42 \nand visible light transmittance of 0.63 were utilized for cooling load \ncalculations.\nDesign guidelines for HVAC-related background noise will be as \nper ASHRAE recommendations.

Light \nsources throughout will be LED luminaires within the suites and \nfluorescent lighting in all other areas throughout the facility. Lighting \nsystems will be line voltage system with a combination of local and \nautomatic controls that are interface with the Building Automation \nSystem.\nA high voltage 13.8kV service entry switchgear and pad mounted 13.8kV \n/ 208V transformer will be provided by the University of Alberta for \nelectrical utilities. The primary service will be routed from Lister Centre \nto the facility’s centrally located main electrical room by the electrical \ncontractor. 120/208V, 3-phase, 4-wire panelboards will be distributed \nthroughout the facility for all general power uses. Panelboards located \nwithin the student suite areas will be accessible to the students so \nbreaker trips can be reset by the students without involving University \nof Alberta Facility and Operations maintenance staff.\nThe main communications room and sub communications rooms are \nlocated strategically to limit cabling distances to end devices. The wireless \nsystem will provide “paint to paint” coverage throughout the facility. \nThe network fibre services will be routed by the electrical contractor \nfrom Lister Centre to the main communications room. Considerations \nfor students to procure external internal service provider connections \nhave been discussed but further review and design will be established \nin the Contract Document phase.\nA card access security and CCTV system will monitor the main entrances \nas well as the student and facility suite entrances.\nMass notification and general paging will be deployed through the fire \nalarm speaker system.\nAudio/visual systems will be designed within the common lounge spaces \nas well as the multi-purpose rooms.\nDesign Criteria\nThe electrical design will be based on the following applicable University \nof Alberta and other applicable standards including:\n• University of Alberta, Facilities Management Commissioning \nManual.\n• University of Alberta, Electrical Design Guidelines.\n• University of Alberta, Guidelines for Design and Installation of \nStreet, Sidewalk and Area Lighting – Revised October 2000.\n• University of Alberta, Fire Alarm Design Standards, draft copy issued \nJanuary 2005.\n• University of Alberta, Electric Utility Standards, draft issued \nDecember 2004.\n• ANSI, IEEE, EEMAC Standard for High and Low Voltage Switchgear.\n• Latest adopted Canadian Electrical Code – Part I.\n• Regulations of the Alberta Electrical Protection Branch – Safety \nCodes Act.\n• Latest Alberta Building Code.\n• Latest Alberta Fire Code.\n• CSA Standard C282-05 Emergency Electrical Power Supply for \nBuildings.\n• CSA Standard B651-95 Barrier Free Design.\n• Latest CSA Fire Alarm Standards and ULC Standards.\n• Latest Illuminating Engineering Society of North America (IESNA) \nStandards.\n• IST Telecommunications Design Guidelines, University of Alberta \nCabling Standards (Version 2.4, May 2, 2016).\n• University of Alberta, Lighting Design Guidelines and Standards \n(January 2009, Revision 0.2).\nEach system presented in this report will be open to further in-\ndepth review with the user groups and University of Alberta Facility \nManagement group.  \nSustainable Design Considerations\nThe Lister 5 Residence design will be based upon achieving a Green 5.\n0 \nEL\nEC\nTR\nIC\nA\nL\nEXAMPLE OF LIGHTING PRECEDENCE\nLister 5\nDesign Development Report\n100\n5.\n0 \nEL\nEC\nTR\nIC\nA\nL\nGlobes 3 minimum certification. The rationale for engaging in sustainable \ndesign is to create a facility that will contribute to reduced demands on \nthe earth resources. There are four areas that are impacted by engaging \nGreen Globe practices into electrical systems including:\n• energy conservation,\n• light pollution reduction, and\n• indoor environmental quality.\nSustainability design for the Lister 5 Residence will be considered based \non how Facilities and Operations can maintain these systems and have \nthe budgets to sustain the systems for operations and replacement of \nthese systems. Further review of these systems will be required during \nthe next phase of design.\nIn discussions with the University of Alberta, a sub-metering system will \nnot be required on each floor. Metering will only be provided at the \nservice entrance.\nEnergy Conservation\nElectrical energy comprises a small portion of the total energy consumed \nby a facility but when expressed in actual utility costs, the electrical \nsystem consumes approximately 20 - 40% of the total building’s energy \nbudget. The following initiatives will be adopted in the design to reduce \nthe building’s energy consumption:\n1. Use the latest illumination technology including a combination of \nLED and fluorescent.\n2. The Minimum Energy Performance prerequisite in Green Globes is \nintended to comply with the minimum level of energy efficiency as \nspecified in latest version of ASHRAE 90.1.\n3. Other measures that can further improve the baseline energy \nperformance is the use of occupancy sensors, dimming controls, \nphotocells, and improved local controls. An interface to the \nUniversity’s building automation system (BACNet) will optimize the \nuse of lighting and ventilation systems when a space is occupied and \nreduced usage when spaces are not occupied. \n4. Engineered lighting systems to provide appropriate lighting levels \nthat are safe and effective. Lighting will comply with prescribed \nguidelines rather than using light levels that are on the high end \nof the IESNA (Illuminating Engineering Society of North America) \nstandard. It is proposed that lower ambient lighting levels be \nemployed in offices, suites, circulation spaces, and corridors.\n5. The following non-Green Globes energy efficient design parameters \nwill be considered:\n 1. Use of soft start or VFDs for larger motor loads to help reduce \npeak power demand.\n 2. Power distribution centres will be located as close as possible to \ntheir connected loads, thereby minimizing the length of branch \ncircuit wiring which in turn will improve the voltage regulation.\n 3. Designated equipment to have “manual-off-automatic” con-\ntrols such that they can be run in manual mode or automatically \nthrough the building management system.\n 4. The design will favor the use of environmentally friendly compo-\nnents such as LED lamps which have no mercury content.\nLighting Control of Perimeter and Non-Perimeter Spaces\nAn option discussed with the University of Alberta was to consider an \nadvanced digital lighting control system technology but wasn’t deemed \nviable for this type of building.  \nA line voltage control system with occupancy and daylight sensors will \nbe used in combination throughout this building with a connection to \nthe BMS system.  \nELECTRICAL SYSTEMS\nService\nA 13.8kV primary service will be provided from Lister Centre into \nUniversity of Alberta provided high-voltage switchgear and pad-mounted \n13.8kV / 208V transformer. \nConsiderations for a 347/600V have been discussed due to mechanical \nloading but further review will be needed in the Contract Document \nphase.\n5.\n0 \nEL\nEC\nTR\nIC\nA\nL\nEXAMPLE OF LIGHTING PRECEDENCE\nLister 5\nDesign Development Report\n101\n5.\n0 \nEL\nEC\nTR\nIC\nA\nL\nPower Distribution System Design\nThe total calculated demand load for Lister 5 Residence is estimated at \napproximately 330kW based on a building size of 109,000 ft2. A 1600A, \n120/208V service is estimated but the calculated demand loads and \nhistoric peak demand of the other Lister residences will need to be further \nreviewed with University of Alberta Electrical Utilities to determine a \nsuitable size pad-mounted transformer and main distribution panel.\nMain Electrical Room \nIn the earlier phases of development of the program space, the main \nelectrical room was located at the north end of the building. It was then \nrelocated to be more central to reduce the feeder lengths to the upper \nfloor distribution and to the main mechanical room.\nThe main electrical room will consist of a high voltage room housing \nthe 13.8kV service entry rated switchgear and a medium voltage room \nhousing a 120/208V, 3 phase 4 wire main distribution panel.\nThe Lister 5 Residence service entrance switchgear will be metal \nenclosed 15kV rated indoor style load break fused switching devices \nand vacuum circuit breakers. All low voltage switchgear (208V) will be \nmetal-enclosed indoor rated, with withdrawable-type power-air circuit \nbreakers complete with programmable protective relays.\nNormal Power Distribution\nThe standard operating, distribution and utilization voltages for Lister \n5 Residence will be 120/208V, 3-phase, 4-wire. A sufficient number of \n120/208V panelboards will be located in the suite areas to maintain \nrequired voltage levels. The panelboards will have a minimum of 25% \nspare for future use.\nEmergency Power Distribution\nAll life safety systems will be backed up by battery units for lighting, exit \nlighting and fire alarm systems. \nGrounding and Bonding\nGrounding system has been designed to provide a low impedance path \nfor ground fault currents to flow. \nEach of the electrical rooms will have a grounding bus connected to \nthe building's main system ground, which in turn will be connected to \nthe ground grid. All non-current-carrying metal parts of equipment in \nthe electrical rooms will be bonded to ground per Canadian Electrical \nCode. This will include all metal raceways, equipment enclosures, metal \nstructures, low tension systems, and miscellaneous metal systems. A \nbonding conductor will be provided in each conduit.\nEach of the telecommunication rooms will have a grounding bus \nconnected to the building's main system ground, which in turn will be \nconnected to the ground grid. \nArc Flash Coordination Study\nAn arc flash coordination study will be provided for this project.\nGeneral Wiring\nAll wiring will be installed in conduit. Copper wiring is recommended \nto be used in this facility however aluminum wiring has been accepted \nas a cost saving initiative on conductors larger than 200A on previous \nprojects and should be considered for this project.\nThe use of cable tray systems will only be used in accessible ceiling \nspaces where required.\nAlternate wiring methods being considered are as follows:\n1. Aluminum wiring to be considered for conductors 200A and larger.\nCabling for life safety systems such as elevators, fire alarm systems, etc. \nwill be minimum one-hour fire rated.  \nDrive-rated cables will be used from VFD’s to the motors when they are \nseparated by more than 10m of cable length from the VFD’s.\nLighting\nThe lighting system will be designed to provide for the functional \nrequirements of the installation. The Illuminating Engineering Society of \nNorth America (IESNA) standards and the University of Alberta lighting \ndesign guide will be the key references. Established standards and \nparameters for a residential facility will be used for the design as they \napply to specific areas; however these standards and parameters may \nbe altered to achieve Green Globes certification. Energy consumption \nconsiderations and lighting levels will be carefully weighed with the \nbenefits of achieving a Green Globes certification.\nThe lighting system for the Lister 5 Residence will be designed to \nprovide integration of numerous lighting techniques to provide vibrant \nand attractive atmosphere that is both inviting and engaging for the \npeople within the space. It is the intent to provide layered lighting \nwithin public circulation and gathering areas that will enhance the \nbuilding’s profile on campus. It will both augment and add to the \narchitectural elements of the space in providing a visually stimulating \nenvironment that is comfortable and welcoming. It is the intention that \nthe design will integrate the various aspects of the lighting system with \nthe building’s space functions, mechanical systems, and architectural \nelements. Integration of natural light captured by the building will take \non a key role in achieving desired illumination.\n5.\n0 \nEL\nEC\nTR\nIC\nA\nL\nEXAMPLE OF LIGHTING PRECEDENCE\nLister 5\nDesign Development Report\n102\nThe basis of design will include LED luminaires within the suites and \nfluorescent lighting in all other areas throughout the facility.\nLighting Control System\nAll building lighting will be controlled to decrease energy use, allow \nflexibility, and to meet the requirements of the University of Alberta. The \nlighting control system will be a line voltage system with a combination \nof local and automatic controls that will interface with the Building \nAutomation System. Controls will include: \n1. Occupancy sensors will be provided in all public areas including \ncorridors, social spaces, washrooms, and similar spaces.\n2. Storage rooms and utility rooms to be complete with local on/off \ncombination occupancy sensor switch. \n3. Suites: Lighting control within suites to be a combination switch/\nsensor with 'vacancy' setting; manual on, auto off.\n4. Central time clock control. All general building lighting, with the \nexception of suites and low-usage areas will be controlled using a \ncentral time clock via the BMS system. \n5. Daylight sensors will be considered for the perimeter spaces, \nrecreation room, fitness room, upper floor corridors and social \nspaces. This daylight control will either shut off the nearest fixture \nto the windows or dim the luminaires in these areas.\nThe control system is being provided to meet the requirements of the \nGreen Globes program and intended to not only increase user comfort \nand ease of maintenance, but to reduce the energy usage in the building. \nFire Alarm System\nThe fire alarm system will be a single-stage, annunciated, class A-wired \nand electrically supervised system. Zoning of the fire alarm system will \nbe based on smoke zone subdivision. System devices will be of the \naddressable type and will consist of manual pull station, products-of-\ncombustion detectors, thermal detectors, and sprinkler flow valves.\nFire alarm sounding devices will be of the audible and visual (strobe) type \nin compliance with the latest Alberta Barrier-Free Code requirements. \nMain Fire Alarm Control Panel will be located in the Main \nTelecommunication Room; Main Fire Alarm Annunciator Panel will be \nlocated at the main south entrance.\nNo fire phones will be provided.\n5.\n0 \nEL\nEC\nTR\nIC\nA\nL\nIn-suite notification devices will be a speaker/strobe combination device \ncapable of broadcasting a mass notification message; note that suite \nsignaling will include a speaker circuit dedicated to the suites (per floor) \nand a separate speaker circuit (per floor) dedicated to common areas.\nLocal smoke alarms will be used in all suites.\nThe fire alarm system will also be interconnected into the campus wide \nFM Net system and Mass Notification System.\nThe network connection will be at the FACP, not the annunciator. The \nFAAP will be a standard transponder interface annunciator only. It will \nrequire a dedicated 120V circuit, and will consist of an 8-line display, \nremote microphone, control switches for paging and bypasses, and a \nspare tub for mounting a graphic. FACP will include the same functionality \n(display, microphone, switches, graphic, etc.).\nLOW TENSION SYSTEMS\nThis section of the report discusses the various low tension and security \nsystems that are envisioned to be installed in the Lister 5 Residence.\nSecurity Systems\nSecurity design discussions to date have been captured below but will \nalso require further review after a CPTED review is completed.  \nAccess Control System\nAt the present, the project will allow for the installation of conduit and \ncabling system complete with all necessary power supplies. Devices and \nhead-end equipment will be provided by the University of Alberta.\nCard access control will be provided at the following locations:\n• Mackenzie hall entrance\n• Exterior recycling entrance\n• East entrance\n• Interior passages into east wing on main floor x 2\n• Elevators\n• All perimeter doors complete with door contacts for monitoring to \nbe confirmed w ACS.\nCCTV System \nCamera locations will be provided complete w conduit and cabling to the \nnearest communication room.

Acoustic treatment will be \nrequired in  areas such as the multipurpose rooms, lounges and living \nspace to ensure adequately low sound levels.  High background noise \nlevels adversely affect speech intelligibility for the students, resulting in \nreduced learning capacity.  \nThe high background noise levels can also be a source of fatigue in \ncertain cases for prolonged exposures, such as that experienced by \nthe teaching staff dedicated to specific rooms or areas for extended \nperiods.  A common source of high background sound levels is due \nto the mechanical systems, if not designed or accounted for properly.  \nMechanical noise sources typically take the form of (i) noise from the \nHVAC system supply and return ducts, most notably via the supply \ndiffusers and return air openings, (ii) HVAC system terminal and \nconditioning units, particularly those with fans or blowers  such as \nhorizontal fan coil units, and (iii) sound transmission via architectural \nboundaries of rooms or areas housing mechanical systems common or \nnoise sensitive spaces, including the roof boundary for exterior rooftop \nequipment. These aspects are being reviewed to ensure adequately low \nsound levels appropriate for the intended uses  proposed for the Lister \nHall project.    \nNoise-sensitive spaces in the building that need to be protected from \nnoise generated in other areas have also been identified through the \ndesign development  process. Acoustic wall types have been identified \nfor all areas that  require sound isolation. These spaces include \nground floor spaces such as the multipurpose rooms, study rooms and \nwashrooms.  For the upper floors, the bedrooms, study rooms, and \nbathrooms require specific assemblies to mitigate noise transfer. Duct \nshafts and pipe shafts have also been included in this review. Acoustical \nratings will meet the minimum STC ratings as identified in the Alberta \nbuilding code and will be increased in sensitive areas as required to \nprovide acoustic performance of these spaces.\nThe detailed evaluation of acoustic requirements will continue into the \nConstruction Documentation Phase.\nLister 5\nDesign Development Report\n118\n7.0 CIVIL DESIGN\n7.\n0 \nC\nIV\nIL\n7.\n0 \nC\nIV\nIL\nLister 5\nDesign Development Report\n119\nSITE GRADING\nSchematic Design Summary\nThe proposed location of the new Lister 5 student residence is south \nof the Henday and Mackenzie Tower student residences, over most of \nthe existing south parking lot and a portion of the existing outdoor rink. \nSeveral existing underground utilities are in conflict with the proposed \nbuilding location.\nRunoff water from rain fall and melting snow will be designed to flow \naway from the building’s perimeter.  Minimal disruption of the existing \nsite was also a goal in order to reduce required construction efforts which \nconserves resources and aids in reducing the project’s environmental \nimpact.\nThe grading design is going to be framed primarily by the proposed \nbuilding floor elevation(s) and the following factors:\n• The existing site which slopes gradually east to west and from south \nto north at varying degrees\n• Grades that slope more dramatically toward Mackenzie Hall north \nof the rink\n• Creating synergies between necessary grading and vegetative and \nlandscape restorations\n• Where possible, take advantage of ex. ground contours to design \ngreater indoor ceiling heights \nDesign Development Update\nThe Lister 5 floor elevations which dictated many of the outdoor grade \nrelationships were defined though cooperative consultation with the \ndesign and construction teams. Door access points to the building \nperimeter, ramp and accessibility limitations also required careful \nconsideration to determine finished floor elevations. \nThese factors resulted in an achievable building elevation lower than \nexisting grade around most of the building perimeter.  Alternate means \nof raising the finished floor elevations are being evaluated and will be \nfinalized during detailing of the construction documents.\nWith the current floor design elevations, in order to maintain positive \ndrainage from the foundations, a swale or low area had to be designed \nthat is adequately offset from the building perimeter before grade can \ntransition back up to meet existing ground around it.  Though vegetation \nthat could utilize the additional runoff water may be selected and \nlocated within these depressions, drainage infrastructure tied into the \nunderground storm system will be necessary to relieve excess runoff \naccumulations.\nWhere possible existing mature trees have been protected from grade \nchanges that would affect root systems.  These areas coincide with \ndesired connection points for outdoor access from the building and are \nbeing incorporated into the next stage of design.\nSITE SERVICING\nSchematic Design Summary\nProposed re-routing options around the Lister 5 footprint were offered \nat schematic design stage and evaluated by University Utility Services.  \nThe costs and benefits were weighed accounting for minimized site \ndisruption, avoiding removal or damage to existing trees, service \nconstruction feasibility & schedule, and avoiding utility service \ninterruptions to existing University buildings and facility operations.   \nBelow is a summary:\nStorm System\n• Currently serviced by an ex. 450mm storm connection to a 1225mm \nstorm main along 117 Street\n• An existing 450mm storm service main runs east-west underneath \nthe south portion of proposed building, slopes at less than 1% and \nsupports drainage areas from the north, east and south\n• Multiple additional catch basin leads will also need to re-routed\n• Re-routing the storm around the east end of the building, south \nthen again west was examined\nSanitary System\n• Existing junction manhole & associated inlet and outlet pipes located \nunder the east end of the proposed building require re-routing\n• Reconnection to a new manhole installed on the ex. sanitary main \neast of the building suggested\n• Pipe elevations to be examined for re-routing feasibility\n• Re-use of ex. 375mm sanitary pipe for building sanitary connection \nsuggested\nDomestic and Fire Water System\n• The existing 150mm water line and the ex. fire hydrant being fed fall \nbeneath proposed building\n• Relocation of the existing hydrant west of proposed building \nsuggested  \n• Water service for the proposed development will come from the \nexisting University utility corridor tunnel network\n• Tunnel connection location from east face of building to ex. N/S \nutility corridor suggested\n• Existing hydrant and water piping are under University jurisdiction\n• Domestic and fire water service routing and sizing is in design\nDesign Development Update\nUtility Corridor Connection\nThe utility corridor connection from the east face of Lister 5 to the \nexisting N/S utility corridor to be utilized for domestic water, fire water \nand other building services is currently in design along with the service \npiping that it will house.\nThe utility corridor connection is currently designed with a 5% slope up \nfrom east to west.  This will result in the floor of the E/W wing of Lister 5 \nbeing approximately 3m higher than the corridor floor at the connection \npoint between the two structures.  \nAn access will be required in the Lister 5 mechanical room.  University \nUtility Services has advised that a ship’s ladder will be sufficient to \nprovide access to the new tunnel connection.  This design is evolving with \ncoordination between Architecture, Civil, and Structural consultants.\nIt is anticipated that approximately 0.6m of ground cover over the top of \nthe utility corridor will remain at the Lister 5 connection point.  Survey \ninformation being collected will determine the exact extent of ground \ncover remaining and impacts to the existing mature trees in this area.\nStorm System\nA rationalized re-routing strategy has been devised to maximize utilization \nof the exiting storm infrastructure and integrate any additional drainage \nelements deemed necessary.  This will require installation of three new \nmanholes just north of the E/W wing connected through 450mm storm \npiping.  Between the two eastern-most manholes a 450mm fusion \nwelded HDPE pipe has been designed to run beneath the N/S wing of \nthe proposed building.\nThe joint-less nature of fusion welded piping provides for very low \nrisk of pipe leakage or cracking failure.  Due to smooth inner surface \nand lack of connection seams it also offers the most reliable long-term \nserviceability.  The fact that storm piping is under no pressure and will \nbe dry 99% of the time should provide a level of added comfort. 7.\n0 \nC\nIV\nIL\n7.\n0 \nC\nIV\nIL\nLister 5\nDesign Development Report\n120\nAs stated in the Site Grading section, depressed areas around the \nbuilding perimeter will require supplemental drainage infrastructure \nto relieve excess runoff accumulations.  Through a combination of area \ndrains for smaller drainage basins and catch basins for larger basins, \nadequate drainage can be achieved that can work with anticipated \noutdoor activities, use & enjoyment of these spaces by students.\nSanitary System\nRe-routing of the existing sanitary system as described at Design \nDevelopment has been verified as acceptable and feasible. A new \njunction manhole will be require installation on the E/W leg of the \nexisting sanitary that runs beneath the existing N/S utility corridor.\nFrom the north, the proposed sanitary pipe from the existing north \nsanitary manhole will skirt both Henday and existing mature trees near \nthe south end of Henday Hall.  However we are confident much of the \ntree’s root systems may be avoided. From the south a manhole will need \nto be installed on the existing sanitary line and run NE.  The mature trees \neast of the building may be more significantly impacted by this piping.  \nExact tree location and elevations are being surveyed so precise impacts \nmay be predicted.  \nDue to the proposed utility corridor connection from the east face of \nLister 5 to the existing N/S utility corridor, re-use of ex. sanitary piping \nfor the building sanitary connection will be unlikely.  Rather, a new \n200mm or 250mm sanitary connection to the east junction manhole \nwill be necessary.\nDomestic & Fire Water System\nDomestic and fire water service for the proposed building will be sourced \nfrom the new utility corridor connection at the east end of Lister 5.  Size \nof each of these services is currently in design.\nRelocation of the ex. fire hydrant and associated 150mm water piping to \nthe SW end of Lister 5 is in design.  This location will be within 45m of \nthe building sprinkler system fire department connection.  The existing \nhydrant’s fitness for re-use will need to be verified prior to re-location.  \nIf found to be in poor condition, a new hydrant will be required.\nThe existing water service valve is currently unknown and attempts are \nbeing made by University Utility Services to locate it.  If unsuccessful a \nnew valve will need to be cut into the existing water piping to allow for \nthe new hydrant connection.  A specific hydrant shut off valve will not be \nnecessary if this is the case.7.\n0 \nC\nIV\nIL\n7.\n0 \nC\nIV\nIL\nLister 5\nDesign Development Report\n121\n7.\n0 \nC\nIV\nIL\n7.\n0 \nC\nIV\nIL\nLister 5\nDesign Development Report\n122\n8.0 LANDSCAPE\n8.\n0 \nLA\nN\nD\nSC\nA\nP\nE\n8.\n0 \nLA\nN\nD\nSC\nA\nP\nE\nLister 5\nDesign Development Report\n123\n8.\n0 \nLA\nN\nD\nSC\nA\nP\nE\nExisting Development Area\nThe proposed site is located south of the existing Lister Complex \nin a landscaped area that currently contains mature trees, areas of \nestablished sod, an outdoor beach volleyball court, an outdoor ice rink \nwith shack and asphalt trails traversing the site. On the south side of the \nlandscaped site area is an asphalt parking lot that currently serves the \nLister Complex students. \nLandscape, Grading and Civil Servicing Design Goals\nThe surrounding area and neighbourhood is comprised of a variety of \ntree species that are mature and large in scale. The relative distance \nbetween the construction zone and existing mature trees should allow \nmany of the existing trees to remain undisturbed. A project design \npriority is to maintain and protect as many of the existing trees as \nfall and melting snow will be diverted away from the building’s perimeter \nand will be captured and removed from the site utilizing as much of the \nexisting storm piping infrastructure as possible. \nSimilarly, underground sanitary and water infrastructure have been \nexamined to determine the best options for re-routing. Once again, of \nprimary importance was minimizing site disruption, damage to existing \ntrees in conjunction with uninterrupted utility service from existing \nUniversity buildings and facility operations.\nLandscape Design\nIntroduction\nThe proposed landscape plan focuses on the health and well-being \nof the students as well as connectivity through and across the site. \nLandscape development will be directed towards the south side of \nthe building to take advantage of solar exposure while the northern \ncourtyard area will be restored to provide flexible green space. Steps \nwill be taken to minimize disturbance to existing trees and any loss will \nbe mitigated through extensive planting along the southern facade. This \nnew planting will provide visual interest, both from views to the building \nfrom the outside and from the inside of the building looking out. The \nfinal selection of landscape materials will be based on colour, form, \ntexture and sustainability, during all the seasons of the year.\nConnectivity\nThe sitting of the building will disrupt a major east-west connection \nbetween the residential area across 117th Street and the LRT stop at \nHealth Services Centre. The landscape plan responds to this by creating \na safe and inviting streetscape along the internal road south of the \nbuilding. A wide walkway with street trees, shrubs and perennials, \nvegetated boulevard, lighting and seating is proposed to accommodate \nboth neighbouring residents and students. The east exit of the building \nwill also tie into this walkway to provide access to the campus and LRT.\nThe building exits on the north and east sides of the building will tie into \nthe existing campus walkway system to provide connections to Lister \nCentre and the main campus. Improvements to the internal roadway \nsuch as a different surface treatment, raised pedestrian crossing and a \ncurb extension will be explored in order to enhance the connection to \nthe existing green space in Lister Hall Field located to the south.\npossible and devise creative alternatives that assist in this pursuit. \nApproximately 19 trees are required to be removed, almost all of which \nare large spruce. The removal of these trees will be mitigated through \nthe planting of new 45 trees.\nThe existing site slopes gradually east to west and only slightly south \nto north until beyond the outdoor rink where the slope drops off \nmore dramatically toward Mackenzie Hall. These grade differences \npose challenges as well as opportunities. By taking advantage of the \nnatural grade site disruption can be minimized. This reduces required \nconstruction efforts which conserves resources and aids in reducing the \nproject’s environmental impact. \nAs important will be developing synergies between grading and function \nto ensure safety, security, maintainability and usability of all outdoor \nspaces and transitions to building access points.

This space provides areas to \nsit, study, relax, congregate and enjoy the outdoors. Trees are provided \naround the perimeter as well as within the plaza to offer a combination \nof sun and shade. Seating elements will consist of both benches as well \nas movable tables and chairs. Additional seating will be provided along \nthe walkways. Landscape lighting will be provided throughout the plaza \nand walkways to help create safe and inviting spaces to be enjoyed year-\nround.\nThe area between the new building, Mackenzie Hall and Henday Hall \nwill be remediated into a large open grass area that can provide flexible \nspace for both passive and active recreation. A small sculpture garden is \nproposed adjacent to the building next to the upper lounge to provide \nvisual interest throughout the year.\nBike racks are located near the east entrance providing quick access to \nthe campus and city-wide trail network.\nThe residential suites will require privacy screening to separate ground \nlevel activities and the public from the student’s personal activities \nand required privacy. The concept is to create a psychological barrier \nbetween the public and private spaces as opposed to providing a \ncomplete physical barrier. To complement the architectural forms, the \nprivacy screens are proposed in an angular non-linear pattern. The \nscreen fences are not a consistent height, but rather transition from \nlow walls to high walls to again complement the architectural forms \nthrough strong angular lines. Several materials have been explored and \na vinyl fencing was selected to complement the facade treatment and \nto be in line with the budget. The Faculty apartments will have the same \ntreatment, but include a space for an exterior yard area to allow the \nresident of these units the opportunity to have some exterior personal \nspace. \nPlanting \nNew plantings will primarily focus on the residence areas of the ground \nlevel of the new building as well as the communal plazas and seating \nareas.

Please circle the descriptions below that best portrays you:\n2. If you chose “Other” above, please let us know about yourself\nNone\n3. Please check the age category that you are in.\n1 \nAttachment 2\n4. How did you hear about this open house?\n5. Did the material that was presented help you understand what the Lister 5 and East\nCampus Village 9 student housing projects are?\n6. Did the material that was presented help you understand the proposed preliminary\ndesign for Lister 5 and East Campus Village 9?\n2 \nThe following questions relate specifically to the Lister 5 student housing project: \n7. Please comment on your impressions regarding Board #4 and the preliminary\ndesign for Lister 5:\n• Design is okay.\n• Appreciate the lower height and \"bowtie\" design. Appreciate the breaking up\nof the massing of the long walls with glassed areas looking outside.\n• The open space is appreciated and the large window design. It is important\nthat the kitchen be equipped with a stove and a microwave as to encourage\nmore healthy cooking habits and community building.\n• This design is better than another tall tower. Given that there is a condo\nbuilding on 87th Ave and 117 St and there will be another apartment building\ngoing up on that corner, the University should be talking to the City to\nimprove the pedestrian crossing at this corner. Students will be crossing at\nthis intersection and travelling by bike to the U and improved safety at this\ncrossing is important.\n• We like the proposed design: it is not too tall, the proposed color tone will go\nwith Mary Schaffer Hall when viewed from a distance, the sidewalk on south\nside provides access to the LRT and the ground front windows provide \"eyes\non the street\" for safety.\n• I like the low-rise, as long as there is preserved paved path to the LRT.\n8. Please provide comments on the design principles as applied to the proposed\ndesign on Boards #5 and #6:\n• Good application of design principles, like the active street level. Color shown\non boards is too light - too grey - snow/winter color prefer red ? or bright\ncolored panels to brighten things up in the winter\n• Very appealing visually.\n• Pedestrian principles/cycling principles - this is a very busy area of campus.\nThe addition of another residence will require the University to work with the\nCity of Edmonton to improve traffic flow and crossings at busy intersections\n(at 87th Ave and 117 St). This includes providing parking services staff to be\n\"on-site\" and actively managing traffic flow into the U particularly when there\nare one or more large activities going on at the Butterdome and SUB Mall.\nThis should include barriers around parking areas to stop cars from short\ncutting and parking in \"No Parking\" areas of neighbouring areas, particularly\nWindsor Park.\n• Elevations look good.\n• I like the design with the open social spaces and the kitchen on the main\nfloor.\n9. Please provide any further comments about the Lister 5 student housing project:\n• We are concerned about noise, dust, vibrations and heavy trucks during\nthe lengthy construction period. We need good liaison between university,\nconstruction company and neighborhood. May also be concern for\npatients and employees at Cross Cancer Institute.\n• I'm very pleased there will be a walkway east to west from/to Health\nSciences Station and the Windsor Park Community.\n• The University also needs to consider that students staying in residence\ndo have cars and they have friends and family who visit them. Students\nwith cars, who live in residence, should be encouraged to buy a parking\npass at the University, so they have a place to park their cars. They\nshould also be informed about where their guests can and cannot park\nand given detailed information about the parking restrictions in Windsor\nPark and the consequences of parking there illegally.\n• If executed as proposed, it will look good. It is essential to maintain easy\naccess from 117 St to the LRT as proposed. We realize that reducing\n3 \nparking is likely to cause additional illegal parking on neighborhood streets \nso the university should ensure that students with cars park on campus. \n• I like the washroom design where the showers and toilets are separated\non each half, because I think it's more hygienic.\nThe following questions relate specifically to the East Campus Village 9 student \nhousing project: \n10. Please comment on your impressions regarding Board #8 and the preliminary\ndesign for East Campus Village 9:\n• Good - doesn't affect us directly.\n• The social space is a tremendous factor in encouraging students to\nappreciate the community spirit.\n• Please consider tying East Campus Village into utili ?\n• It looks good but rent for the 6 bedroom units needs to be cheap enough to\njustify having to live with so many people.\n11. Please provide comments on the design principles and architectural concepts on\nBoards #9 and #10:\n• I think it's important that the north/south walkways in East Campus be\nimproved to help to increase movement between the buildings. There also\nneeds to be improvements to night time lighting and safety features to make\nit fell less scary.\n12. Please provide any further comments about the East Campus Village 9 student\nhousing project:\n• Very approving of the 6-unit housing think it will be great for campus\ncommunity. Nice design as well.\n• I think additional student consultation needs to be done, an open house has\nnever been held for students living in East Campus Village area who will be\nmost affected by this project. Lister had an open for their project and it was\nvery successful. We deserve the same style of consultation. The existing\nfurniture in residence is very low quality, it's important that the units are\nfurnished with high quality furniture. This includes things like sturdy tables\nand comfortable couches and chairs.\n• The bedroom doors need to be designed with deadbolt or similar style doors\nthat make it impossible to lock your keys inside the bedroom. Current doors\nare designed so this is possible and it means that students are constantly\nlocking their keys in their rooms. Full sized reliable fridges and freezers are\nvery important. Internet access in each room should be available through an\nEthernet connection as well as UWS because UWS is unreliable and doesn't\nwork with devices like game consoles. It's important that social spaces are\nfurnished adequately to encourage use, build community and reduce social\nisolation. Details like ventilation and lighting are important, current residences\ncan be dark and not comfortably ventilated requiring the student to buy their\nown fan and lights. It's very important that each room has a doorbell,\nbecause with multi-floor apartments it will be impossible to hear someone\nknocking at the front door if you are in your bedroom. This is key to building\ncommunity as well as ensuring staff can make it known when they are\nentering the unit.\"\n4 \nItem No. 5 \nGFC FACILITIES DEVELOPMENT COMMITTEE  \nFor the Meeting of June 23, 2016 \n OUTLINE OF ISSUE \nAgenda Title: East Campus Village 9:  Design Development Report  \nItem  \nAction Requested Approval Recommendation  Discussion/Advice  Information \nProposed by Doug Dawson, Associate Vice-President, Ancillary Services; Pat Jansen, \nAssociate Vice-President, Planning and Project Delivery \nPresenter Geoff Rode, Director of Operations, Ancillary Services, Sarah \nWolgemuth, Assistant Dean of Students, Residence Life; Kelly Hopkin, \nManager Campus Architecture, Facilities and Operations \nSubject East Campus Village 9 – Design Development Report  \nDetails \nResponsibility Vice-President (Facilities and Operations)  \nThe Purpose of the Proposal is \n(please be specific) \nThe proposed new student housing residence will feature individual, self-\ncontained apartments in (32) six-bedroom and (27) four-bedroom \nconfigurations designed to be attractive to international, rural and upper \nyear graduate students.

 East Campus Village 9 Student Housing \nDesign Development Report \n  DESIGN DEVELOPMENT REPORT – JUNE 9, 2016   \n3 \nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY  \nBackground \nIn November of 2015 the University of Alberta issued an open RFPQ to select a Design \nBuild Team to design and build a new 300 bed residence in East Campus Village to be \ncompleted in July of 2018 with a Budget of $26 million dollars. Three separate Design Build \nTeams were selected to submit schematic designs and fixed design and construction costs \nbased on a Statement of Requirements provided by the University. After careful \nconsideration of the designs and accompanying costs the Design Build Team led by Stuart \nOlson Construction and Hodgson Schilf Architects was awarded the project in February \n2016. \nThe Design Build Team, including Contractor, Architectural, Structural, Mechanical, \nElectrical, Civil and Landscape have been working together with the University of Alberta \nsince March, 2016 to finalize the project design and prepare this Design Development \nReport which builds upon the earlier submitted work and summarizes the development of \nthe design for the East Campus Village 9 Student Housing project.  \n          Vision and Objectives \nThe residences in East Campus Village have been intentionally designed to each support \nspecific student experiences and demographics, contributing to an overall culture within the \nneighbourhood of a mature and connected community. The goal and objective in \nconstructing ECV9 is to increase capacity to offer upper year undergraduate students a \nplace to transition to after living in the University’s dormitory style residences. The ECV9 \nStudent Housing project will be designed to embody the ideals laid out in the University of \nAlberta’s Strategy for Residences 2015-2020 document and respond to the University’s \noverall vision that properly designed and operated student housing contributes positively to \nstudent success and learning outcomes and features prominently in a student’s lasting \nimpression of their time at university.  \nECV9 will be a co-ed student residence that will accommodate upper year undergraduate \nstudents. The facility is to be a welcoming, living-learning community that will incorporate \nresidential suites with social and multi-function spaces including study areas and other \nprogrammable space designed to create a positive student experience and contribute to \nstudent success. The design is to conform to both the University of Alberta Sector 8 Long \nRange Development Plan and the University of Alberta Design Guidelines for Infill \nDevelopment – Garneau. \nThe development will include 300 beds in a combination of 4 bedroom and 6 bedroom \napartment style housing in a supportive living/learning environment and will incorporate the \nmost current thinking related to optimizing the student experience of engagement, \nachievement and well-being. \nSite \nThe parcel of land allocated for the ECV9 Student Housing project is located in East Campus \nVillage in Sector 8 in the northeast quadrant of the main campus and is bounded by 90 th Ave to \nthe north, 89th Ave to the south, 111th Street to the west and a future pedestrian pathway to the \neast. The site is currently occupied by six individual houses of varying states of poor condition \nwhich will be removed to allow for new construction. The entire parcel of land is approximately \n5,215 m2 in area. The site topography slopes 2.5 meters in the north/south direction from 89th Ave \ndown to 90th Ave resulting in both a challenge and opportunity in the building design. The project \naims to minimize development impact, respect the current siting context and maintain significant \nopen spaces on the site. \nThe building design concept is an “E” shaped building with the main building façade and entrance \nfacing 111th Street (Urban Boulevard) and the wings facing 89th and 90th Avenues and two internal \ncourtyards created by the building configuration. The design concept responds to the unique \nurban characteristics of the surrounding 89/90th Ave and 111th Street as well as the network of \nopen spaces pathways and nodes. All wings of the building are set back from the street to align \nwith the existing houses and other Student Housing buildings. The massing of the building \ntransitions in scale from 5 storeys along 111th Street to 4 storeys for the “wings” fronting 89th and \n90th Avenues to respect the scale of the existing community.  \nProcess and Consultation \nThe Design Build process resulted in the selection of the Schematic Design that most closely met \nthe vision and objectives of the University for the ECV9 project while being consistent with the \nUniversity’s planning documents including the Sector Plan 8 Long range Development Plan \n(March 28, 2013) and Design Guidelines for infill Development – Garneau (December 14, 2007). \nUpon appointment of the Design Build Team a series of ongoing meetings with the Stakeholders \ntook place to review the Schematic Design and to encourage exchange of discussions and ideas. \n  East Campus Village 9 Student Housing \nDesign Development Report \n  DESIGN DEVELOPMENT REPORT – JUNE 9, 2016   \n4 \nInput from the U of A and Student participants resulted in adjustments to the functional program to \npositively impact the design. Further meetings with the Design team and the University Architect’s \nOffice resulted in revisions to the exterior massing and materiality to better address the Design \nGuidelines for infill Development-Garneau and Sector 8 goals.  \nThrough its Community Relations the University of Alberta works with residents in its neighbouring \ncommunities to ensure the community consultation process is respectful, transparent, and also \nconsistent with consultation protocol articulated in Appendix 18 of the Sector Plan 8 Long Range \nDevelopment Plan (LRDP) while meeting the university’s primary goal of achieving its academic \nvision. Two open house events had been organized for the ECV9 project. Open House #1 took \nplace on February 25, 2016 and Open House 2 on May 17, 2016.   Feedback comments from \nboth open houses have been incorporated into the Design Development package. \nDesign Solution \nThe design solution that is fully articulated throughout this report has been developed by an \nintegrated team in a collaborative process. The proposed solution meets all of the requirements of \nthe functional program as well the following qualitative aspects: \n Support the experience of community \n Interactive learning in small peer groups \n Opportunities to invite the public in \n Integration of recreation, leisure and student services as well as neighbouring resources \nand amenities \nProject Overview \nStatistics \nThe ECV9 Housing Project will provide 300 bed spaces in a combination of 4 bedroom and \n6 bedroom suites. A total of four barrier free units are provided throughout the \ndevelopment. \nThe overall development consists of one building with a total gross floor area of 10,554 m2. \nThe building varies from 4 storeys to 5 storeys in building height.  \nThe table below identifies the mix of suites within the building.

Three options for site design and \nmassing were offered and the “C” or “E” shaped option with the main entrance from 111th \nStreet was chosen for the following reasons: \n Consistent with design guidelines. \n Split of main floor can provide distinct spaces adjacent to pedestrian paths. \n The open courtyard is inclusive of the adjacent buildings and the pedestrian path. \n Tiered building to scale of adjacent buildings. \nA follow up open house meeting was held on May 17, 2016 at which time the current \ndesign proposal was presented. The presentation boards restated the Design Principles for \nGarneau Infill and the Sector 8 Long Range Development Plan, March 2013. Design \nprinciples relating to the neighbourhood include: \n Maintaining the scale and general character of the existing neighbourhood and \ncompatibility with the neighbouring community of Garneau. \n Encouraging residents of student housing to access required services in the \nsurrounding neighbourhood community. \n Planning and developing Sector 8 with adjacent Sector 7. \nThe design principals related to proposed development include: \n Producing a high quality living environment for all residents. \n Designing housing for flexibility and adaptation. \n Incorporating into the design a variety of facilities including community use spaces. \n Determining building heights and setbacks using neighbourhood specific guideline \nreferences. Community feedback for the design was very positive. \nThe design presented identified challenges and opportunities. Opportunities identified with \nthe current design include: \n Sustainable design targeting Green Globes standards. \n Continue to develop east Campus Village into a vibrant, student-focused \nneighbourhood walkable to campus and amenities. \n Provide student friendly interior design, welcoming entrances, social spaces and \nenhanced landscaping connecting to Commons and bicycle paths. \n Provide large accessible spaces. \nThe overall response to the proposal was very positive. \n Design Committee Meetings \nA total of three meetings took place in March 2016, during the design development phase.  \nParticipants in the Design Committee included representatives from Ancillary Services, \nStudent Representatives, Office of the University Architect, the Project Management Office, \nand the Design Build Team. \nThe purpose of the meetings was to review design and design progress in detail and to get \ninput, feedback and decisions from all stakeholders. The following recommendations \nresulted from these meetings: \n Delete one 4 Bedroom Suite adjacent to the Main Floor Lobby and replace with \nmeeting /collaborative study Huddle Rooms. \n Increase the area of Main Lobby space by extending the floor plate to align with \nthe building overhang of the second floor above. \n Consolidate the common Laundry Rooms on the Upper two floors in lieu of \nsmaller ones on each floor. \n Increase the Social Lounges on each floor by eliminating the indentation in the \nbuilding plans. \n Increase storage space in the suites wherever possible \n Develop the interior concept for the common social spaces in an industrial/studio \natmosphere. \n Students Representatives Meetings \nStudent representatives were invited to the three Design Committee Meeting/presentation \nworkshops in March 2016 to review options for the proposed suite layouts and \nsocial/common space design. The feedback from these meetings resulted in minor \nrevisions of the preferred suite layouts as well as confirmation of the requirements for the \nsocial/common spaces. \nU of A- Office of the University Architect Design Meetings \nA total of two meetings were held between the Office of the University Architect and the \nDesign Build Architect to review and discuss opportunities for massing and materiality \nrevisions to the design for better conformance to the intent of the Garneau Infill Guidelines \nThis resulted in a design that breaks the massing to give the appearance of a number of \nbuildings abutting each other as opposed to one large homogenous building. This was \nachieved by adjustments and detail to the roof details, materiality changes and the \nintroduction of vertical elements to break the horizontality of the massing. The treatment of \nthe 111th Street entrance façade as a separate more modern vocabulary reinforces the \nguiding principal of “Transcending the present: traditional and modern.” \n  East Campus Village 9 Student Housing \nDesign Development Report \n  DESIGN DEVELOPMENT REPORT – JUNE 9, 2016   \n8 \n U of A- Utilities Meetings \nA Meeting with Utilities was held to finalize and coordinate mechanical and electrical site \nservicing. \nU of A – Landscape Meeting \nA meeting and site visit was conducted with Tom McLean and the Landscape Architect to \ndetermine which existing trees on site were to be preserved. \n Building Code/ Life Safety Meeting \nA meeting was held with the Inspections Group to review the preliminary building code \nanalysis. The overall Building Classification, size, height and occupancy were confirmed. It \nwas agreed to separate the main floor assembly uses from the residential by a 1 hour \nmajor occupancy separation. No fire separations are required between the main floor lobby \nsocial lounge and other assembly uses. Social lounges on floors 2 to 5 are allowed to be \nopen to the elevator/ corridor. Options for separation of the 3 storey wings and the existing \nstrategy of the 2 level suites is under review. \n Consultant Coordination Meetings \nIn addition to the Design Committee meetings bi-weekly consultant coordination meetings \nwere held at the Prime Consultant’s office. The purpose of the meetings was to provide \ndetailed coordination of the various Architectural and Engineering disciplines. \n  East Campus Village 9 Student Housing \nDesign Development Report \n  DESIGN DEVELOPMENT REPORT – JUNE 9, 2016   \n9 \n3.0     PROGRAM \nThe ECV 9 Program documents and Statement of Requirements were provided to the \ndesign build team as the basis for further planning and design. ECV9 will be a co-ed \nstudent residence that will accommodate upper year undergraduate students. The facility is \nto be a welcoming, living-learning community that will incorporate residential suites with \nsocial and multi-function spaces including study areas and other programmable space \ndesigned to create a positive student experience and contribute to student success. The \ndesign is to conform to both the University of Alberta Sector 8 Long Range Development \nPlan and the University of Alberta Design Guidelines for Infill Development –Garneau. \nThe development will include 300 beds in a combination of 4 bedroom and 6 bedroom \napartment style housing in a supportive living/learning environment and will incorporate the \nmost current thinking related to optimizing the student experience of engagement, \nachievement and well-being. \nThe design build submission included a comparison chart of the designed program areas \nversus the program areas provided in the RFPQ document. During the design development \nphase a number of space programming parameters were further analysed and discussed \nwith representatives of the U of A, students and the entire project team. The resulting \nmodifications and adjustments have been incorporated into the design development as \nfollows; \n Delete one 4 Bedroom Suite adjacent to the Main Floor Lobby and replace with \nmeeting /collaborative study Huddle Rooms. \n Increase the area of Main Lobby space by extending the floor plate to align with \nthe building overhang of the second floor above. \n Consolidate the common Laundry Rooms on the Upper two floors in lieu of \nsmaller ones on each floor. \n Increase the Social Lounges on each floor by eliminating the indentation in the \nbuilding plans. \n Revise the mix of 6 Bedroom and 4 Bedroom Suites as a result of building re-\nmassing and relocating 8 bedrooms from the basement level to upper levels. \n Increase the size of the main mechanical room, main electrical room and data \nrooms to accommodate actual layouts. \n Add 2 washrooms to the Fitness Facility and Main Floor Public Lobby. \nIn addition to meeting the quantitative parameters of the Program the success of the project \nalso requires meeting the following qualitative aspects: \n Support the experience of community \n Interactive learning in small peer groups \n

Development Report \n  DESIGN DEVELOPMENT REPORT – JUNE 9, 2016   \n15 \nOverall Site Planning Concept \nThe parcel of land allocated for the ECV 9 Student Housing project is located in East \nCampus Village in Sector 8 in the northeast quadrant of the main campus and is bounded \nby 90th Ave to the north, 89th Ave to the south, 111th Street to the west and a future \npedestrian pathway to the east. The site is currently occupied by six individual houses \nwhich will be removed to allow for new construction. The entire parcel of land is \napproximately 5,215m2 in area. The site topography slopes 2.5 meters in the north/south \ndirection from 89th Ave down to 90th Ave resulting in both a challenge and opportunity in the \nbuilding design. \nThe building design concept is an “E” shaped building with the main building façade and \nentrance facing 111th Street (Urban Boulevard) and the wings facing 89th and 90th Avenues \nand two internal courtyards created by the building configuration. The design concept \nresponds to the unique urban characteristics of the surrounding 89/90th Ave and 111th \nStreet as well as the network of open spaces pathways and nodes. All wings of the building \nare set back from the street to align with the existing houses and other Student Housing \nbuildings. The massing of the building transitions in scale from 5 storeys along 111th Street \nto 4 storeys for the “wings” fronting 89th and 90th Avenues to respect the scale of the \nexisting community.  \n111th Street (Urban Boulevard)- The main entrance and drop off to the building is located \nmid-block on 111th Street which will help to promote pedestrian traffic from the nodes at the \nintersections of 89th and 90th Avenues creating a vibrant pedestrian oriented urban street. \nThe building massing is 5 storeys as a transition from the lower scale East Campus Village \nto the east and the Academic Campus to the west. \n89th and 90th Avenue- The avenues are pedestrian oriented and residential in scale. The \n90th Avenue neighbour includes the Peter Lougheed Leadership College and the 89th \nAvenue neighbour is the Pinecrest House Student housing. The building wings facing these \navenues are 4 storeys in height and have multiple entrances to the street in an urban \n“brownstone” configuration.  \nNorth/South Pedestrian Pathway and Nodes- A north/south mid-block pedestrian \npathway connecting a network of open spaces bounds the eastern edge of the site. The \nECV 9 design responds to the pathway by providing landscape courtyards, patio and a \nsecond “community “ entrance adjacent the pathway. The existing east/west oriented lane \nbetween 89th and 90th Avenue terminates at our site providing vehicular access for loading, \nrefuse pick up and drop off. \nThe ECV 9 Student Housing project was designed using the Design Guidelines for Infill \nDevelopment- Garneau document. The goal of the document is the production and \npreservation of a mix of styles and types of housing appropriate to the community and to \nestablish a planning and design framework for the development of architectural and \nlandscape elements in the context of the neighbourhood, the site and for the proposed \ndevelopment. \nThe site planning and landscape design of the ECV project responds to the guidelines as \nfollows: \n Maintain the scale and general character of the existing neighbourhood- The new \nbuildings are four storeys in height which is similar in scale to the existing houses. \nThe buildings have been located to align the front building façades with the existing \nhouses. \n For multi- lot housing provide for multiple entrances off the street for more of a \ntownhouse look and creating a sense of comfort at street level – The residences \n  East Campus Village 9 Student Housing \nDesign Development Report \n  DESIGN DEVELOPMENT REPORT – JUNE 9, 2016   \n16 \nhave been designed with some of the lower level having multiple entrances with \ndirect access to the street.  \n Transitions between public, semi-public and private spaces are achieved through \nchanges in level, building articulation and landscape articulation.- stairs to entry \nlevels, internal sidewalks and landscaped front yards and plazas are incorporated to \nprovide transitions.  \n Minimize vehicular access to and use within the site- The increased density of the \nECV 9 project will not increase vehicular traffic as no additional parking stalls have \nbeen added. \n Maintain and enhance pedestrian and bicycle paths.- The existing north/south \npedestrian and bicycle path has been extended and enhanced \nSite Planning Logistics \nParking- No additional parking has been provided for this project. \nBicycle Storage- A large indoor student bicycle storage room is provided adjacent to the \nmain building entrance.  \nWaste Removal- A waste and recycle station will be provided on site adjacent to the east \nentrance to the building. Residents will be responsible for carrying their waste to the \nstations for pick up by the U of A.  \nFire Fighting Access will be from a hydrant located along 111th Street as well as from the \nAvenues. Fire hydrants will be located to ensure conformance with the building code. \nSite utilities- New services for Water, Sanitary and Storm will be installed by the U of A to \nprovide service to the buildings. A new gas service will be installed and coordinated by the \nU of A. Electrical power will be provided by a new transformer located adjacent to the \npedestrian pathway at the east edge of the property. \n  East Campus Village 9 Student Housing \nDesign Development Report \n  DESIGN DEVELOPMENT REPORT – JUNE 9, 2016   \n17 \n  East Campus Village 9 Student Housing \nDesign Development Report \n  DESIGN DEVELOPMENT REPORT – JUNE 9, 2016   \n18 \n5.0      LANDSCAPE DESIGN CONCEPT \nIntroduction- Site Concept \nThe proposed site development plan begins with the preservation of mature trees on the \nboulevard to ensure the retention of the neighbourhood street character on the site \nperimeter.  Although there was a fairly extensive amount of existing plant material on the \nsite proper, only a small portion of those plants could be considered specimens, and of \nthose only a select few will be able to be protected from the activity of construction.  Those \ndeemed important specimens which can be protected from root damage during site \nexcavation, have been worked into the new planting scheme for the site.  Additional \nplantings will provide visual interest, both from views to the building from the outside and \nfrom the inside of the building looking out.  The final selection of landscape materials is \nbased on colour, form, texture and sustainability, during all the seasons of the year.  \nCirculation \nThe perimeter of the site is serviced by the existing city sidewalk which will remain intact \nalthough expanded at the west building entrance to create an ample gathering space, \nseating opportunities and drop off.  An expansion of the city walk at the Southwest corner \nof the site provides for a small public seating area at the intersection.  A  North-South \npedestrian corridor, as defined by the University Sector Plan, provides the East boundary of \nthe site.  Internal pedestrian circulation is closely aligned with desire lines to building \naccess points, minimizing vast areas of paving and maximizing soft landscape areas. The \ntwo courtyards provide opportunities for sitting, reading, conversing with others and \ngenerally relaxing in an outdoor environment within the confines of the development.  The \nmulti-purpose space of the building expands into the South courtyard providing for an \noutdoor gathering space suitable for both programmed activities and informal passive use.   \nIn all cases of exterior circulation, concrete will be the dominant material, with opportunities \nbeing considered for accents with colour, textures, and saw-cutting patterns. \nAmenities and Site Furnishings \nSeating is provided in various locations to allow for small groups or solitary activity.  \nSeating is provided both as a function of another site feature such as a low wall or raised \nplanter, as well as a traditional pre-manufactured bench.   Waste/recycle receptacles are \nstrategically located to cover desire lines of travel, close to building entrances and in areas \nof anticipated activities. Recognizing the need of residents as well as visitors, bicycle racks \nare located at the west building entrance adjacent the bike storage area, and east building \nentrance.  The only fencing proposed on site is a 1.8 M height fence wall installed to \nenclose and screen the waste bin on the east side of the site adjacent the lane.  The multi-\npurpose patio has a main feature of a proposed fireplace / barbeque and would have \nmoveable seating and tables that could be organized in different arrangements depending \non the activity. \nLandscape Planting \nLandscaping on the public street faces of the building focus generally on two layers of \nplanting.  The first is a foundation planting of low shrubs and perennials either against the \nbuilding foundation or set away with window wells, providing that softening at the point at \nwhich the building meets the ground plane.  This treatment is consistent around the \nbuilding, expanding at the corners in response to blank wall space, and turning to meet the \npublic sidewalk wherever there is a walkway connection to a building unit.  The second \nlayer is a consistent row of smaller flowering trees that help to bring the building scale down \nfrom a passing pedestrian point of view while providing a colour accent along the building \nface. Landscaping in the courtyard spaces is generally expressed in several layers \nconsisting of trees, shrubs, grasses and groundcover, in a mix of rectilinear patterns drawn \nfrom the building form, as well as more free form patterns providing variation of form on the \nground plane.   The basic intent is to provide visual interest both in the outdoor spaces and \nfrom inside the building looking out.  The North-South pedestrian corridor provides the east \nboundary of the site and is lined with small canopy trees. All woody ornamental and \nperennial planting will conform to the standards of the Canadian Nursery Landscape \nAssociation (CNLA), sod to the Canadian Nursery Sod Growers of Landscape Alberta \n(CNSGLA) and turf grass seed to the Canadian Seed Trade Association (CSTA).  \nSite Lighting \nLandscape lighting in conjunction with building lighting will provide for safe site navigation \nby pedestrians and allow for accent lighting in amenity areas. \nIrrigation \nAn irrigation system has not been included in this project. \n  East Campus Village 9 Student Housing \nDesign Development Report \n  DESIGN DEVELOPMENT REPORT – JUNE 9, 2016   \n19 \n  East Campus Village 9 Student Housing \nDesign Development Report \n  DESIGN DEVELOPMENT REPORT – JUNE 9, 2016   \n20 \n6.0     CIVIL DESIGN \nGeneral Information \nThe proposed location of the proposed East Campus Village 9 student residence is east of \n111th Avenue between 89th & 90th Avenues.  It will displace 6 small residential dwellings, 3 \nfacing north to 90 avenue and 3 facing south to 89th Avenue.  There are existing \nunderground gas main and existing above grade power utilities that are in conflict with the \nproposed building and will require re-routing. \nThe existing grade of the site slopes consistently from south to north.  The grade is not \naggressive but over the distance between the avenues amounts to a significant 2.5m \ndifferential.  This grade change posed interesting challenges and unique opportunities for \nfloor layouts and relationships to the existing and potential pedestrian pathways bordering \nthe development footprint. \nSite Grading \nThe grading design is framed primarily by the floor elevations, which in turn are limited by a \ndesign team determined ~3% slope limits from main doors along 111th Street to the \nadjoining sidewalk.  The east courtyard grades then had to conform to maximum window \nwell depths and door openings to these areas. \nThe inter-relations between these elements resulted in a building design that sought to take \nadvantage of the significant grade change south to north by allowing a basement to be \ndesigned on the low end of the site while transitioning the main floor to a below grade wing \nwhere the natural grade was higher to the south. \nThis provides for minimization of window well depths that still allow positive drainage away \nfrom the building perimeter.  To the north the grades, though shallow, should allow for \nadequate runoff slopes while on the south, the adjacent grades must be raised to meet \nheight limits for the second floor.  This leaves the south frontage approximately 0.6m higher \nthan the existing 89th Avenue sidewalks.  The means of traversing this difference is \ncurrently under review. \nIn the courtyard areas there exist similar transition challenges going from the upper floor \nexit doors down to the courtyard where there are also access doors to grade from the floor \nbelow.  Window wells in the north courtyard will be necessary to make these grade and \ndrainage elevations work.  The south courtyard elevation will allow near full exposure to the \nmain (lower) floor windows. \nThroughout the design process every effort will be made to identify existing mature trees for \nprotection from adverse development impacts.  This included grade transitions that may \naffect root systems. \nStorm Service \nExisting storm mains around the proposed development run NORTH/SOUTH along 111th \nStreet and east of the future building, but west of the existing residences to remain.  \nUniversity Utility Services has indicated a preference to tie the new development into the \nstorm services to the east. \nRoof drainage and collection of roof gutter water is intended to be gathered in piping run \nunder slab. Conveyance of storm water eastward though the north wing is being \nconsidered.  This would allow a common trenching strategy of the sanitary and storm piping \nrather than separated, individual trenches for each service which offers fewer installation \nefficiencies.   \nStorm services from the building would exit the east end of the northerly EAST/WEST wing \nand tie to an existing storm manhole just east of the northerly EAST/WEST wing.  We have \nbeen informed that the available storm main is sufficiently deep but this will be confirmed as \nthe design progresses. \nThe courtyard areas will also require drainage infrastructure piped to eventually connect to \nthe same storm mains that the building storm system will drain to.  Piping connected to \nthese drains can be oversized to reduce the probability of ice blockages forming during \nshoulder seasons. \nIt appears possible to connect the north courtyard into the north wing under-slab storm \npiping.  Due to the bottom floor elevation being lower, it is anticipated that the under slab \nstorm piping depth will not be unreasonably deep. \nHowever, beneath portions of the main floor where no bottom floor exists storm services \nfrom the south courtyard run under slab may be in excess of 6 feet below finished floor \nelevation.  Though commonly done, running storm piping at such depths below building \nfloor slabs does present some risk and is therefore typically avoided.  In this case the south \ncourtyard may be connected directly to the central manhole east of the middle EAST/WEST \nwing. \nThe precise configuration of these and other elements within the courtyards will be \ndetermined as the grading and landscaping designs evolve. \nSanitary Service \nAn existing sanitary main currently run NORTH/SOUTH east of the proposed building, but \nwest of the existing residences to remain.  University Utility Services has indicated that the \nnew development is to tie into these service mains. \nCollection sanitary piping would run under slab of both the main floor areas where no \nbottom floor exists, then drop under slab of the bottom floor once encountered.  As with \n  East Campus Village 9 Student Housing \nDesign Development Report \n  DESIGN DEVELOPMENT REPORT – JUNE 9, 2016   \n21 \nstorm services, conveyance eastward through the northerly EAST/WEST wing is being \nconsidered tying to an existing sanitary manhole just east of the northerly EAST/WEST \nwing.  Again, this would allow a common trenching strategy of the sanitary and storm piping \nrather than separated, individual trenches for each service which offers fewer installation \nefficiencies. \nWe have been informed that the available sanitary main is sufficiently deep but this will be \nconfirmed as the design progresses. \nDomestic & Fire Water Service \nDomestic water for the proposed development will be serviced from existing 300mm water \nmain to the West. There also exists a 400mm water main however this main is outside of \nthe University’s jurisdiction and is not to be accessed. \nA 200mm water service extension is being considered to service both the domestic and fire \nwater demand for the building.  From this service line, a 150mm pipe will be teed from it to \nprovide fire hydrant coverage within 45m of the building fire department connection. \nThe exact location of the fire department connection and hydrant are currently in design. \nNatural Gas Service: \nUniversity Utility Services is coordinating with Atco Gas for the removal and re-routing of \ngas mains that currently run EAST/WEST through the centre of the proposed development \nsite.  A stub is intended to remain from which gas service for the proposed building will be \nconnected. \nA gas meter location has been tentatively selected within the north courtyard. \n  East Campus Village 9 Student Housing \nDesign Development Report \n  DESIGN DEVELOPMENT REPORT – JUNE 9, 2016   \n22 \n7.0      BUILDING DESIGN - ARCHITECTURAL \nGuiding Principals \nThe ECV 9 Student Housing Building has been designed to respond to the overall design \ngoals and objectives of enhancing a positive student experience, to support the \nachievement of academic goals and to build community.  \nGuiding Principles include: \n Engaging the identity of a place \n Interpreting the context \n Creating a third place: activate community building \n Transcending the present: traditional and modern \nThe building design follows the development guidelines and requirements set out in three \npredominate documents; The Garneau Infill Design Guidelines, The Sector 8 Plan as well \nas the University’s Long Range Development Plan.

The proposed exterior finish materials are residential in nature and \nwill provide a consistent aesthetic compatible with the existing houses in the community. \nThe design concept responds to the unique urban characteristics of the surrounding 89/90th \nAve and 111th Street as well as the network of open spaces pathways and nodes. All wings \nof the building are set back from the street to align with the existing houses and other \nstudent housing buildings. The massing of the building transitions in scale from 5 storeys \nalong 111th Street to 4 storeys for the “wings” fronting 89th and 90th Avenues to respect the \nscale of the existing community. The building massing is broken down through form, height \nand variations in application of similar materials as well as colour.  \nThe main entrance on 111th Street utilizes extensive curtainwall glazing and slanted \nstructural columns to provide a modern, playful expression to compliment the primarily \ncraftsman vernacular. The entry feature and adjacent social spaces, including the outdoor \nrooftop patio will capture the evening setting sun while providing expansive views back to \nthe campus.  \nFinishes/Colour Palette Options \nAt the completion of the Design Development stage the exterior finishes have been \ndeveloped and actual products will be selected through coordination with the design build \ncontractor. Colour options will be developed and reviewed with the University Architect and \nAncillary services prior to final selection. \nThe primary exterior material used is a cementitous panel system such as “Hardie Board” \nwhich is applied in various patterns, detailing and colours to provide a breakup of the large \nwall surfaces. \nThe 1- storey high brick along 111th Street provides a strong base that helps to horizontally \nbreak up the 5 storey height of the building as well as providing a durable material along \nand near the front entrance. \nThe material/ colour palette above is representative of the direction at this stage and will be \nrefined further as the project progress in consultation with the University Architect and Ancillary \nServices. \n  East Campus Village 9 Student Housing \nDesign Development Report \n  DESIGN DEVELOPMENT REPORT – JUNE 9, 2016   \n36 \nThe following building elevations note the type, location and extent of finishes. \nAdministrator\nSnapshot\n  East Campus Village 9 Student Housing \nDesign Development Report \n  DESIGN DEVELOPMENT REPORT – JUNE 9, 2016   \n37 \nJeff Milos\nSnapshot\n  East Campus Village 9 Student Housing \nDesign Development Report \n  DESIGN DEVELOPMENT REPORT – JUNE 9, 2016   \n38 \nAdministrator\nSnapshot\n  East Campus Village 9 Student Housing \nDesign Development Report \n  DESIGN DEVELOPMENT REPORT – JUNE 9, 2016   \n39 \nAdministrator\nSnapshot\n  East Campus Village 9 Student Housing \nDesign Development Report \n  DESIGN DEVELOPMENT REPORT – JUNE 9, 2016   \n40 \nAdministrator\nSnapshot\n  East Campus Village 9 Student Housing \nDesign Development Report \n  DESIGN DEVELOPMENT REPORT – JUNE 9, 2016   \n40 \nBird’s Eye View from Northwest \n  East Campus Village 9 Student Housing \nDesign Development Report \n  DESIGN DEVELOPMENT REPORT – JUNE 9, 2016   \n41 \nBird’s Eye View from Southwest \n  East Campus Village 9 Student Housing \nDesign Development Report \n  DESIGN DEVELOPMENT REPORT – JUNE 9, 2016   \n42 \nElevation along 111th St. \n  East Campus Village 9 Student Housing \nDesign Development Report \n  DESIGN DEVELOPMENT REPORT – JUNE 9, 2016   \n43 \nMain Entry along 111th St. \n  East Campus Village 9 Student Housing \nDesign Development Report \n  DESIGN DEVELOPMENT REPORT – JUNE 9, 2016   \n44 \nMain Entrance \n  East Campus Village 9 Student Housing \nDesign Development Report \n  DESIGN DEVELOPMENT REPORT – JUNE 9, 2016   \n45 \nMain Entrance at Night \n  East Campus Village 9 Student Housing \nDesign Development Report \n  DESIGN DEVELOPMENT REPORT – JUNE 9, 2016   \n46 \nPerspective from 111th St. and 89th Ave. \n  East Campus Village 9 Student Housing \nDesign Development Report \n  DESIGN DEVELOPMENT REPORT – JUNE 9, 2016   \n47 \nElevation along 89th Ave. \n  East Campus Village 9 Student Housing \nDesign Development Report \n  DESIGN DEVELOPMENT REPORT – JUNE 9, 2016   \n48 \nResidential Entry along 89th Ave. \n  East Campus Village 9 Student Housing \nDesign Development Report \n  DESIGN DEVELOPMENT REPORT – JUNE 9, 2016   \n49 \nPerspective from 111th St. and 90th Ave. \n  East Campus Village 9 Student Housing \nDesign Development Report \n  DESIGN DEVELOPMENT REPORT – JUNE 9, 2016   \n50 \nView along 111th St. including Pinecrest House \n  East Campus Village 9 Student Housing \nDesign Development Report \n  DESIGN DEVELOPMENT REPORT – JUNE 9, 2016   \n51 \nView along 89th Ave. including Pinecrest House \n  East Campus Village 9 Student Housing \nDesign Development Report \n  DESIGN DEVELOPMENT REPORT – JUNE 9, 2016   \n52 \nView looking West into the Outdoor Courtyards and Amenity Areas \n  East Campus Village 9 Student Housing \nDesign Development Report \n  DESIGN DEVELOPMENT REPORT – JUNE 9, 2016   \n53 \nBird’s Eye of the Outdoor Courtyards and Amenity Area including the North-South Pedestrian Path \n  East Campus Village 9 Student Housing \nDesign Development Report \n  DESIGN DEVELOPMENT REPORT – JUNE 9, 2016   \n54 \nAmenity Area Outside of the Multi-Function Room \n  East Campus Village 9 Student Housing \nDesign Development Report \n  DESIGN DEVELOPMENT REPORT – JUNE 9, 2016   \n55 \nINTERIOR DESIGN CONCEPT \n          There are four distinct functional zones which have specific functional requirements: \nPublicly Accessed Common Spaces (Main Lobby Common Lounge, Multipurpose \nRoom, Small Study Spaces, Huddle Rooms, Fitness Room) \nThese spaces will be designed to reflect the character of the facility and will have an open \nindustrial studio feel with large flexible open spaces, and a fresh energetic design. \nThe focus is on creating a dynamic youthful space that also warm and welcoming. \nProviding a variety of gathering spaces and flexibility of layout allowing for easy \nreconfiguration is a key component to these areas.

Cast-in-place concrete \nis an excellent structural system that can be custom designed to meet stringent vibration \nand deflection specifications as well as provide good acoustic values and fire resistance. \nDurability \nThe structural system has been chosen to reduce on-going maintenance costs. \nGreen Design \nConsideration has been given to structural materials with high recycled material content.  \nRecycled materials such as fly ash will be specified for use in the concrete mix designs. \n           Design Criteria \nThe structural design is to be undertaken in accordance with the latest codes and \nstandards, including but not limited to: \nAlberta Building Code 2014 Edition (ABC 2014) \nStructural Steel Design CAN/CSA-S16 \nReinforced Concrete Design CAN/CSA-A23.3 \nCold Formed Steel Design CSA S136 \nDesign Dead Load \nThe structural design dead load is to incorporate the actual anticipated loads in various \ndesignated areas. The minimum design dead loads for each of following areas are: \nTypical Floor = 5.8kPa \nRoof = 5.8kPa \nThe above loads may not govern all areas and some portions of the building may require \nindividual consideration. \nDesign Live Load Due to Occupancy \nThe design live loads for each of the areas and occupancies of the building will be as a \nminimum in accordance with the recommended live loads stipulated in the ABC unless \nlisted below.  \n  East Campus Village 9 Student Housing \nDesign Development Report \n  DESIGN DEVELOPMENT REPORT – JUNE 9, 2016   \n69 \nResidential Areas  = 1.9kPa \nCorridors and Common Areas = 4.8kPa \nMechanical Room = 7.2kPa \nRoof = 1.5kPa \nThe structural design is to incorporate the actual anticipated loads in the various \ndesignated areas, which are unique to the building occupancy, and all equipment loads \nwhich will be individually considered. \nDesign Loads due to Snow, Ice and Rain \nThe structure of the roof is to be designed using the normal importance category as \ndescribed in table 4.1.2.1 in the ABC for a 1-in-50 year ground snow load and \naccompanying rain load stipulated in Appendix C of the ABC. An importance factor of 1.0 is \nto be used for Ultimate Limit States (ULS) design and an importance factor of 0.9 is to be \nused for Serviceability Limit States (SLS) design. The loads on sloping roofs and \naccumulations on roofs adjacent to projections of other portions of the structure will be as \nspecified in the ABC. \nThe structure of the roof is also to be designed to support the accumulation of rainwater on \na surface from the one-day rainfall as stipulated in the ABC. \nThe snow load and rain data for Edmonton is as follows: \n Ss = 1.7kPa \n Sr = 0.1kPa \n One day rain (1/50) = 97mm \n Design Loads due to Wind \nThe main structure of the residence building is to be designed using the normal importance \ncategory as described in table 4.1.2.1 for a 1-in-50 year hourly wind pressure loads as \nstipulated in the ABC. An importance factor of 1.0 is to be used for the ULS design and an \nimportance factor of 0.75 is to be used for SLS design. The internal pressure category as \ndescribed in Commentary I of the User’s Guide, NBC 2010 Structural Commentaries is \ncategory 2.  The wind drift for the structure will be limited to h/500 where h is the height of \nthe structure.  Wind uplift pressure will be provided on the structural drawings for design of \nthe individual structural roof components.  \nThe wind data for Edmonton is as follows: \n Wind Pressure (1/50) = 0.45kPa \nDesign Load due to Earthquake \nThe main structure of the residence building will be designed using the normal importance \ncategory as described in table 4.1.2.1 to withstand the lateral forces that may occur as a \nresult of ground acceleration. The 5%-damped horizontal spectral acceleration values for \nperiods T of 0.2, 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 seconds and the peak ground acceleration (PGA) value \nfor earthquake design as stipulated in the ABC is to be considered. An importance factor of \n1.0 is to be used for ULS design. Based off the geotechnical evaluation report prepared by \nThurber Engineering Ltd. the site classification for the subject site is Class D. \nThe seismic data for Edmonton and a Class C site are as follows: \n Sa(0.2) = 0.10 \n Sa(0.5) = 0.06 \n Sa(1.0) = 0.03 \n Sa(2.0) = 0.01 \n PGA = 0.04 \n Fa = 1.3 \n Fv = 1.4 \nThe SFRS Ductility-Related Force Modification Factor and Overstrength-Related Force \nModification Factor are as follows: \n Rd = 1.5 \n Ro = 1.3 \nThe drift limit under seismic loads for normal importance structures is 0.025hs where hs is \nthe overall height of the structure. \nBUILDING STRUCTURE \nProposed Construction Materials \nThe following construction materials are proposed for East Campus Village Residence \nBuilding: \nReinforcing Steel for Concrete and Masonry – 400W \nConcrete  \n Foundation Concrete - 30MPa @ 28 days (GU cement) \n  Slab on Grade - 25MPa @ 28 days (GU cement) \n  Structural Stoops - 35MPa @ 28 days (GU cement) \n  Sidewalks - 32MPa @ 28days (GU cement) \n  East Campus Village 9 Student Housing \nDesign Development Report \n  DESIGN DEVELOPMENT REPORT – JUNE 9, 2016   \n70 \n  Building Columns and Walls – 30MPa to 35MPa @ 28 days (GU cement) \n  Upper Level Structural Slabs – 35MPa @ 28 days (GU cement) \nStructural Steel – 350W \nCold Formed Steel – 228MPa \nFoundation System \nThe foundation design will be based off design recommendations from the geotechnical \nreport prepared by Thurber Engineering Ltd. dated November 30, 2015 and titled \n‘University of Alberta Main Campus – East Campus Village 3 Residential Building’.  Both \nFootings and Concrete Piles are considered feasible for the proposed site.  Based on the \nbuilding loads and the building configuration structurally a footing foundation is \nrecommended.   \nThe factored design parameters presented in the geotechnical report for the footing options \nare as follows:  \n Strip Footings = 175kPa \n Spread Footings = 200kPa \nNegligible concentrations of water soluble sulphate were encountered in the soils therefore \ntype GU cement can be utilized for all foundation concrete.  \n Main Floor \nThe main floor will consist of a minimum 130 mm reinforced cast-in-place concrete slab on \ngrade on a soil gas impermeable vapour suppression membrane / vapour barrier as per the \narchitectural requirements supported on compacted, clean, well-graded granular base over \nsuitable bearing soils.  The sub-grade preparation must be done in conformance with the \nrecommendations outline in the geotechnical report to minimize potential slab movements. \nCast-in-place concrete structurally supported floors on void form will be provided for all \nexterior concrete stoops at doorways and any other areas which may be designated as \n“sensitive to movement” and where excessive amount of fill material are present. \n Typical Upper Floor System \nThe typical upper floor structure will consist of a minimum 200mm flat plate concrete slab \nsupported by concrete columns.  The floor structures will be designed based on a total load \ndeflection of L/360 and a live load deflection of L/480. \n Typical Roof System \nThe typical roof structure will consist of a minimum 200mm flat plate concrete slab \nsupported by concrete columns.  The roof structures will be designed based on a total load \ndeflection of L/240 and a live load deflection of L/360. \nThe roof structure shall also be designed to support equipment installed above the roof \nstructure as well as the potential for future solar panels. Refer to the architectural and the \nmechanical layout for locations, weights and sizes of the equipment above the roof \nstructure. \n Lateral Load Resisting System \nThe lateral load resisting system will consist of conventional concrete shear walls. \nDELEGATED STRUCTURAL DESIGN \nThe design of some of the structural components will be delegated to others.  These \ncomponents include the concrete mix design, structural steel connections for any \nmiscellaneous steel components, and wind bearing metal studs.  The structural drawings \nand specifications will provide the necessary design criteria, specifications and relevant \ninformation for the design of these components.  Shop drawings for these components \nsigned and sealed by the professional engineer responsible for their design will be required \nto be submitted by the contractor and these shop drawings shall be reviewed by the \ngeneral contractor as well as the relevant consultants for general conformance to the \nproject requirements and specifications. \nGREEN GLOBES DESIGN \nIn terms of the structure of the building, environmental responsibility is achieved by using \nconstruction materials high in recycled content. For the concrete component of the \nstructure, an effective mix may be designed where fly ash, slag or silica fume replace a \ncertain percentage of the cementations materials. Replacing Portland Cement with recycled \ncontent in this way is a sustainable design choice that will also result in a cost savings. \nRecycled aggregate can also be used successfully in concrete structures as well as for \ncompacted granular fill below slab on grade.  \n  East Campus Village 9 Student Housing \nDesign Development Report \n  DESIGN DEVELOPMENT REPORT – JUNE 9, 2016   \n71 \n9.0 MECHANICAL \nIntroduction \nThe purpose of the Mechanical Design Development report is to convey the fundamental system \ndesign philosophy to the Owner and Design Team.

contained in this report are to \ndescribe the Design Development concepts. \nThis report outlines specific strategies for the electrical systems of the proposed \nfacility and will form the basis for the development of the Design Development phase \nof the project.  \nA basic outline of the perceived strategies for power distribution, low-tension \nsystems, communication systems and life safety systems for the proposed East \nCampus Village 9 Residence have been included to summarize discussions and \nconcepts developed to date. \nThe electrical services proposed for the East Campus Village 9 Residence are \nbased upon an anticipated gross building area of approximately 10,550 m2. \nThe electrical design will be based on the following applicable University of Alberta \nand other applicable standards including: \n University of Alberta, Facilities Management Commissioning Manual. \n University of Alberta, Electrical Design Guidelines. \n University of Alberta, Guidelines for Design and Installation of Street, \nSidewalk and Area Lighting – Revised October 2000. \n University of Alberta, Fire Alarm Design Standards, draft copy issued January \n2005. \n University of Alberta, Electric Utility Standards, draft issued December 2004. \n ANSI, IEEE, EEMAC Standard for High and Low Voltage Switchgear. \n Latest adopted Canadian Electrical Code – Part I. \n Regulations of the Alberta Electrical Protection Branch – Safety Codes Act. \n Latest Alberta Building Code. \n Latest Alberta Fire Code. \n CSA Standard C282-05 Emergency Electrical Power Supply for Buildings. \n CSA Standard B651-95 Barrier Free Design. \n Latest CSA Fire Alarm Standards and ULC Standards. \n Latest Illuminating Engineering Society of North America (IESNA) Standards. \n IST Telecommunications Design Guidelines, University of Alberta Cabling \nStandards (Version 2.4, May 2, 2016). \n University of Alberta, Lighting Design Guidelines and Standards (January \n2009, Revision 0.2). \nEach system presented in this report will be open to further in-depth review with the \nuser groups and University of Alberta Facility Management group.   \nSUSTAINABLE DESIGN CONSIDERATIONS \nThe East Campus Village 9 Residence design will be based upon achieving a Green \nGlobes 3 minimum certification. The rationale for engaging in sustainable design is to \ncreate a facility that will contribute to reduced demands on the earth resources. There \nare four areas that are impacted by engaging Green Globe practices into electrical \nsystems including: \n energy conservation, \n renewable energy usage, \n light pollution reduction, and \n indoor environmental quality. \nSustainability design for the East Campus Village 9 Residence will be considered \nbased on how Facilities and Operations can maintain these systems and have the \nbudgets to sustain the systems for operations and replacement of these systems. \nFurther review of these systems will be required during the next phase of design. \nIn discussions with the University of Alberta, a sub-metering system was proposed as \na value add system but will not be considered for this project. Metering will only be \nprovided at the service entrance. \nOther sustainable design options and value add options to be considered for review \nare: \na. Photovoltaics:  \ni. Infrastructure and space to be allocated for the PV system inverters, \npanel and transformer to be connected to the main distribution panel. \nb. LED Lighting:  \ni. LED lighting to be considered to be used throughout the facility \nEnergy Conservation \nElectrical energy comprises a small portion of the total energy consumed by a facility \nbut when expressed in actual utility costs, the electrical system consumes \napproximately 20 - 40% of the total building’s energy budget. The following initiatives \nwill be adopted in the design to reduce the building’s energy consumption: \n1. Use the latest illumination technology including a combination of LED and \nfluorescent. \n2. The Minimum Energy Performance prerequisite in Green Globes is intended to \ncomply with the minimum level of energy efficiency as specified in latest version \nof ASHRAE 90.1 and Current Alberta Building Code. \n  East Campus Village 9 Student Housing \nDesign Development Report \n  DESIGN DEVELOPMENT REPORT – JUNE 9, 2016   \n97 \n3. Other measures that can further improve the baseline energy performance is the \nuse of occupancy sensors, dimming controls, photocells, and improved local \ncontrols. An interface to the University’s building automation system (BACNet) \nwill optimize the use of lighting and ventilation systems when a space is occupied \nand reduced usage when spaces are not occupied.  \n4. Engineered lighting systems to provide appropriate lighting levels that are safe \nand effective. Lighting will comply with prescribed guidelines rather than using \nlight levels that are on the high end of the IESNA (Illuminating Engineering \nSociety of North America) standard. It is proposed that lower ambient lighting \nlevels be employed in offices, suites, circulation spaces, and corridors. \nLighting Control of Perimeter and Non-Perimeter Spaces \nA value add item discussed with the University of Alberta was to consider an advanced \ndigital lighting control system technology but wasn’t deemed viable for this type of \nbuilding.   \nA line voltage control system with occupancy and daylight sensors will be used in \ncombination throughout this building with a connection to the BMS system.   \n       ELECTRICAL SYSTEMS \nSite Services \nThe University of Alberta Electrical Utilities will be removing the existing utility power \npoles in the alleyway of 111st and refeeding the existing buildings with new \nunderground feeders.  \nA new pad mounted 13.8kV / 600V transformer and metering cubicle will be provided \nfor this site by the University of Alberta.   Exact location of pad mounted transformer \nand metering cubicle to be confirmed in the next phase of design.  Conduit will be \nprovided by the University of Alberta from the pad mounted transformer to the building \nproperty line. The electrical contractor will then extend the conduit to the main \nelectrical room and provide secondary feeders between the transformer and the main \ndistribution panel. \nPower Distribution System Design \nThe total calculated demand load for East Campus Village 9 Residence is estimated at \napproximately 506kW based on a building size of 10,550 m2. An 800A, 347/600V \nservice is estimated but the calculated demand loads and historic peak demand of the \nother East Campus Village residences will need to be further reviewed with University \nof Alberta Electrical Utilities to determine a suitable size pad-mounted transformer and \nmain distribution panel. \nMain Electrical Room  \nThe East Campus Village 9 Residence service entrance switchgear will be metal \nenclosed 600V will be metal-enclosed indoor rated, with withdrawable-type power-air \ncircuit breakers complete with programmable protective relays.   \nNormal Power Distribution: \nThe standard operating, distribution and utilization voltages for East Campus Village 9 \nResidence will be 600V, 3-phase, 3-wire and 120/208V, 3-phase, 4-wire. \nTransformers, elevators, and large motors will be fed with 600V feeders.  \nAll other loads will be supplied from 120/208V, 3-phase, 4-wire electrical distribution \nsystems. 120/208V, 3-phase, 4-wire panelboards will be located in the North and \nSouth wings on each floor which will then further distribute out to 120/208V single \nphase panels located within the suites. The panelboards will have a minimum of 25% \nspare for future use. \nEmergency Power Distribution: \nAll life safety systems will be backed up by battery units including lighting, exit lighting \nand fire alarm systems.  \nGrounding and Bonding \nGrounding system has been designed to provide a low impedance path for ground \nfault currents to flow.  \nEach of the electrical rooms will have a grounding bus connected to the building's \nmain system ground, which in turn will be connected to the ground grid.  All non-\ncurrent-carrying metal parts of equipment in the electrical rooms will be bonded to \nground per Canadian Electrical Code.  This will include all metal raceways, equipment \nenclosures, metal structures, low tension systems, and miscellaneous metal systems.  \nA bonding conductor will be provided in each conduit. \nEach of the telecommunication rooms will have a grounding bus connected to the \nbuilding's main system ground, which in turn will be connected to the ground grid. \nGeneral Wiring \nAll wiring will be installed in conduit. Copper wiring is recommended to be used in this \nfacility however aluminum wiring has been accepted as a cost saving initiative on \nconductors larger than 200A on previous projects and should be considered for this \nproject. \nThe use of cable tray systems will only be used in accessible ceiling spaces where \nrequired. \n  East Campus Village 9 Student Housing \nDesign Development Report \n  DESIGN DEVELOPMENT REPORT – JUNE 9, 2016   \n98 \nCabling for life safety systems such as elevators, fire alarm systems, etc. will be \nminimum one-hour fire rated.   \nDrive-rated cables will be used from VFD’s to the motors when they are separated by \nmore than 10m of cable length from the VFD’s. \nLighting \nThe lighting system will be designed to provide for the functional requirements of the \ninstallation. The Illuminating Engineering Society of North America (IESNA) standards \nand the University of Alberta lighting design guide will be the key references.  \nEstablished standards and parameters for a residential facility will be used for the \ndesign as they apply to specific areas; however these standards and parameters may \nbe altered to achieve Green Globes certification. Energy consumption considerations \nand lighting levels will be carefully weighed with the benefits of achieving a Green \nGlobes certification. \nThe lighting system for the East Campus Village 9 Residence will be designed to \nprovide integration of numerous lighting techniques to provide vibrant and attractive \natmosphere that is both inviting and engaging for the people within the space. It is the \nintent to provide layered lighting within public circulation and gathering areas that will \nenhance the building’s profile on campus. It will both augment and add to the \narchitectural elements of the space in providing a visually stimulating environment that \nis comfortable and welcoming. It is the intention that the design will integrate the \nvarious aspects of the lighting system with the building’s space functions, mechanical \nsystems, and architectural elements.  Integration of natural light captured by the \nbuilding will take on a key role in achieving desired illumination. \nThe basis of design will include LED luminaires throughout the facility. \nLighting Control System \nAll building lighting will be controlled to decrease energy use, allow flexibility, and to \nmeet the requirements of the University of Alberta. The lighting control system will be a \nline voltage system with a combination of local and automatic controls that will \ninterface with the Building Automation System. Controls will include:  \ni. Occupancy sensors will be provided in all public areas including corridors, \nsocial spaces, washrooms, and similar spaces. \nii. Storage rooms and utility rooms to be complete with local on/off combination \noccupancy sensor switch.  \niii. Suites: Lighting control within suites to be a combination switch/sensor with \n'vacancy' setting; manual on, auto off. \niv. Central time clock control. All general building lighting, with the exception of \nsuites and low-usage areas will be controlled using a central time clock via \nthe BMS system.  \nv. Daylight sensors will be considered for the perimeter spaces, recreation \nroom, fitness room, upper floor corridors and social spaces. This daylight \ncontrol will either shut off the nearest fixture to the windows or dim the \nluminaires in these areas. \nThe control system is being provided to meet the requirements of the Green Globes \nprogram and intended to not only increase user comfort and ease of maintenance, but \nto reduce the energy usage in the building.  \nFire Alarm System \nThe fire alarm system will be a single-stage, annunciated, class A-wired and \nelectrically supervised system.  Zoning of the fire alarm system will be based on \nsmoke zone subdivision. System devices will be of the addressable type and will \nconsist of manual pull station, products-of-combustion detectors, thermal detectors, \nand sprinkler flow valves. \nFire alarm sounding devices will be of the audible and visual (strobe) type in \ncompliance with the latest Alberta Barrier-Free Code requirements.  \nMain Fire Alarm Control Panel will be located in the Main Telecommunication Room; \nMain Fire Alarm Annunciator Panel will be located at the main south entrance. \nNo fire phones will be provided. \nIn-suite notification devices will a speaker/strobe combination device capable of \nbroadcasting a mass notification message; note that suite signaling will include \na speaker circuit dedicated to the suites (per floor) and a separate speaker circuit (per \nfloor) dedicated to common areas. \nSmoke detectors will be used in all suites and connected to the main fire alarm \nsystem. \nThe fire alarm system will also be interconnected into the campus wide FM Net system \nand Mass Notification System. \nThe network connection will be at the FACP, not the annunciator. The FAAP will be a \nstandard transponder interface annunciator only. It will require a dedicated 120V \ncircuit, and will consist of an 8-line display, remote microphone, control switches for \npaging and bypasses, and a spare tub for mounting a graphic.  FACP will include the \nsame functionality (display, microphone, switches, graphic, etc.). \n  East Campus Village 9 Student Housing \nDesign Development Report \n  DESIGN DEVELOPMENT REPORT – JUNE 9, 2016   \n99 \nLOW TENSION SYSTEMS \nThis section of the report discusses the various low tension and security systems that \nare envisioned to be installed in the East Campus Village 9 Residence. \nSecurity Systems \nSecurity design discussions to date have been captured below but will also require \nfurther review after a CPTED review is completed.   \nAccess Control System \nAt the present, the project will allow for the installation of conduit and cabling system \ncomplete with all necessary power supplies.

exploring the use of a high efficiency Photo Voltaic system that would be tied directly into the main distribution for the building. The amount of available flat roof area is limited, therefore we \nare considering high efficiency modules ranging between 340w to 360w per module. This will maximize the power output per square foot. The overall output of the system will depend on the \navailable roof area. Currently we are planning for a system between 60kW and 80kW. The modules will be collected through 4 to 6 inverters and terminated a dedicated solar panelboard located at \nthe roof level. The modules will be self-ballasted, thus will require no mechanical connection to the roof. The existing cast in place concrete design will accommodate all dead loads from the panels.  \n  East Campus Village 9 Student Housing \nDesign Development Report \n  DESIGN DEVELOPMENT REPORT – JUNE 9, 2016   \n12.0 APPENDIX A – GREEN GLOBES – (PRE-DESIGN SURVEY) \nAttachment 2\n  East Campus Village 9 Student Housing \nDesign Development Report \n  DESIGN DEVELOPMENT REPORT – JUNE 9, 2016   \n13.0 APPENDIX B – ELECTRICAL CUT SHEETS \nS5R-S7R_3.31.16 04/16 page 1 of 4\nProject: \nLocation: \nCat.No: \nType: \nLamps:  Qty: \nNotes: \nFeatures\n1.

Ideal for new construction \nand retrofit applications in T5 and T8 lengths. Ideal for uplight and downlight in commercial, retail, \nmanufacturing, warehouse, cove and display applications.\nCONSTRUCTION — Compact-design channel and cover are formed from code-gauge, cold-rolled steel. \nImproved easy \"snap 'n' lock\" end plates allow for quick attachment.\nFinish: Paint options include high-gloss, baked white enamel (WH), galvanized (GALV), matte black \n(MB) and smoke gray (SKGY). Five-stage iron phosphate pre-treatment ensures superior paint adhesion \nand rust resistance.\nOPTICS — Replaceable medium diffuse lens (up to 10%) offer ingress protection from debris.\nELECTRICAL — Utilizes high-output LEDs integrated on a two-layer circuit board, ensuring cool-running \noperation. Internal pluggable wiring harness prevents wiring errors. Electronic LED driver is rated for 75 \ninput watts maximum (see Operational Data on page two for actual wattage consumption), multi-volt \ninput and 0-10V dimming standard. This fixture is designed to withstand a maximum line surge of \n1.5kV at 0.75kA combination wave for indoor locations, for applications requiring higher level of protec-\ntion additional surge protection must be provided.\nLEDs provide 83 CRI at 3000 K, 3500 K,4000 K or 5000 K.\nLumen output ranges from 2100 to 6000 lumens. Beam angle is 110 FWHM (full width at half maximum).\nLumen output up to 1,300 lumens per foot. In 86°F (30°C) ambient environments, L70 is predicted to \nbe  100,000+ hours, L85 at 44,000 hours. Luminaire should be installed in applications where ambient \ntemperatures do not exceed 86°F (30°C). Ambient temperatures that exceed 86°F (30°C) will result in \nreduced life and will void warranty.\nINSTALLATION — Tool-less channel cover for easy installation.\nFixture may be surface, pendant or stem mounted. Three-point aligner locks in place for easy continuous \nrow mounting.\nLISTINGS — UL Listed. CSA certified to US and Canadian safety standards. For use in damp locations \nbetween -4°F (-20°C) and 86°F (30°C).\nWARRANTY — 5-year limited warranty.

Please circle the descriptions below that best portrays you:\n2. If you chose “Other” above, please let us know about yourself\nNone\n3. Please check the age category that you are in.\n1 \nAttachment 2\n4. How did you hear about this open house? \n5. Did the material that was presented help you understand what the Lister 5 and East \nCampus Village 9 student housing projects are? \n6. Did the material that was presented help you understand the proposed preliminary \ndesign for Lister 5 and East Campus Village 9? \n2 \nThe following questions relate specifically to the Lister 5 student housing project: \n7. Please comment on your impressions regarding Board #4 and the preliminary \ndesign for Lister 5: \n• Design is okay. \n• Appreciate the lower height and \"bowtie\" design. Appreciate the breaking up \nof the massing of the long walls with glassed areas looking outside. \n• The open space is appreciated and the large window design. It is important \nthat the kitchen be equipped with a stove and a microwave as to encourage \nmore healthy cooking habits and community building. \n• This design is better than another tall tower. Given that there is a condo \nbuilding on 87th Ave and 117 St and there will be another apartment building \ngoing up on that corner, the University should be talking to the City to \nimprove the pedestrian crossing at this corner. Students will be crossing at \nthis intersection and travelling by bike to the U and improved safety at this \ncrossing is important. \n• We like the proposed design: it is not too tall, the proposed color tone will go \nwith Mary Schaffer Hall when viewed from a distance, the sidewalk on south \nside provides access to the LRT and the ground front windows provide \"eyes \non the street\" for safety. \n• I like the low-rise, as long as there is preserved paved path to the LRT. \n8. Please provide comments on the design principles as applied to the proposed \ndesign on Boards #5 and #6: \n• Good application of design principles, like the active street level. Color shown \non boards is too light - too grey - snow/winter color prefer red ? or bright \ncolored panels to brighten things up in the winter \n• Very appealing visually. \n• Pedestrian principles/cycling principles - this is a very busy area of campus. \nThe addition of another residence will require the University to work with the \nCity of Edmonton to improve traffic flow and crossings at busy intersections \n(at 87th Ave and 117 St). This includes providing parking services staff to be \n\"on-site\" and actively managing traffic flow into the U particularly when there \nare one or more large activities going on at the Butterdome and SUB Mall. \nThis should include barriers around parking areas to stop cars from short \ncutting and parking in \"No Parking\" areas of neighbouring areas, particularly \nWindsor Park. \n• Elevations look good. \n• I like the design with the open social spaces and the kitchen on the main \nfloor. \n9. Please provide any further comments about the Lister 5 student housing project: \n• We are concerned about noise, dust, vibrations and heavy trucks during \nthe lengthy construction period. We need good liaison between university, \nconstruction company and neighborhood. May also be concern for \npatients and employees at Cross Cancer Institute. \n• I'm very pleased there will be a walkway east to west from/to Health \nSciences Station and the Windsor Park Community. \n• The University also needs to consider that students staying in residence \ndo have cars and they have friends and family who visit them. Students \nwith cars, who live in residence, should be encouraged to buy a parking \npass at the University, so they have a place to park their cars. They \nshould also be informed about where their guests can and cannot park \nand given detailed information about the parking restrictions in Windsor \nPark and the consequences of parking there illegally. \n• If executed as proposed, it will look good. It is essential to maintain easy \naccess from 117 St to the LRT as proposed. We realize that reducing \n3 \nparking is likely to cause additional illegal parking on neighborhood streets \nso the university should ensure that students with cars park on campus. \n• I like the washroom design where the showers and toilets are separated \non each half, because I think it's more hygienic. \nThe following questions relate specifically to the East Campus Village 9 student \nhousing project: \n10. Please comment on your impressions regarding Board #8 and the preliminary \ndesign for East Campus Village 9: \n• Good - doesn't affect us directly. \n• The social space is a tremendous factor in encouraging students to \nappreciate the community spirit. \n• Please consider tying East Campus Village into utili ? \n• It looks good but rent for the 6 bedroom units needs to be cheap enough to \njustify having to live with so many people. \n11. Please provide comments on the design principles and architectural concepts on \nBoards #9 and #10: \n• I think it's important that the north/south walkways in East Campus be \nimproved to help to increase movement between the buildings. There also \nneeds to be improvements to night time lighting and safety features to make \nit fell less scary. \n12. Please provide any further comments about the East Campus Village 9 student \nhousing project: \n• Very approving of the 6-unit housing think it will be great for campus \ncommunity. Nice design as well. \n• I think additional student consultation needs to be done, an open house has \nnever been held for students living in East Campus Village area who will be \nmost affected by this project. Lister had an open for their project and it was \nvery successful. We deserve the same style of consultation. The existing \nfurniture in residence is very low quality, it's important that the units are \nfurnished with high quality furniture. This includes things like sturdy tables \nand comfortable couches and chairs. \n• The bedroom doors need to be designed with deadbolt or similar style doors \nthat make it impossible to lock your keys inside the bedroom. Current doors \nare designed so this is possible and it means that students are constantly \nlocking their keys in their rooms. Full sized reliable fridges and freezers are \nvery important. Internet access in each room should be available through an \nEthernet connection as well as UWS because UWS is unreliable and doesn't \nwork with devices like game consoles. It's important that social spaces are \nfurnished adequately to encourage use, build community and reduce social \nisolation. Details like ventilation and lighting are important, current residences \ncan be dark and not comfortably ventilated requiring the student to buy their \nown fan and lights. It's very important that each room has a doorbell, \nbecause with multi-floor apartments it will be impossible to hear someone \nknocking at the front door if you are in your bedroom. This is key to building \ncommunity as well as ensuring staff can make it known when they are \nentering the unit.\" \n4 \nItem No. 8 \nGFC FACILITIES DEVELOPMENT COMMITTEE  \nFor the Meeting of June 23, 2016 \n OUTLINE OF ISSUE \nAgenda Title: Devonian Botanic Garden (DBG):  Sector Plan  \nItem  \nAction Requested Approval Recommendation  Discussion/Advice  Information \nProposed by Ben Louie, University Architect, Planning and Project Delivery, Facilities \nand Operations \nPresenter Ben Louie, University Architect, Planning and Project Delivery, Facilities \nand Operations; Lee Foote, Director, Devonian Botanic Garden, Faculty \nof Agricultural, Life and Environmental Sciences \nSubject Devonian Botanic Garden (DBG) Sector Plan \nDetails \nResponsibility Vice-President (Facilities and Operations)  \nThe Purpose of the Proposal is \n(please be specific) \nTo provide members an update on the work-in-progress of Devonian \nBotanic Garden (DBG) Sector Plan which will be brought forward fall \n2016 for formal submission.  \nThis sector plan will establish management direction for resource \nstewardship, operations and development.

It identifies how university lands and facilities should be \ndeveloped over a 30 year horizon and outlines initiatives and direction towards appropriate and \neffective growth and development.  \nThe university uses sector plans and the LRDP to guide future planning and determine if individual \nprojects are consistent with the directions and guidelines provided.  The character and physical quality \nof each sector of the university is determined, influenced and shaped by various components.  These \ncomponents dictate the recognition and organization of an individual sector “pattern”. \nSector plans identify: \n1) Potential development and redevelopment sites that address faculty, university services and other \nexpansion requirements; \n2) Outline guidelines for effective and compatible development and redevelopment activities within \nand between each sector; and \n3) Identify the required physical linkages to adjacent sectors and the interface with adjacent \nneighbours and university partners.  \nA sector plan provides the next level of detail of an integrated land use plan.  It establishes building \nzones, not actual buildings.  Land use is further refined with the identification of paths, gateways, \nnodes, edges, landmarks and districts.  It also guides the treatment and maintenance of existing site \nfeatures, future site improvements, pedestrian and vehicular circulation and develops a unified and \ncohesive sector and campus character that addresses the future needs based on Smart Growth and \nSustainable Development Principles.   \nDevonian Botanic Garden (DBG) is about 30 kilometres south west of Edmonton. At over 240 acres (97 \nhectares), it is part of the Devon Dunes and is representative of the former shore of glacial Lake \nEdmonton. It is primarily a sandy soil profile with a high water table and a highly sensitive aquifer.    \nThe ecological integrity and biodiversity of the site may be more susceptible to impacts due to its \nrelatively small size and the intensity of surrounding residential development.  Moving forward, \nmaintaining connectivity with adjacent natural habitats like Bunchberry Meadows Conservation Area \nmay be beneficial in preserving ecological integrity and biodiversity. \nIn the last five years, the garden has challenged the paradigm of simply maintaining and displaying a \nwell-organized collection of living and preserved plants. During the 2012 - present period, it has put on \na focus of revenue generation. DBG has been further challenged with simultaneous growth in garden \nscope with the gift of a major new Islamic Garden, a proposed Ecological Learning Centre, revised \nentryway plan and utility upgrade requirements.  In addition, a recent acquisition of 20 hectares (50 \nacres) including a dwelling of architectural importance and alterations in land use around its periphery \nwould potentially affect land use patterns.  \nThe initial mandate of the garden (botanic collections and education) can benefit by moving from the \nmarginally capitalized operation to a large scale, multi-dimensional operation.  Botanic gardens may \nAttachment 1 \nBen Louie, University Architect                                   Page 2 of 2                                                June 23, 2016 \nexpand their scope, disciplinary boundaries and support without losing their plant-basis. Cultural, \nhistoric, architectural, medical, experiential and artistic elements can be sensitively incorporated into \nthe DBG to attract a much broader viewership and participation. The long-term viability of DBG’s \ncollections is better insured by showing strong societal and university relevance beyond just the \ngardening community. \nIssues \nCurrently, DBG does not have a sector plan to guide its site management and development. \nThis land use plan will establish management direction for resource stewardship, operations and \ndevelopment.  It will have the broad objective of safeguarding the land base's important natural and \ncultural features, while providing continued opportunities for managing future development \nopportunities.   \nThe plan will guide the management of the park for a 15-year period and establish the policy framework \nand management direction for DBG. \nBuilding on the base of the botanic garden components, the sector plan can embrace new spheres of \nuniversity-compatible activities.  This will broaden the meaning and relevance of DBG to a much larger \nsegment of society and academia.  It will help ensure and enliven the future of the garden. This will \nrequire a certain flexibility and tolerance for change that should come with time.  \nAs a learning landscape, DBG can enhance the academic experience and attract exceptional talent. \nThe garden will be a model of sustainable development, promoting responsible management that \nmeets current needs and will position the university to respond to future generations. \nFour phases in the process have been completed.  \n1) Data gathering and analysis; \n2) Imagining the future; \n3) Conceptual development; and \n4) Engagement with stakeholders and community. \nRecommendation \nThe plan is currently being consolidated and will be completed by this summer. Concurrently, portions \nof the sector plan, including infrastructural / utilities upgrades are scheduled to be implemented \nbeginning in 2016.

Since it’s inception in 1959, the Garden has evolved \ngreatly both in it’s size and program offerings. Gardens such as \nthe Japanese Garden, Alpine Garden, and Primula Dell,  offer \nbeautiful exhibitions of garden styles and plant species, while the \nImrie Wetland and nature trails provide an experience unique to \nGarden’s landscape. Research has been a cornerstone of activities \nat the Garden, with strong connections to the University faculties \nand continuing education programs. Currently, there are many \nplans in place to transform the Garden through the development of \nnew facilities, world-class gardens, and expanded programming. \nRecent land acquisitions to the south of the garden, coupled with \nambitious goals for increased visitation, have made the time right for \naddressing long-term planning that will help achieve a new vision for \nGarden. \nThe Sector Plan for the Garden is intended to integrate new current \nplanned developments, including the Islamic Garden, Ecological \nLearning Centre, and water treatment facility, into a comprehensive \nplan for the Garden’s future. It identifies existing assets and provides \ndirection for enhancements and new programs that are integrative \nand complementary. New types of gardens are imagined that are \ninspired by the natural landscape. Broader audiences are identified \nand addressed through new experiences and exhibits tailored to \nspecific desires such as children programming and nature-based \nprogramming. Ongoing requirements such as maintenance, parking \nand access, are addressed. \nThe Plan provides a comprehensive overview of current conditions, \nboth cultural and ecological. This assessment has informed the \ndefinition of the Districts, which are introduced in Section 3: \nCharacter Districts. Opportunities and issues are identified for \neach District in this section. Section 4: The Future Garden and \nDevelopment Guidelines set forward broad concepts and strategic \ninterventions to achieve the Garden’s vision. These are based on \nthe key concepts of nodes, landmarks, gateways, and connections. \nThe final section of the plan outlines implementation strategies over \nshort, medium, long term growth projections. \nChange is constant. This is especially evident at the Garden, where \nseasons and time impact the experience of the place on a day-to-\nday basis. Priorities and plans also change. The Sector Plan has \nbeen developed to identify key opportunities and development \nstrategies that will ultimately help the Garden achieve the vision it \nhas established. It is a flexible plan that by design can respond to \nnew directions, funding, and external influences, while supporting \nthe Garden’s and the University’s broader goals. \nDR\nAF\nT\nExecutive Summary\nDR\nAF\nT\nDR\nAF\nT\n| \nu\nn\niv\ne\nr\ns\nit\ny\n o\nf\n a\nl\nb\ne\nr\nta\n  D\nev\non\nia\nn \nBo\nta\nni\nc \nG\nar\nde\nn \nM\nas\nte\nr P\nla\nn\n7\n 1.0 Introduction\nDR\nAF\nT\nIn June 2002, the Board of Governors of the University of Alberta \nadopted a Long Range Development Plan for the University, \nestablishing a vision for shaping and guiding future growth, \ndevelopment and redevelopment at the four Edmonton campus sites \nof the University (North Campus, South Campus, Michener Park and \nFaculté Saint-Jean) to the year 2030. Subsequently, in May 2005, \nthe Board of Governors of the University of Alberta adopted a Long \nRange Development Plan (LRDP) for the Augustana Campus. The \nLRDP provides a flexible set of strategic planning principles that \nsupport the growth of new research, teaching and student support \nfacilities. The LRDP identifies how University lands and facilities \nshould be developed, and outlines operational planning principles, \ninitiatives and guidelines that direct appropriate and sustainable \ngrowth for the University. \nThe LRDP’s principles, initiatives and guidelines recognize the \nexisting unique characteristics and attributes of the University and \npromote future development that:\n o Fosters desirable Campus life.\n o Supports teaching and research.\n o Uses physical and financial resources efficiently and \neffectively.\n o Creates, preserves and enhances significant physical assets \nfor the University.\n o Provides the flexibility to respond to future trends and growth.\n o Recognizes and values the planning initiatives of its \nneighbours and partners.\nWithin the Campus sites, 19 Sectors have been identified — 11 \nSectors within the North Campus, 3 Sectors within the South \nCampus, 2 Sectors in Michener Park, 1 Sector at each of Faculté \nSaint-Jean, Augustana Faculty and the Devonian Botanical Garden. \nThe University has identified the need to establish specific Sector \nPlans for each of these Sectors. This document specifically \naddresses Sector 20, the Augustana Campus in Camrose, Alberta. \n(Refer to Figure 1). The purposes for the Sector Plans are:\n o To develop a vision for development and redevelopment \ncompatible with the principles of the LRDP.\n o To identify potential development and redevelopment sites \nthat address Faculty, University services and other expansion \nrequirements.\n o To outline guidelines for effective and compatible \ndevelopment and redevelopment activities within and \nbetween Sectors.\n o To identify the required physical links to adjacent Sectors \nand the interface with adjacent neighbours and University \npartners.\n 1.1 Purpose of a Sector Plan\nDR\nAF\nT\n| \nu\nn\niv\ne\nr\ns\nit\ny\n o\nf\n a\nl\nb\ne\nr\nta\n  D\nev\non\nia\nn \nBo\nta\nni\nc \nG\nar\nde\nn \nM\nas\nte\nr P\nla\nn\n9\nThe LRDP and Sector Plans are important components that guide \nplanning and development for the University. This document has \nbeen created for use by the University of Alberta and its design, \nplanning and programming consultants and the construction \nindustry. These plans are based on extensive public and faculty \nparticipation and evaluation, and approval by University governance. \nThe University, through the office of the University Architect, will \nuse the Sector Plans, in conjunction with the LRDP, to assess future \nplanning and development initiatives within each Sector and to \ndetermine if individually proposed development or redevelopment \nprojects comply with the directions and guidelines provided. \nInterpretation of these plans is the responsibility of the office of the \nUniversity Architect.\nThe university uses sector plans, in conjunction with the Long \nRange Development Plan, to assist future planning and development \ninitiatives within each sector and determine if individual development \nor redevelopment projects are consistent with the directions and \nguidelines provided.\nThe character and physical qualities of each of the University \nof Alberta Campuses are determined and influenced by various \ncomponents. The visual quality or legibility of these components \ndictates the organization and recognition of a coherent, liveable \nCampus through distinct Sector ‘patterns’. Legibility is a crucial \nconcept in the structuring of a coherent Sector ‘pattern’. A legible \nSector is one where districts (areas exhibiting a recognizable and \ncommon character), landmarks (reference points), nodes (focal \npoints), edges (natural and built boundaries) and pathways (urban \nchannels – roads, walkways, public transit, bicycle routes, etc.) \nare easily identified and grouped into an overall ‘pattern’. (Refer \nto Figure 3). These pattern elements structure and harmonize the \nenvironment, establishing and clarifying points of entry, movement, \nvisual reference, ambient character, and social space – in short, \nthey create a ‘sense of place’. In order to create a distinctive ‘sense \nof place’ for each University Campus and Sector, it is important to \nestablish comprehensive, implementable guidelines that identify, and \nrespond to the existing and potential interaction between pattern \nelements. A ‘sense of place’ is physically and cognitively created \nthrough these pattern elements. In more detail, these are:\nDistricts: Areas having a typical character and/or land use based \non a combination of elements such as: culture, history, built-form, \nnatural areas or specific social activity.\nPathways: Key vehicular (public, public transit, service-oriented), \npedestrian and multi-use (e.g. bicycles) routes and their spatial \nqualities (e.g. landscape treatment and way-finding systems).\nEdges: Natural boundaries (e.g. a ravine or shelterbelt) and built form \nboundaries (i.e. the density, massing, setback and façade treatment \nof buildings; key roadway boundaries and seams; and streetscape \nfeatures – treed boulevards, lighting, furnishings, etc.).\nNodes: Nodes are strategic focal points, typically pathway \nintersections or areas where activities are concentrated. They can be \nsmall points or large areas and in any shape. They are critical points \nfor way-finding, social interaction, and aesthetic quality.\nLandmarks: Important built or natural features that are easily \nidentifiable. Landmarks are objects or areas of significance to the \noverall character and identity of an area. They can become guides in \na system of way-markers. \nThe current flexible space in the garden \nis used extensively for kids camps and \nunstructured and structured play\n 1.2 Plan Structure and Format\nDR\nAF\nT\nA Vision for the  \nDevonian Botanic Garden\nThe Devonian Botanic Garden will be an internationally recognized \ninstitution offering authentic garden experiences rooted in a unique \nnatural and cultural landscape. The garden will inspire appreciation \nfor nature, interdisciplinary research, academic scholarship, and \nexperiential learning. Building on the garden’s heritage, the future \nDevonian Botanic Garden will connect to broader audiences \nthrough new and refined collections, appropriate complimentary \nexpansion and year round programs.DR\nAF\nT\n| \nu\nn\niv\ne\nr\ns\nit\ny\n o\nf\n a\nl\nb\ne\nr\nta\n  D\nev\non\nia\nn \nBo\nta\nni\nc \nG\nar\nde\nn \nM\nas\nte\nr P\nla\nn\n11\nInterdisciplinary Academic Research \nfor Scholarship and Engagement\nWe continue to advance and support the Academic Plans and \nmission of the University and of the faculties. \nConservation of the Natural and \nCultural Environment\nThe garden’s stunning natural setting provides the overall framework \nfor the visitor experience and the garden’s identity. Its conservation \nis paramount to support the continuity of the garden’s heritage.\nExperiential Learning\nEducational programs for people of all ages and abilities \nimmerse students in the landscape and laboratories, creating a \nconnection with plants and natural systems. The garden will use \nnew technologies to further connect visitors with the landscape, \nintegrating digital practices and infrastructure into the overall \nexperience.\nResponsive to Transportation  \nDemand Management\nSafe and efficient access to the garden will be accomplished \nthrough multiple modes of transportation. On-site parking supports \nincreased daily visitation numbers and special events are managed \nsafely and efficiently. The garden experience is choreographed from \nthe moment of arrival.\nFiscally Responsible  \nand Operationally Viable\nVisitors will experience a facility where operational costs and \nmaintenance requirements are ingrained within the planning and \ndesign process, ensuring the garden remains viable as facilities \nchange and expand.\nSustainable Landscape Strategies\nConnected intimately with nature, the garden will exemplify \napproaches to development and resource management that \nenhance and foster understanding between people and natural \nsystems.\nConnected\nConnected to the broader landscape through a coherent and \ncontiguous ecological network and system of trails and pathways. \nConnected to the broader cultural region through strategic \npartnerships that will reach new audiences and raise the garden’s \nprofile. Connected to the University, supporting its academic mission \nand off-campus activities. Connected with our communities as good \nneighbours and as good stewards. \nYear Round Programming\nThe garden will expand to offer quality programming throughout the \nyear, celebrating its northern climate by embracing all four seasons.\n 1.4 Guiding Principles\nDR\nAF\nT\nDR\nAF\nT\n 2.0 Existing Conditions\nDR\nAF\nT\nThe Garden is 35km southwest of the City of Edmonton, Alberta’s \ncapital city. The steady growth of Edmonton coupled with that of the \nCounty, Leduc and other areas are expanding the population nearby \nto the Garden. Other influences on development in the area include: \n o The Acheson Industrial Area\n o Sand and gravel extraction \n o Peat harvesting\n o Coal mines and power plants\n o Oil and gas developments\n o Large livestock operations\n2.1.2 Ecological Context\nNatural eco-regions and subregions are landscape categories \nused to classify ecological units at a broad scale in Alberta. They \nare generally defined by landscape patterns delineated by soils, \nvegetation, climate, physiographic features, elevations and latitude. \nParkland County spans two eco-regions: the Aspen Parkland Eco-\nregion and Boreal Transition Eco-region. Within these eco-regions, \nthe County contains three natural subregions: Dry Mixedwood, \nCentral Mixedwood, and Central Parkland, wherein the Garden \nlocated. \n“The Central Parkland Natural Subregion occupies a broad, \nintensively cultivated and heavily populated area in central Alberta. \nIt lies between the cold, snowy northern forests and the warm, dry \nsouthern prairies, sharing the climatic and vegetation characteristics \nof both” (Natural Regions Committee, 2006).\n2.1.1 Regional Context\nThe Devonian Botanic Garden is located within Parkland County, a \nrural municipal district in central Alberta. As of the 2011 census, the \nCounty population was 30,568 people (Statistics Canada, 2011). \nBetween 2006 and 2011, the County has experienced steady growth \nof 4.6% and the population is expected to grow to up to 50,000 by \n2044 (Capital Region Board, 2013). This growth is primarily focused \nin the centres of Stony Plain and Spruce Grove. The Town of Leduc, \njust outside of the County boundary, but just 30km southeast of the \nGarden, has also experienced significant population growth over the \npast 10 years - it’s population rising from 16,967 in 2006 to 29,304 in \n2015 (Statistics Canada, 2015). \nEdmonton City \nLimits\nNorth \nSaskatchewan \nRiver\nH\nig\nhw\nay\n 2\nH\nig\nhw\nay\n 6\n0\nHighway 16\nUniversity of Alberta \nNorth Campus\nDevonian \nBotanic Garden\nParkland County\nDevon\nEdmonton \nInternational \nAirport\nEdmonton City \nLimits\nDevonian Botanic \nGarden\nParkland County\nN\n 2.1 Context and Study Area\nDR\nAF\nT\n| \nu\nn\niv\ne\nr\ns\nit\ny\n o\nf\n a\nl\nb\ne\nr\nta\n  D\nev\non\nia\nn \nBo\nta\nni\nc \nG\nar\nde\nn \nM\nas\nte\nr P\nla\nn\n15\nThe Devonian Botanic Garden is located at the \nsoutheast corner of  Parkland County (far left)\nThe Devonian Botanic Garden is located north  \nthe town of Devon, close to Edmonton and the \nEdmonton International Airport and accessed off of \nHighway 60 (left, other page)\nNorth of the town of Devon and the North \nSaskatchewan River, and sandwiched between the \nClifford E.

Provincially, \nthree species have primary ranges within the Central Parkland: \nthe Prairie vole, Franklin’s ground squirrel, and the Piping Plover \n(Natural Regions Committee, 2006). The Piping Plover is considered \nEndangered according to Schedule 1 of the Species at Risk Act \n(SARA)1 (Government of Canada, 2002).\n2.1.3 Study Area\nNative plant communities in the area include treed and shrubby fens \n(marshy areas); willow thickets; and balsam poplar and jack pine \nforests. Natural areas of the garden support high faunal diversity \nincluding numerous insects, mammals and birds. Two conservation \nareas, Clifford E. Lee Natural Area and Bunchberry Meadows \nConservation Area, are situated close to the garden, increasing the \nimportance of the Devonian Botanic Garden as a habitat corridor.\nThe Devonian Botanic Garden features 80 acres of display gardens, \n50 acres of the Dyde Estate, on which sits the Dyde House, and an \nadditional 110 acres of natural areas and ecological preserves in the \nsouthern portion of the site.DR\nAF\nT\n| \nu\nn\niv\ne\nr\ns\nit\ny\n o\nf\n a\nl\nb\ne\nr\nta\n  D\nev\non\nia\nn \nBo\nta\nni\nc \nG\nar\nde\nn \nM\nas\nte\nr P\nla\nn\n16\n2.2.1 Climate\nThe area has a humid continental climate characterized by large \nseasonal temperature differences, with warm to hot summers \nand cold winters.

It is the former shore of glacial \nLake Edmonton. Sandy soils and high water table characterize this \narea, as well as a highly sensitive aquifer.\nThis translates to very distinct topography throughout the Garden. \nSmall rises, shallow valleys, open wetlands characterize the terrain. \nMany gardens such as the Japanese Garden, the Alpine Garden, \nand the Primula Dell utilize the native topography to create distinct \nexhibits and define edges. \nHummocky uplands and undulating till plains are the dominant \nlandforms in the Central Parkland Subregion.

Balsam \npoplar or white spruce forests can be found in moist rich sites and \npoorly drained wetlands are often comprised of marshes, shrublands \nor fens.\n2.2.3 Drainage\nThe Garden and associated land are typical of these conditions, \nwhere many well drained areas of sandy soil exist along with poorly \ndrained sites. Dune landforms create a patchwork of pine forest \nwithin a broader matrix of low-lying wet areas. The terrain generally \nfalls from the north to the south with an overall grade change of \napproximately 5m and a difference in elevation of approximately \n17m from the highest to the lowest point. \n 2.2 Environmental Conditions\n Above: Aquifer (above)\n Soil deposits within the Devonian Botanic Garden (left)\n Temperature and Precipitation Chart for 1971 to 2000  \n Canadian Climate Normals for Edmonton Woodbend  \n Weather Station (Data from Environment Canada,  \n accessed July 23, 2015) (far left)\nDR\nAF\nT\n| \nu\nn\niv\ne\nr\ns\nit\ny\n o\nf\n a\nl\nb\ne\nr\nta\n  D\nev\non\nia\nn \nBo\nta\nni\nc \nG\nar\nde\nn \nM\nas\nte\nr P\nla\nn\n17\nWater\nDisturbed\nGrassland\nHighway 60 To DevonTo Edmonton\nVehicular Entrance\nHigh Point\n Generalized Drainage Flow\nLow Point\n695.93 712.33\nForest Canopy and Elevation Overlay\n o The Garden is characterized by the Devon Dunes - landforms \nresultant from pre-glacial sand dune formations.

Along the west edge, \nHighway 22A is a major vehicular corridor, while the north south and \neast edges are primarily natural, yet fenced. In some cases, there is \nlow-density residential development close to the edge.  \nThe west edge of DBG is the face of the garden for visitors. When \napproaching from the south, visitors see a visible fence and, in many \ncases, power lines. However, fencing is required not only for security \nreasons, but to prevent wildlife entering the garden collections area \nand feeding on the rare plants. \nThe west edge is also a high generator of noise. Noise from vehicles \nand trucks permeate the site. Additionally, in the northwest corner, \nvisitors can see traffic along Highway through patches of sparse \nvegetation. The east edge fence is well hidden from visitors and \nintegrated nicely into a vegetative screen. Additionally, there is \nample room for service vehicle routes. Lastly, the southern edge of \nthe site is not accessible to visitors and hidden from site. \nGateways\nGateways, or entry points, are an important feature for welcoming \nand wayfinding, indicating the transition into a different space \nand a landmarks for the entire site. The DBG is the northernmost \nbotanic garden in Canada. Consequently, the primary vehicular and \npedestrian gateway should showcase an importance and distinct \ncharacter; acting as attractor to passersby as well acting as a \nlandmark for visitors. \nCurrently, DBG’s gateway and vehicular approach is uncelebrated. \nWhen approaching the DBG from the south, vehicles must come \nto an abrupt slowing speed to enter the garden. While the garden’s \nsignage is at a high elevation, tree cover tends to prevent a clear \ndirect line of sight when approaching. In addition, the right hand \nturning lane is short and becomes congested during high peak \nvisiting hours.\nApproaching the garden from the north (Edmonton), visitors must \nconfront an uncontrolled left hand turn. Vehicular queuing can \nbecome backed-up during high peak visiting hours, especially when \nbuses are dropping of large groups, such as school groups. \nThe garden does not currently provide a pedestrian gateway. A \npedestrian gateway will need to be integrated into the new sector \nplan and will be inherently tied to the development of the Prospector \nTrail.  \nN\nCountry residential\nHighway \nNo development\n 2.4 Gateways + Edges\n Edge influence on site\nDR\nAF\nT\n| \nu\nn\niv\ne\nr\ns\nit\ny\n o\nf\n a\nl\nb\ne\nr\nta\n  D\nev\non\nia\nn \nBo\nta\nni\nc \nG\nar\nde\nn \nM\nas\nte\nr P\nla\nn\n21\n Highway 60 Edge with sightlines, determined by  \n layering sightlines and topographic data (top); \n Fence line along the property boundary (bottom left).\n Northern edge of Garden at the Grebe Pond (middle top);  \n Main entry (middle left);  \n North edge of the Garden (middle right).\n South boundary of the Garden (right bottom);  \n North parking area (right top).\nDR\nAF\nT\n| \nu\nn\niv\ne\nr\ns\nit\ny\n o\nf\n a\nl\nb\ne\nr\nta\n  D\nev\non\nia\nn \nBo\nta\nni\nc \nG\nar\nde\nn \nM\nas\nte\nr P\nla\nn\n22\nThe DBG has an abundance of landmarks which act as a interpretive \nfeatures as well as aide in visitor wayfinding.\nThe major infrastructural landmarks are:\n o The entrance kiosk\n o Showroom and greenhouses\n o Kurimoto Japanese Gardens Gateway \n o The Tower\n o Pine Pavilion\n o Oil Well Interpretive Feature\n o Washroom Facility\n o Dyde House\nThe major environmental landmarks are: \n o Calla Pond\n o Grebe Water\n o Imrie Wetland Reserve\nThe infrastructural landmarks within the site are an important feature \nbecause they help visitors locate themselves within the abundance \nand complexity of the different gardens. \n The primary node at the DBG is the entrance plaza, where the \nadmission kiosk and cafe are located. \nAnother important node and gathering space is the pine pavilion and \nwedding plaza. \nN\nI M R I E \nW E T L A N D \nR E S E R V E\nH\nI\nG\nH\nW\nA\nY\n6\n0\nArthur Erickson \nHeritage Building\n“Dyde House”\nMillie Gilbertson \nGazebo\nPublic  \nParking Lot\nMain Garden\nEntry\nInterpretive \nCentre\nShowhouses, Offices \n+ Classrooms\nWashroom + \nMaintenance Shed\nMaintenance Shed \n+ Staff Room\nCaretaker’s \nResidence\nWetland Lookout\nNature Hut\nMonkey House\nTower\nOzawa Pavilion\nPine Pavilion\nDavid \nThompson \nHouse\n 2.5 Nodes + Landmarks\n Existing facilities in main garden areaDR\nAF\nT\n| \nu\nn\niv\ne\nr\ns\nit\ny\n o\nf\n a\nl\nb\ne\nr\nta\n  D\nev\non\nia\nn \nBo\nta\nni\nc \nG\nar\nde\nn \nM\nas\nte\nr P\nla\nn\n23\nN\nLandmark\nMajor Node\nMinor Node\n Nodes and landmarks within main gardens DR\nAF\nT\n| \nu\nn\niv\ne\nr\ns\nit\ny\n o\nf\n a\nl\nb\ne\nr\nta\n  D\nev\non\nia\nn \nBo\nta\nni\nc \nG\nar\nde\nn \nM\nas\nte\nr P\nla\nn\n24\nIn the southern portion of the site, unmarked dirt trails and \nboardwalk are used. There is a lack of signage to indicate trail \noptions or route planning other than the primary entry sign. \nVisitor parking is centralized in front of the entrance kiosk and cafe. \nBus parking is also located in this area. Staff parking is located \nsouth of the visitor parking, behind the offices and greenhouses and \nshowrooms. \nService vehicle parking is distributed throughout the site. The \nprimary lay-down area for service vehicles is adjacent to the Bryan \nCampbell-Hope Equipment facility. However, service vehicles also \npart at the north part of the site, along the boundary fencing.\nWayfinding\nWayfinding throughout the site is complex. Although there are \ndesignated walks indicated by large trail head signs, signage along \ntrails tends to be confusing. In a number of trail nodes, trail signs \nare missing, creating a confusing wayfinding experience for visitors. \nWith the expansion of the gardens, a clear hierarchy of trails and \nroutes is required to ease the complexity of navigating the numerous \ngardens and refocus the attention on the enjoyment of the flora. \nVisitor circulation within the site is guided by a hierarchal pathway \nsystem. The primary pathway throughout the site is materialized \nby red brick. The red brick pathway acts as a primary circulation \nroute for the garden collections. Wide dirt trails also act as a primary \ncirculation route, shared between pedestrian visitors, golf carts and \nservice vehicles. In some areas, vehicle track marks have created \nrutted pathways which are difficult for pedestrian to traverse. \nAdditionally, there is often a unclear boundary between circulation \nroute and service road. \nIn addition to the primary circulation routes, there are a number of \nsecondary pathways that range in materiality between dark grey \nbrick, mulch and packed dirt throughout the site. Secondary trails \nact as circulation to and from different types of gardens. Navigation \nwithin each garden varies depending on the garden. In some cases, \ngardens are placed adjacent to primary or secondary circulation \nroutes, while in others, there is no clear trail designated and the \nvisitors is left to wander throughout the garden in their own manner.  \nAlthough walking is the primary mode of transportation for visitors \nthroughout the garden, golf carts are also used extensively by tour \ngroups as well as service staff. When golf carts are used on dirt trails \nduring dry, summer months, dust is spread into the air and may \nadversely affect visitors. \nIn a number of locations, specifically one of the trails leading to \nthe Imrie Wetland Reserve boardwalk, large roots have inundated \nthe pathway, hindering accessibility. However, the Imrie Wetland \nReserve boardwalk can be accessed by a number of different \ntrails with safer route options. Boardwalks along the Imrie Wetland \nReserve tend to be narrow and do not provide railings for visitors. \nN\nMain Vehicular\nEntry\nMain Garden\nEntry\nInterpretive \nCentre\nOzawa Pavilion\nCaretaker’s \nResidence\nAlice Mackinnon \nHorticultural Centre\nBryan Campbell-Hope \nEquipment Facility\nMillie Gilbertson \nGazebo\nNature Hut\nArthur Erickson \nHeritage Building\n“Dyde House”\nDavid \nThompson \nHouse\nTower\nPine \nPavilion\nWetland \nLookout\nShowhouses, Offices  \n+ Classrooms\nWashroom + \nMaintenance Shed\nMaintenance Shed  \n+ Staff Room\nMajor Node: \nClear Decision\nMajor Node:  \nUnclear Decision\nPrimary Pedestrian\nSecondary Pedestrian\nBoardwalk\nGateway\n 2.6 Circulation, Parking  \n  + Wayfinding\nDR\nAF\nT\n| \nu\nn\niv\ne\nr\ns\nit\ny\n o\nf\n a\nl\nb\ne\nr\nta\n  D\nev\non\nia\nn \nBo\nta\nni\nc \nG\nar\nde\nn \nM\nas\nte\nr P\nla\nn\n25\nN\nExisting circulation   \nDR\nAF\nT\nDR\nAF\nT\n 3.0 Character Districts\nDR\nAF\nT\nN\n0 25 50 100 150 Metres\nNATURE \nEXPLORATION \nDISTRICT\nGATEWAY \nGARDEN \nDISTRICT\nGARDEN \nCOLLECTIONS \nDISTRICT\nIMRIE \nWETLAND \nDISTRICT\nDYDE HOUSE \nDISTRICT\nDR\nAF\nT\nN\n0 25 50 100 150 Metres\n| \nu\nn\niv\ne\nr\ns\nit\ny\n o\nf\n a\nl\nb\ne\nr\nta\n  D\nev\non\nia\nn \nBo\nta\nni\nc \nG\nar\nde\nn \nM\nas\nte\nr P\nla\nn\n29\nNATURE \nDISCOVERY \nDISTRICT\nThe Garden has developed distinct areas over time as it has evolved \nand acquired additional property. The different natural and cultural \nattributes of these areas contributes to this distinction and to the \ndefinition of a certain character. The Sector Plan has utilized these \ncharacter areas to define Districts across the Garden. These Districts \nassist in the identification of issues and opportunities and the \ndevelopment of appropriate design goals and strategies to preserve \nand enhance their character. \nThe follow sections describe detailed issues and opportunities \nwithin each District. These issues and opportunities form the basis \nfor proposed new developments, connections, amenities, and other \ndesign elements that will collectively contribute to the realization of \nthe Sector Plan Vision. \n 3.1 Character Districts:  \n  Issues + Opportunities\nDR\nAF\nT\n| \nu\nn\niv\ne\nr\ns\nit\ny\n o\nf\n a\nl\nb\ne\nr\nta\n  D\nev\non\nia\nn \nBo\nta\nni\nc \nG\nar\nde\nn \nM\nas\nte\nr P\nla\nn\n30\nThe Gateway Garden District is the new gateway into the Devonian \nBotanic Garden. The existing entrance hosts an abundance of \ndifficulties associated with vehicular accessible and unsafe queuing \ndistances. As a result, a new entrance was proposed to be moved to \nthe current locked gate . The newly proposed entrance would allow \nvehicles to safely enter the garden and utilize the current service \nroad right-of-way.\nKey Features and Opportunities\nCurrently there are a number of back of house operations close to \nthe newly proposed entrance. As a result, redistribution of these \nservices will be a necessity. However, there is also an abundance of \nopportunities to make these types of operations public. For instance, \nthe greenhouses belonging to the Alice McKinnon Horticultural \nCentre  are an exciting opportunity to enhance and become an \neducational tool for the garden. Due to the cold climate, the garden \nhas to grow a high percentage of plants in greenhouses during \nthe winter months to prepare for the spring and summer seasons. \nOpening this procedural operation to the public and creating a \nprogram to inform visitors about the necessities of plant growth in a \ngreen house environment is one potential opportunity posed by the \nreinterpreting the back of house operations.  \nThe Devonian Botanic Garden is a large area. Accessing different \nareas by vehicle is necessary, not only for service vehicles, but \nalso for visitors in the future. The Garden gateway already has \nestablished dirt roads which reach the far east boundary of the site. \nThese existing roads can be enhanced and allow for multiple entry \npoints to the site, catering to visitors who may be visiting the garden \nfor different purposes. \nThe Gateway Garden is unique in its role as a transect. To the north, \nthe curated garden collection showcase rare plants and specific \ngarden themes. Conversely, to the south, the natural landscape \ntakes precedent and existing natural trails are woven throughout the \nforest and marshes. These very different landscape are connected \nby the gateway district and offer different experiences for the \ngarden.     \n1\n3\n4\n6\n5\n7\n2\nAlice McKinnon \nHorticultural Centre\nBryan Campbell-Hope \nEquipment Facility\nH\nI G\nH\nW\nA Y  6 0\n 3.1.1 Gateway Garden District\nChallenges and Considerations\nWith the expansion of the gardenès area and program, there will \nbe more visitors visiting the garden. As a result, parking will be an \nimportant consideration for the gateway district. However, there is \nalso a plethora of natural landscape and marshland within the area. \nA distributed parking plan could reduce impact on the landscape \nwhile still allowing ample space for visitors to park.\nThe prospector trail will eventually connect with the Devonian \nBotanic Garden  and provide a pedestrian route directly into the \ngarden. The prospector trail will need to be routed to the public \nentrance within the gateway garden district. \nOne of the major advantages of the Devonian Botanic Garden is its \nproximity to Highway 60. Highway 60 is a major thoroughfare and \nprovides direct access to the garden. However, traffic along Highway \n60 is noisy and permeates the garden along the west edge. Dense \nvegetation could visually buffer Highway 60 from garden visitors and \nreduce noise.     \nDR\nAF\nT\n| \nu\nn\niv\ne\nr\ns\nit\ny\n o\nf\n a\nl\nb\ne\nr\nta\n  D\nev\non\nia\nn \nBo\nta\nni\nc \nG\nar\nde\nn \nM\nas\nte\nr P\nla\nn\n31\nFen creates an open, expansive \narea beside proposed new vehicular \ngateway\nExisting road weaves through \nservice areas and back-end \noperations including garden \ngreenhouses and the Kurimoto \nJapanese Garden and Ozawa \nPavilion service area. \nDebris piles \nTrailhead into trails throughout \n“Sandy Dyde Nature Area”\nTrailhead indicating access to \nJapanese Garden\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\nNature play area \nSeries of trails leading to the \nDyde House and Primula Dell and \nKurimoto Japanese Garden\n6\n7\n Map Caption\n Photos Caption\nDR\nAF\nT\n| \nu\nn\niv\ne\nr\ns\nit\ny\n o\nf\n a\nl\nb\ne\nr\nta\n  D\nev\non\nia\nn \nBo\nta\nni\nc \nG\nar\nde\nn \nM\nas\nte\nr P\nla\nn\n32\nThe Garden Collections are the curated displays and show gardens \nfor the  Devonian Botanic Garden.

The new gardens should be added to \ncomplement existing gardens and create a curated, educational \nwalking experience for visitors. How gardens transitions between \neach other is an important feature of a botanic garden and create \ndistinct yet connected spaces.\nThe Ecological Learning Centre is an exciting new development at \nthe Devonian Botanic Garden. The new building will be offer a new \ncentral core for the garden’s programming and create a distinct \nlandmark for visitors. Consequently, how the ELC is accessed is an \nimportant consideration for circulation and parking.\nThere needs to be a clear and consistent language in garden \ntreatments and structures, such as planting beds, signage and trail \nmateriality. Currently, a variety of furnishings and garden treatments \ntend to make the garden appear disjointed and unplanned.  \n3\n6\n1\n2\n4\n5\nChallenges and Considerations\nThe most prominent challenge in the Garden Collections District is \nwayfinding. Currently, there are a number of trailheads and signs \nthroughout the garden, however, there is no curated experience. \nA trail hierarchy would help with wayfinding and create a curated \nwalking experience for visitors designed around themes.. In some \nareas, there is confusion regarding service routes and pedestrian \nroutes.\nThe new entrance situated at the Gateway Garden District will alter \nthe progression into the site. How the visitors access the display \ngardens will need to be considered carefully and ensure visitors are \nable to access the display gardens easily and efficiently. Additionally, \nthe area currently serving as the entrance to the garden will be need \nto be reprogrammed and connected with the ELC. \nLastly, there is a lack of facilities in the garden, including washrooms \nand water fountains and eating areas. \n 3.1.2 Garden Collections District\nDR\nAF\nT\n| \nu\nn\niv\ne\nr\ns\nit\ny\n o\nf\n a\nl\nb\ne\nr\nta\n  D\nev\non\nia\nn \nBo\nta\nni\nc \nG\nar\nde\nn \nM\nas\nte\nr P\nla\nn\n33\n8\n9\n11\n1015\n7\n14151617\n19\n20\n18\n12\n13\n11\n3\n6\n8\n9\n10\n7\n1\n2\n4\n5\n14\n15\n16\n17\n19\n20\n18\n13\n12\nOzawa pavilion and Kurimoto \nJapanese Garden service area is \nlocated along existing roadway, \nwhich may need to be relocated if \nvisitor access is moved along this \nroute (with relocated of garden \ngateway).\nDesire line between two bridges. \nZoltai Garden is hidden, quiet and \npeaceful.

Sector Plan for the Devonian Botanic Garden develops a long-\nterm vision for how the garden can continue to grow and evolve \nover the next 20 years to support both the goals of garden and \nUniversity’s broader goals and objectives. \nSince the establishment of the garden, it has undergone steady \ngrowth, expansion, and evolution in both its exhibits and its \nprogramming. Continued growth in attendance combined with the \nacquisition of adjacent land, the impending development of the \nIslamic Garden and future development of the Ecological Learning \nCentre will significantly transform the garden. Through consideration \nof these trends and developments, assessment of current \nconditions, an understanding of the University’s vision and mandate, \nand input from stakeholders and the public, the Plan charts a new \nfuture for the garden to achieve its vision and goals. The functional \ndiagram is a conceptual framework that identifies the ideas and \nopportunities that will guide development over time as resources \nbecome available. \nThe framework addresses the  \nkey guiding principles of the Plan: \n o Interdisciplinary academic research for scholarship and \nengagement\n o Conservation of the natural and cultural environment\n o Experiential learning\n o Sustainable landscape strategies\n o Connected\n o Year round programming\n o Responsive to transportation demand management\n o Fiscally responsible and operationally viable\n 4.1 Overall Concept &  \n  Strategic Interventions:  \n  The Functional Diagram\nDR\nAF\nT\n| \nu\nn\niv\ne\nr\ns\nit\ny\n o\nf\n a\nl\nb\ne\nr\nta\n  D\nev\non\nia\nn \nBo\nta\nni\nc \nG\nar\nde\nn \nM\nas\nte\nr P\nla\nn\n48\n4.1.1 Academic Research\nAs an extension of the University, the Garden offers unique \nopportunities to expand, integrate and evolve academic research \nwithin the broader University community. There are currently strong \nintegrations within the Faculty of Agricultural, Life & Environmental \nSciences with research projects ranging from biodiversity studies, \nwetlands, reclamation, and fungal associations. The Garden also \nprovides support for research activities with key partners such as \nKew Gardens, the Canola Council of Canada and the Prairie and \nNorthern Plant Diversity Centre. Maintaining existing and building \nnew partnerships will bring broader audiences and activities to the \nGarden. New recent projects include an architectural study of Arthur \nErikson’s Dyde House, which draws new faculties to utilize the \nunique resources contained at the Garden. \nLand acquisitions have greatly increased the holdings of the \nUniversity and present opportunities to further integrate research \nactivity at the Garden. The southern parcels contain extensive \nwetlands, dunes, and forested ecosystems that can be utilized for \nresearch projects with the potential of establishing a permanent \nresearch facility to support these activities.  \n4.1.2 Program Expansion & Refinement\nThe Garden has set an ambitious goal of becoming the premiere \ngarden destination in Alberta. It is expected that visitation numbers \nwill increase from its current 90,000 annual visits to 200,000. \nThe Islamic Garden and Ecological Learning Centre are major \ncomponents of current planned expansion and main attractors for \nincreasing visitation. However, these two additions alone will not be \nsufficient to get the Garden to the ultimate visitation goal. DBG will \nneed to encourage current visitors to visit more, attract new garden \ntourists and appeal to new audiences who might not ordinarily \nvisit. In doing so, DBG must increase the frequency of visiting \nopportunities, enhance the quality of current visiting experience and \nlook at ways of extending its season.\nCompared to the achievements of other botanic gardens in the \nCanadian marketplace and given the rising interest in garden \ntourism, there is significant opportunity to increase annual visits \nto DBG, including first time visits, repeat visits, event attendance \nand educational programming. This is further supported by a \ngrowing, educated population in the Edmonton CMA with above \naverage income who are considered to be highly likely to visit a \ngarden attraction. Research into potential markets, garden tourism \nand trends at comparable institutions has highlighted a number of \nopportunities, organized these under the following categories:\n o Building on existing programming\n o Audience development\n o Maximized use of existing property and assets \n o Enhanced visitor experience\n o Extended seasons and operating hours\n o Improved visitor facilities and amenities\n o Widened and more diverse offerings\n o Major new attractions\nBuilding on Existing Programming\nMake Big Bigger: This trend refers to taking events that are done \nwell and are already popular with the visiting public and expanding \nand enhancing them. Fore example, Luminaria is a very successful \nevent in the winter season. Considerable opportunity exists to \nexpand this event from a 3-day occasion into a larger festival. This \ncould include extending the duration of the event, extending the \nlighted pathways to include other areas of the gardens, and/or \nincreasing other activities around the main lighting.\nOne-Off Events Expanded to a Series: Many gardens have built up \nsingle one-off events into a signature event series as part of their \nannual programming. After 3 years, Date Night has been established \nas an important series within DBG’s annual programming. \nOpportunity exists now to build on elements of the Date Night \nprogram by expanding out the more popular activities into their \nown regular series, such as the movie night and amphitheatre \nperformances. \nLeverage the Gardens for Programming Opportunities: DBG \ncurrently offers Japanese cultural programming as an extension of \nthe Kurimoto Japanese Garden experience, however there are a \nnumber of other gardens at DBG and new gardens in development. \nThematic programming based on the other DBG gardens would \ncreate opportunity to draw diverse tastes, interests and audiences. \nEstablish Interdisciplinary Partnerships: In order to diversify, deliver \nand improve the quality of programming, many gardens partner with \nother institutions, corporations, individuals, and artists. The different \nbut complimentary aspect of the partners also creates interest with \nnew audiences that may not ordinarily visit gardens. Opportunity \nexists for DBG to develop relationships with a range of partners \nin order to help enhance existing programming and attract new \naudiences. \nAudience Development \nUniversity of Alberta Students and Faculty: DBG currently has a \ndistinct advantage in targeting a younger audience through its \ninvolvement with the University of Alberta as part of the Faculty of \nAgricultural, Life and Environmental Science (FALES). Additional \nopportunities to connect with other facilities and departments \noutside of FALES also exist. For example, learning and programming \nconnections with the Faculty of Native Studies and the Faculty \nof Arts through language courses such as Arabic. Anthropology \nand History which offers courses in Canadian Studies, a history of \nscience and medicine could also be investigated.\nFirst Nations and Aboriginal Audiences: There is a growing interest \nin First Nations and Aboriginal culture from tourist audiences as \nwell as from indigenous people. The Native People’s Garden – its \nplants (supported by the Herb Garden) and the garden as a venue \n– presents an important opportunity for engaging First Nations and \naboriginal audiences in enjoying, studying, preparing and presenting \naboriginal legends, music and culture, medicine and healing \ntraditions, etc.\nIntergenerational Audiences: While DBG does provide summer \ncamps and birthday parties, additional opportunity exists to \nengage younger and inter-generational audiences by promoting \nDBG to older visitors as a family friendly experience to which they \ncan bring their children and grandchildren for a full day’s outing. \nSchool holiday programming, dedicated children’s gardens, play \nequipment and water features and trails should be explored. These \nfeatures should be located in close proximity to visitor facilities \nsuch as toilets and food services. It may be interesting to consider \nthe wooded areas or bog areas of the DBG as the location of \na children’s garden to add excitement and adventure into the \nexperience.\nDR\nAF\nT\n| \nu\nn\niv\ne\nr\ns\nit\ny\n o\nf\n a\nl\nb\ne\nr\nta\n  D\nev\non\nia\nn \nBo\nta\nni\nc \nG\nar\nde\nn \nM\nas\nte\nr P\nla\nn\n49\nMaximized Use of Existing Property and Assets\nMake Built-Heritage Resources Key Features: Many garden \nattractions are also able to leverage their history by preserving and \nrepurposing the significant architectural elements of their properties \n(such as walled gardens, Victorian glasshouses or historic homes) \nas they lend an important atmosphere, sense of place and quality \nto the visitor experience. Opportunity exists for DBG to enhance \nand promote their existing show houses to make them a more \nprominent part of year-round offering. The Butterfly House should \nbe the priority and should provide dedicated programming. As \nthese structures are currently dated, future replacement should be \nconsidered in the long-term. \nThe Arthur Erickson designed Dyde House presents significant \nopportunity for housing new programs while celebrating the legacy \nof one of Canada’s greatest architects. Hosting conferences, \nretreats, and temporary or permanent exhibits are a few applicable \nprograms. \nAccess to the Gardens After Dark: The Luminaria event at DBG \nmakes excellent use of light in the garden already, but opportunity \nexists to extend this further with additional programming. With late \nopening hours on most Thursdays during the summer months, \nDBG could help to increase interest in the gardens through creative \nilluminations. Sleepovers (for adults as well as children) are also \nbecoming increasingly popular and could be considered. \nImproved Visitor Facilities and Amenities\nEcological Learning Centre: The ELC is an important addition to \nthe DBG, as it will help to alleviate a number of operational and \ncapacity issues and provides new opportunities for improving the \nvisitor experience and extending learning, events and activities.  \nThe addition of the ELC will extend the season by providing indoor \nspace for visitors to take part in learning, events and activities during \ncolder or inclement weather, providing a venue for hosting new \nprograms such as temporary indoor exhibitions, and providing a \nmuch needed upgrade to visitor support facilities. It will become a \ncentral focus of the Garden experience and circulation experience. \nMake the Mundane an Outstanding Experience: Improvement of \nvisitor facilities and amenities is a priority for the future success of \nDBG. While toilets, benches and gateways seem mundane, careful \nconsideration of their design can transform these experiences from \nhumdrum into extraordinary, setting an attraction apart from others. \nSmart positioning and the functionality of these new features is \nessential and should not be overlooked. \nWidened and More Diverse Offerings\nLeverage History and Legacy: The history and development of the \nDevonian Botanic Gardens and the legacy of Sandy and Bobby \nDyde and their family, particularly associations with the Edmonton \nSymphony Orchestra, the Stratford Festival and the National Gallery \nof Canada, provide an important resource which DBG should look to \nexploit to its fullest. \nTemporary Exhibitions: Exhibitions are an important tool for gardens \nto communicate knowledge and new ideas to the public and \nshare collections, research and expertise. They are essential for \nattracting repeat visitors from the surrounding local market as they \nprovide regular changing content. The ELC provides an important \nopportunity for DBG to curate their own indoor exhibitions around \na multitude of topics and themes, as well as to act as a receiving \nvenue for touring exhibitions from other gardens or cultural \ninstitutions. Additional opportunity exists for using the gardens as \na venue to host outdoor exhibits such as art installations. A well \nplanned exhibition program which links with DBG’s interpretive \nstrategy should be established to maximize efforts and investment \nso that temporary exhibitions appeal to the widest possible \naudience. \nCreate a Sense of Occasion: The DBG Luminaria event is a \ncornerstone draw in winter, but opportunity exists to create new \nand distinctive occasions at other times of the year by infusing \nevents with glamour and capitalizing on unique plants in the current \ncollection and/or garden features such as DBG’s many lakes and \nponds. \nGardens as a Backdrop for Performance and Art: Gardens provide \na unique and contrasting setting for hosting events and activities. \nThe natural environment is multisensory and lends itself particularly \nwell for live performance such as dance and music, as well as for \ncontemporary art. Works, often developed by famous artists, use \nthe local environment and history as inspiration and are unique for \ntheir site specific location. While DBG has a few existing pieces of \nart in the gardens, these are not by notable artists and are not of the \nscale that would create enough interest to attract contemporary art \naudiences. Opportunity exists to develop a collection of art pieces \nunique to DBG to create new interest in the garden. \nMajor New Attractions\nBiodomes: Biodomes and glasshouses are major attractors for \nmany visitors and gardens. With the aging infrastructure of DBG’s \nshow houses, opportunity exists to begin considering how these \nexperiences may be reinvigorated and perhaps even replaced. DBG \ncould consider the design and installation of a series of biodomes as \na key attraction for development on-site in the long-term.\nLong-Terms Stays at the Garden: The Peace Gardens have invested \nin on-site accommodation in order to encourage guests to spend \nmore time enjoying the gardens and to provide a new experience. \nOpportunity exists at DBG to extend the visitor stay at the gardens \nby providing on-site accommodation such as a lodge hotel, \nindividual cottages, and/or camping/glamping. The experience could \nbe further intensified by including great food and dining options. \nLand Art: Land Art is an artistic movement in which landscape and \nthe work of art are inextricably linked. It is created in nature, using \nnatural materials such as soil, rock, plants, and water, with other \nmaterials such as concrete or metal. Sculptures are not placed in \nthe landscape, rather, the landscape is the means of their creation. \nOpportunity exists at DBG to create an outstanding piece of land art \nat the gardens and become one of the first places in Canada to offer \nsuch an experience. \nDR\nAF\nT\nLegend\nLegend\nLegend\nLegend\nLegend\nLegend\n1\n3\n4\n5\n6\n2\n Photos Caption\n| \nu\nn\niv\ne\nr\ns\nit\ny\n o\nf\n a\nl\nb\ne\nr\nta\n  D\nev\non\nia\nn \nBo\nta\nni\nc \nG\nar\nde\nn \nM\nas\nte\nr P\nla\nn\n50\nThe establishment of a new main entrance for the Garden south of \nthe existing green houses will welcome visitors with a gateways, \ngardens, facilities and parking. The proximity of the new entry to \nthe existing established gardens will require this area to become \na destination as well as the starting point of the visitors journey. \nThe gateway will incorporate vertical elements that are visible from \na distance along Highway 40 to signal the entry point. Through \ngate, two major parking lots will provide close proximity parking \nto the main garden promenade  leading to the new exhibition and \nproduction greenhouses and biomes. These facilities will increase \nthe Garden’s capacity for production and indoor exhibition space for \nnon-native and adaptive plants. They will allow a window into the \nprocesses undertaken to manage the Garden providing visitors with \nlearning and educational experiences. Additional programs for this \narea include small commercial opportunities such as a cafe or gift \nshop. \nSetting forward from this area, visitors have choices on how their \nexperience can unfold. Pathways lead south to the trails of the \nNature Exploration District, northeast toward the Dyde House \nDistrict or northwest toward the Ecological Learning Centre and the \nGarden Collections District.

The garden \nshould provide an overture of the exhibits and themes found \nthroughout the collections. \n o Develop new greenhouses and biomes for exhibitions and \nproduction. This will establish the first major attraction upon \nentrance to the Garden. \n o Integrate clear wayfinding and signage to direct visitors on \ntheir journey. \n o Establish a maintenance yard that is screened from the \ngreenhouses and Japanese Garden. Limit the storage of \nheavy and noisy machinery in this area. \n o Develop a new formal driveway that connects the gateway \nto the parking at the Ecological Learning Centre. The road \nshould be narrow and accommodate pedestrian movement \nsafely where required. The experience of the road must be \ncarefully considered including views to adjacent gardens and \nfacilities. \n o Infrastructure formalizing the trailhead of the Prospector trail \nshould be integrated into the gateway.\nDR\nAF\nT\n| \nu\nn\niv\ne\nr\ns\nit\ny\n o\nf\n a\nl\nb\ne\nr\nta\n  D\nev\non\nia\nn \nBo\nta\nni\nc \nG\nar\nde\nn \nM\nas\nte\nr P\nla\nn\n52\n Photos Caption\nDR\nAF\nT\n| \nu\nn\niv\ne\nr\ns\nit\ny\n o\nf\n a\nl\nb\ne\nr\nta\n  D\nev\non\nia\nn \nBo\nta\nni\nc \nG\nar\nde\nn \nM\nas\nte\nr P\nla\nn\n53\nDR\nAF\nT\nLegend\nLegend\nLegend\nLegend\nLegend\nLegend\n1\n3\n4\n5\n6\n2\n Map Caption\n Photos Caption\n| \nu\nn\niv\ne\nr\ns\nit\ny\n o\nf\n a\nl\nb\ne\nr\nta\n  D\nev\non\nia\nn \nBo\nta\nni\nc \nG\nar\nde\nn \nM\nas\nte\nr P\nla\nn\n54\nThe Imrie Wetland is one of the significant natural areas located \nwithin close proximity to the centre of the Garden.

Within the Devonian Botanic Garden, the plan \nestablishes a hierarchy of primary and secondary gateways. The \nprimary gateway is the entry to the Garden from Highway 40. \nSecondary gateways are located throughout the property at key \nthresholds from parking gardens and the Ecological Learning Centre. \nPrimary Gateway\nThe primary gateway for the Garden will shift to the intersection \nsouth of existing greenhouses. This will allow for safe vehicle access \nfrom both the north and south as well as become the terminus \nfor the proposed Prospector Trail. From the moment a vehicle \npasses from Highway 40, the experience of the Garden must begin. \nTicketing can occur at this point and visitors will commence their \njourney with a choice of circulation routes. This gateway must \nalso become a landmark, signalling the Garden from considerable \ndistance along Highway 40. \nSecondary Gateways\nSecondary gateways connect to primary pathways and celebrate the \nentry at key destination points. \nEcological Learning Centre\nBus, shuttle, and mobility-challenged visitor drop off and parking will \noccur at the Ecological Learning Centre. This parking lot can also be \nutilized for all visitors during off-peak seasons. As such, the arrival \nsequence from the primary gateway to the parking garden and \nbuilding must be an experience unto itself. A plaza will greet visitors \nand provide orientation to the ELC and the gardens beyond. \nNorth Garden Gateway\nEvent parking and mobility-challenged visitor drop-off and parking \ncan occur at the north end of the Garden Collection District. \nConnecting a primary pathway, the gateway should welcome visitors \nentering from this area through a transition space prior to entering \ninto a specific garden.\nSoutheast Garden Gateway\nThis gateway provides access to the Forest Pathway, a natural \narea walk past the overnight accommodation site and on to the \nDyde house. It could function as a stand alone gateway for visitors \naccessing the Garden from the east parking lot or visitors making a \nloop through the Nature Exploration District. \nNature Discovery District Gateways\nMinor gateways exist in the Nature Discovery District that will orient \nvisitors as the enter the area from the parking gardens. \nEdges\nThe edges surrounding the Garden and the edges within the garden \nare critical components in the experience of the place.

They are \ndestinations and major attractions as well as viewpoints and small \nmoments of rest. The plan proposes a choreographed series of \nnodes and landmarks to create a memorable visitor experience. \nMajor and minor moments are balanced with the flow of movement \nfrom one space to the next to build a rhythm to the experience from \nthe moment of arrival to the moment of departure. \nNodes \nNode development is a critical aspect of creating a comfortable \nand legible visitor experiences. Nodes are destinations within the \ngarden that provide reason to pause, whether that is a major exhibit \nfeature, pathway junction, viewpoint, shelter, or simply a strategically \nlocated cluster of seating. Nodes are attractors within the garden \nwith visitors planning their route according to the nodes they wish to \nexperience. \nExisting nodes will be consolidated and enhanced as part of \nrefinements to the circulation network. This will enhance the \ngarden’s legibility and way-finding. \nDevelopment guidelines for nodes include: \n o Focus minor node development at the intersection of primary \npathways. \n o Minor nodes should contain site elements such as: seating, \nwaste receptacles, way-finding signage, interpretive \nelements, and sculpture. \n o Major nodes may contain elements listed for minor nodes as \nwell as larger amenities such as: shelter, viewpoint/lookout, \nrestroom, or play area.\n o Nodes should be distributed to balance the experience of \nmovement and rest. \nLandmarks\nLandmarks are key garden features such as major facilities and \nnatural features. They are similar to nodes and may even be part of \na node, but their significance is greater with respect to the overall \norganization of the garden. Landmarks are ultimate destinations and \nvisit defining moments. With the expansion of programmed territory, \ncomes the need to add significant landmarks to entice visitors \nand provide new and diverse program offerings. The plan aims to \nreinforce certain existing landmarks and create new landmarks in the \nexpanded areas. \nThe Ecological Learning Centre, Grebe Pond Cafe, Dyde House, \nIslamic Garden, and Biodome will become the central landmarks \nof the garden. These landmarks build a logical loop for visitor \ncirculation around the garden that encompasses major visitor \nattractions including the Japanese Garden, Dyde Lawn, Imrie \nWetland, Winter Garden, Garden Collections, and Dune Garden. \nThe Islamic Garden becomes the central landmark of the garden \ncollections, a point that can be returned to from adjacent areas. \nMinor landmarks include the tower, Imrie Wetland, Lodge, Bog \nlookout, and the various lookouts in the Nature Discovery District \nand Nature Exploration District. \nDevelopment guidelines for landmarks include: \n o Landmarks must be distinctive and memorable. \n o Utilize the power of significant landmarks to enhance the \noverall identity of the garden by incorporating consistent \nmaterials, themes, and elements. \n o Through the design and configuration of pathways, \nemphasize the approach to landmarks through sightlines. \nEnsure landmarks are visible from some distance. \n o The design of new landmarks should consider the image it \ncan portray in marketing and promotional materials. \n 4.4 Nodes & Landmarks\nDR\nAF\nT\n| \nu\nn\niv\ne\nr\ns\nit\ny\n o\nf\n a\nl\nb\ne\nr\nta\n  D\nev\non\nia\nn \nBo\nta\nni\nc \nG\nar\nde\nn \nM\nas\nte\nr P\nla\nn\n73\nPINE \nPAVILION\nCAFE\nDYDE\nHOUSE\nBIODOMEECOLOGICAL \nLEARNING \nCENTRE\nExisting Landmark\nProposed Landmark\nExisting Major Note\nProposed Major Note\n Map Caption\n Map Caption\nDR\nAF\nT\n| \nu\nn\niv\ne\nr\ns\nit\ny\n o\nf\n a\nl\nb\ne\nr\nta\n  D\nev\non\nia\nn \nBo\nta\nni\nc \nG\nar\nde\nn \nM\nas\nte\nr P\nla\nn\n74\nCirculation and parking are critical to the future growth of the \ngarden. The current garden is limited by arrival access issues, \nparking capacity and a challenging wayfinding.

It will create \nsafer turning movements from Highway 40 and opens up land for \nmuch needed parking. Here, two parking gardens will provide a main \npoint of departure for visitors. Additional parking will be developed \nat the east end of this access road for added capacity during \nevents. The current main parking area can remain functional. During \npeak season it may be required for buses, shuttles, and mobility-\nchallenged visitors. During off-peak seasons, this lot can become \nthe primary visitor lot again. \nDevelopment guidelines for parking include: \n o Increase parking capacity through the movement of the main \nentrance and building of new parking gardens. \n o Add overflow and event parking at the east end of the new \naccess road and at the north end of the Garden Collections \nDistrict. \n o Local parking lots should be developed for access to the \nNature Exploration District and Nature Discovery District. \n o Parking areas should be screened from garden views as \nmuch as possible while remaining sufficiently visible from the \nentry for visitor orientation and safety. \n o Parking areas should be designed as gardens with vegetative \nbuffers between parking rows. \n o Utilize low-impact development measures such as bioswales \nand permeable pavements to manage stormwater. \n o Provide clear signage and way-finding. \n o Incorporate space for shuttle services. \nCirculation \nPedestrian circulation must be intuitive and offer clear route choices \nfor visitors. The structure of pathways is important for ease of way-\nfinding and for providing multiple ways of experiencing the garden. \nA clear hierarchy of pathway types is proposed that considers \npedestrian volume, shuttle and maintenance access requirements, \ntopography, vegetation, materials, and experience. The network \nconsists of the following types: \nPrimary\nThe main circulation routes through the garden are the primary \npathways. These are asphalt paths with a header on each side that \nare 4m wide. Maintenance vehicles and shuttles can utilize these \npaths to access all of the main attractions. \nSecondary\nBranching from the primary pathways, secondary paths are either \npaved or granular paths providing the main route through a garden \nor exhibit. These pathways are 2m wide and should always link back \nto a primary pathway. \nTertiary\nTertiary pathways can branch from either secondary paths or the \nprimary path. These paths enter tighter spaces such as forest \ngardens or intimate garden spaces. They are 1.5m wide and typically \ngranular, but can also be asphalt. \nNature Trails \nThrough natural areas, a small trail system may be all that is required \nor possible given the terrain. These trails my be constructed with \ngranular or bark mulch or may remain simply as a dirt path. These \ntrails should be documented and shown on all wayfinding maps. \nBoardwalks\nThrough wetlands, marshes, bogs, and fens, boardwalks may be the \nmost appropriate pathway type. They should be a minium of 1.5m \nwide with railings or kick rails as required. \n 4.5 Circulation & Parking\nDevelopment guidelines for circulation include: \n o Implement a hierarchical pathway system that provides \nintuitive way-finding and multiple visitor experiences. \n o Provide signage and way-finding clues at intersections and \nthrough the use of materials. \n o Maps should be coded for different visitor experiences such \nas nature walks, garden walks, major attractions, play areas, \nand food. \n o Utilize the most appropriate pathway type for the expected \nlevel of usage and terrain. \nDR\nAF\nT\n| \nu\nn\niv\ne\nr\ns\nit\ny\n o\nf\n a\nl\nb\ne\nr\nta\n  D\nev\non\nia\nn \nBo\nta\nni\nc \nG\nar\nde\nn \nM\nas\nte\nr P\nla\nn\n75\nP\nR\nO\nSP\nEC\nTO\nR\n T\nR\nA\nIL\nC\nO\nN\nN\nEC\nTI\nO\nN\nP\nR\nO\nP\nO\nSE\nD\n P\nR\nO\nSP\nEC\nTO\nR\n T\nR\nA\nIL\nPROPOSED PROSPECTOR TRAIL\nDUNE \nWALK\nEXISTING ROAD\n(UNCONTROLLED ACCESS)\nBOG \nLODGE + \nRESTAURANT\nPARKING \nGARDEN\nOVERFLOW \nPARKING \nGARDEN\nPARKING \nGARDEN\nPARKING \nGARDEN\nPARKING \nGARDEN\nTHE BOG\nW/ BOARDWALK\nEVENT \nPARKING \nGARDEN \nGATEWAY\nGARDEN \nGATEWAY\nGATED PUBLIC \nENTRY\nC A\nN\nO\nP\nY\n W\nA\nL\nK\n194 m\n74 m\n153 m\n158 m\n106 m\n77 m27 m\n89\n m\n140 m\n211 m\n42 m\n82 m\n60 m\n189\n m\n90\n m\n74 m\n56 m\n60 m1\n23\n m\n160 m\n32 m\n366 m\n27\n m\n198 m\n145 m29\n0 m\n108\n m\n177 m\n120 m\n211 m\n345 m\n272 m 44 m\n906 m\n808 m\n418 m\n253 m\n239 m\n521 m\n194 m\n243 m\n20\n4 m\nPrimary Circulation\nRoadway\nProspector road\nSecondary Circulation\nTrail\nGateway \nLandmark\nMajor Note\nMinor Note\n Map Caption\nDR\nAF\nT\n| \nu\nn\niv\ne\nr\ns\nit\ny\n o\nf\n a\nl\nb\ne\nr\nta\n  D\nev\non\nia\nn \nBo\nta\nni\nc \nG\nar\nde\nn \nM\nas\nte\nr P\nla\nn\n76\n1.2 - 1.5 m Tertiary Circulation Pathway 2.0 m Boardwalk 1.2 -2.0 m Nature Trail (Granular or Dirt)\nPATHWAYS + CIRCULATION\nCROSS-SECTIONS\n1.5 m 2.0 m (min) 1.2 m (min)\nPATHWAYS + CIRCULATION\nCROSS-SECTIONS\n3.0 m Primary Circulation Pathway (Asphalt) With Edger 1.5 - 2.0 m Secondary Circulation Pathway (Asphalt or Granular)\n2.0 m3.0 m\nPrimary Pedestrian Pathway - Circulation\nAsphalt with edger\nSecondary Pedestrian Pathway - Circulation \nAsphalt or granular\nBoardwalk \nNature Trails\nGranular or dirtTertiary Pathway - Circulation\nAsphalt or granular\nDR\nAF\nT\n| \nu\nn\niv\ne\nr\ns\nit\ny\n o\nf\n a\nl\nb\ne\nr\nta\n  D\nev\non\nia\nn \nBo\nta\nni\nc \nG\nar\nde\nn \nM\nas\nte\nr P\nla\nn\n77\nSCREENED \nMAINTENANCE YARD\nSCREENED \nMAINTENANCE YARD\nMAIN MAINTENANCE YARD \n+ GARDEN STORAGE/\nLAYDOWN AREA\nKURIMOTO JAPANESE \nGARDENS ENTRANCE \nLOADING BAY\nISLAMIC GARDEN\nLOADING BAY\nKURIMOTO JAPANESE \nGARDENS / OZAWA \nPAVILION\nLOADING BAY\nECOLOGICAL \nLEARNING CENTRE\nLOADING BAY\nDYDE HOUSE LOADING BAY\nBOG LODGE\nLOADING BAY\nWASTEWATER \nTREATMENT PLANT\nLOADING BAY\nRESEARCH CENTRE\nService Vehicle Routes,  \nLoading & Maintenance Yards\nService, loading, and maintenance are critical components of the \nGarden.

A \nbalance between efficiency and discretion must be struck to ensure \nvisitor’s experiences are not negatively impacted by back of house \noperations. \nThe Sector Plan establishes a new main service yard at the \nnortheast corner of the Nature Exploration District. This yard will be \nthe primary base of operations for maintenance activities, storing \nmajor equipment and supplies. Throughout the northern districts, \nlocal service yards provide a base for operations at key locations. \nLoading zones are located discretely where required and where \npossible share space with maintenance yards. \nService and vehicle routes through the Garden follows the primary \npathway system, which is constructed to manage occasional heavy \nvehicle loading. A new vehicle route is required for construction \naccess and service access to the Islamic Garden. This route will \nfollow the path of least resistance through the forest and double as a \nprimary pathway upon completion. \nThe development of service routes, loading and \nmaintenance yards should consider the following design \nguidelines: \n o Locate maintenance yards and loading docks where they can \nbe fully screened from areas accessible by visitors. \n o Establish a primary maintenance yard along with several local \nyards throughout the garden. \n o Design vehicle service routes to blend into the pathway \nnetwork and double as pedestrian routes. \n o Design new vehicle routes to follow the lay of the land in \norder to minimize environmental disturbance. \n o Design the primary pedestrian paths to handle occasional \nheavy vehicle loading. \nexisting service vehicle \nconditions  photo\nprecedents with asphalt \nand pavers\n Map Caption\nDR\nAF\nT\n Map Caption\n| \nu\nn\niv\ne\nr\ns\nit\ny\n o\nf\n a\nl\nb\ne\nr\nta\n  D\nev\non\nia\nn \nBo\nta\nni\nc \nG\nar\nde\nn \nM\nas\nte\nr P\nla\nn\n78\nWINTER \nACTIVITIES IN \nDYDE LAWN \n(SNOW MAZE)\nBOG LODGE \nREMAINS OPEN \nDURING WNNTER \nMONTHS\nTERTIARY NATURE \nTRAILS THROUGH \nWINTER GARDEN AND \nWINTER FOREST\nISLAMIC \nGARDEN WINTER \nPROGRAMMING\nKURIMOTO JAPANESE \nGARDEN WINTER \nPROGRAMMING\nECOLOGICAL \nLEARNING CENTRE \nBIODOMES + \nGREENHOUSES \nOFFER SHELTERED \nPROGRAMMING + \nACTIVITIES DURING \nWINTER MONTHS\nP\nR\nO\nP\nO\nSE\nD\n P\nR\nO\nSP\nEC\nTO\nR\n T\nR\nA\nIL\nPROPOSED PROSPECTOR TRAIL\nExpanding program opportunities into current off seasons and the \nwinter should be a focus of the Garden as it expands. The plan sets \nforward a logical operating structure for winter months by reducing \nthe area that is open and focusing exhibits and programmable \nspaces in a consolidated and logical circulation route. This is \nstrategy is aimed at reducing the winter operations requirements for \nsnow clearing, maintenance, and monitoring, while offering unique \nexhibits and flexible spaces for multiple programs. \nCommencing from either the Ecological Learning Centre or the main \ngateway, a concise circulation loop extends around and through \nthe Islamic Garden, through the Winter Garden to the Dyde House \nand Lawn, and back to the Biodome and Greenhouses. At the \nBiodome and Greenhouses, visitors can experience indoor gardens \nand propagation. The Ecological Learning Centre offers classes \non winter gardening, indoor plants, and seed propagation. The \nIslamic Garden’s structured gardens rest softly in the snow and the \nWinter Garden shows that plants have life beyond the fall. The Dyde \nLawn is a programmable space featuring at times a snow maze, \nsnow sculptures, and sleigh rides. The Lodge continues to offer \naccommodation and event space and the southern trails are open \nfor snowshoeing and cross-country skiing. \nDevelopment guidelines for winter operations include: \n o Provide an easily accessible and maintainable pathway that \nconnects major elements and is open to visitors year round. \nUtilize durable materials that can withstand brushing/plowing. \n o Create a Winter Garden that focuses on plants that have \ninterest throughout the year with a particular interest during \nthe winter. Plants include Achillea, Astilbe, Echinacea, \nRudbeckia, Sedum cultivars, Calamagrostis brachytricha, \nand Deschampsia cespitosa. \n o Develop a winter event schedule that builds on the success \nof Luminaria. Events such as a Winter Garden Festival can \nbuild on Edmonton’s Winter City Strategy. \n o Offer winter specific courses and programs. \n o Utilize permanent or temporary light in gardens to prolong the \nday and add interest. \n o Offer trails for informal snowshoeing and cross-country \nskiing. \n 4.6 Winter Operations\nDR\nAF\nT\n| \nu\nn\niv\ne\nr\ns\nit\ny\n o\nf\n a\nl\nb\ne\nr\nta\n  D\nev\non\nia\nn \nBo\nta\nni\nc \nG\nar\nde\nn \nM\nas\nte\nr P\nla\nn\n79\nDR\nAF\nT\nDR\nAF\nT\n 5.0 Plan Implementation\nDR\nAF\nT\nNew intro text here\n 5.1 Future Planned Development\nDR\nAF\nT\n| \n83\n5.2.1 Islamic Garden\nThe Islamic Garden is major new development to be integrated into \nthe existing garden. Adjacent to Calla Pond, the Islamic Garden will \nadd new pavilions to the garden and host many events. \n5.2.2 Ecological Learning Centre\nThe Ecological Learning Centre (ELC) will become the major facility \nfor the garden, housing offices, showrooms, classroom and a main \ngallery space. \n5.2.3 Edmonton Regional Ringroad  \n + Highway 60 Expansion\nNew lanes will eventually be added to Highway 60 as part of the \nregional ring road for Edmonton. Noise buffering methods as well as \nprogramming will need to take this expansion into consideration. \n5.2.4 Relocation of Garden Entrance\nThe new garden entrance will be moved south and a new traffic light \nmay potentially be added to the intersection. The Gateway Garden \nDistrict has been planned considering the relocation of the main \nvehicular entrance. \n5.2.5 Prospector Trail\nThe Prospector Trail alignment will create a major pedestrian route \nfrom Edmonton to the garden and everywhere in between.   \n5.2.6 Irrigation Requirements\nFuture facilities such as the Islamic Garden pavilions and the ELC, \nwill require potable water and will create grey and black water. The \nDBG will need to incorporate these demands into the planning of \nwater treatment facilities. Additionally, existing and new gardens will \nneed to be irrigated to ensure plants are healthy for the spring and \nsummer months.  \n 5.2 Short Term\nDR\nAF\nT\n| \nu\nn\niv\ne\nr\ns\nit\ny\n o\nf\n a\nl\nb\ne\nr\nta\n  D\nev\non\nia\nn \nBo\nta\nni\nc \nG\nar\nde\nn \nM\nas\nte\nr P\nla\nn\n84\nNew text here\n 5.3 Medium Term\nDR\nAF\nT\n| \nu\nn\niv\ne\nr\ns\nit\ny\n o\nf\n a\nl\nb\ne\nr\nta\n  D\nev\non\nia\nn \nBo\nta\nni\nc \nG\nar\nde\nn \nM\nas\nte\nr P\nla\nn\n85\nNew text here\n 5.4 Long Term\nDR\nAF\nT\nDR\nAF\nT\n Appendix A\nDR\nAF\nT\n| \nu\nn\niv\ne\nr\ns\nit\ny\n o\nf\n a\nl\nb\ne\nr\nta\n  D\nev\non\nia\nn \nBo\nta\nni\nc \nG\nar\nde\nn \nM\nas\nte\nr P\nla\nn\n88\nEvaluation Summary: \nMarch 31st and June 1st, 2015 \n1.

Do you see benefits to quality of environment, property \nvalues, and long-term protection of green space resulting \nfrom a sensitively and carefully planned garden such as the \nDevonian Botanic Garden? Please explain.\n o Yes it’s a great place for a day out with the family. Areas \nlike this are very calming in light of all the construction and \nexpansion from Edmonton/Parkland County.\n o Yes\n o The Gardens is a great resource for teaching, learning and \nexploring the local flora. The conservation of green spaces, \nespecially those that display local species, is particularly \nimportant as Edmonton encroaches on this area.\n o We support DBG and all its efforts. It’s great to have a \nfantastic facility in our own backyard. The benefit of green \nspace protection is ideal for this area. The health of trees and \nfoliage is lacking these days. With the city expanding over the \nnext years it’s ideal to be living so close to the gardens for \nprotection and sustainability.\n o Biggest benefit will be showing the youth what nature is. A \ngrandmas garden like at the Ukrainian Village might be nice.\n10. Please provide any further comments about the \npreliminary Devonian Botanic Garden Sector Plan\n o If the trail system is approved I don’t believe it would be wise \nor in the best interest of mothers with children to be walking \nin secluded areas away from regular public view for the sake \nof safety and self assurance self-assurance. Being close to \nHwy 60 would still instill confidence and peace of mind.\n o Looks comprehensive. Tie into prospector trail is important \nas is better/safer highway access.\n o Our neighbours in Banksiana are concerned with the \nalignment of the prospector’s trail IN THE SUBDIVISION \nAND TO THE EAST OF THE LANDOWNERS. The County of \nParkland, in our opinion, has done a terrible job in evaluating \nand communicating to the residents in Banksiana. We \nunderstand the Hwy 60 option (following along the east side) \nwas available. Residents in Banksiana are opposed to the \ntrail travelling through the subdivision unanimously.\n o More information needed as to why expansion is required, \nrather than wanted. Banksiana Road was not labelled on  \nyour proposal picture boards/patterns. Land owners next to \nyour land was and business should have been brought into a \nmeeting prior to your trail proposals. We may not like a future \ntraffic light, increased car/bus traffic etc. You have completely \nshut out of your local land/home owners and not allowed any \ninput into your growth. Many of us are NOT happy with that.\n o I guess the trees are not tall enough fro a zip line??? A \nhumming bird gallery might be nice from early May to late \nAugust.\n11. Please comment on your impressions regarding the \nsector plan for the Devonian Botanic Garden \n o District 1 – Garden Gateway:  \nImpressive - do you charge entrance here or at a spot you \nwalk to. People taking courses should have a bypass.\n o District 2 – Garden Collections: \nI like the different paths and also the canopy walk\n o District 3 – Imrie Wetland: \nWith viewing platforms it will give you a better perspective \nand perhaps we could have telescopes so we can focus in on \nthe waterfowl which I’m sure we have.\n o District 4 – Dyde House: \nStay overnight is a good idea in a treehouse\n o District 5 – Nature Exploration: \nOur grandchildren really enjoyed the pond study.

It is an exceptional place with stunning display gardens, including the \nKurimoto Japanese Garden, the Patrick Seymour Alpine Garden, Canada’s first Native People’s \nGarden, and a Heritage Garden. The garden was named Botanic Garden of the Year in 2014 as part of \nthe Canadian Garden Council’s Garden Tourism Awards. Approximately 70,000 visitors a year of all \nages are delighted by spectacular lilac, lily and peony beds, a one-acre herb garden, a nearby sensory \nand healing garden, and one of western Canada’s largest rose gardens. \nThe garden is home to greenhouses, a butterfly house, 11,000 named plants, an extensive nature trail \nsystem with 180 acres of natural areas and ecological preserves. Primarily a research site, the garden \nis open May through Thanksgiving to visitors from around the world, school groups, various \ncelebrations, or students on course. \nFor the past 50 years the Devonian Botanic Garden has delighted and connected people with the \nbeauty of nature, the rich cultural heritage, experiential learning, and a living laboratory for important \nenvironmental, ecological and horticultural research as well as symposia, scientific meetings, class field \ntrips, art exhibitions, and faculty and administration assemblies. \nIssues \nAs the garden develops into a top-tier botanic garden, so have the challenges. The facilities are \nstretched to meet the demands for the services provided. As examples of the facilities’ inadequacy: \noffice space and research areas are housed in trailers; visitor facilities have insufficient space for \ninterpretive displays; and the gift shop, washrooms and other guest service areas are no longer able to \nmeet demand. In order to welcome more visitors and to accommodate oversubscribed education \nprograms together with appropriate research workspace, there are plans to construct several \ninfrastructure related projects, including: road works, parking expansions, waste water treatment, \nlighting and the proposed new Islamic Garden that will supplement current garden inventory.  \nA capital improvement grant was provided by the Government of Alberta (GOA) to the University of \nAlberta (UA) to provide and enhance services with the design and basic infrastructure upgrades to \nsupport the current and planned growth and will generally be inclusive of the following: water and \nutilities, which included water supply, waste treatment, rainwater harvesting, irrigation and electrical and \ngas services upgrades; landscaping and upgrades for site access infrastructure; sound attenuation; \nwetland reclamation; and related parking and road works. (A portion of the GOA grant will also be used \nfor the Islamic Garden - providing capital support for base infrastructure service requirements, \nincluding: road, power, gas, water and sewer.)  \nThe university became a beneficiary of a generous gift from His Highness the Aga Khan, which was \nannounced in June 2009 at the University of Alberta Graduation ceremony. His Highness the Aga Khan \nidentified that the gift be used to create a traditional Islamic Garden within the DBG. The gift is for \ndesign and construction related elements for the Devonian Islamic Garden.  \nAttachment 1 \nBen Louie, University Architect                                   Page 2 of 2                                                June 23, 2016 \nThe garden, a nine acre development, will include design elements such as extensive fountains, \nwetland design, massing of architectural components, massing of planting and screening strategies, \nthresholds and entrances to the garden, and connectivity to adjacent collections.  \nThe Islamic Garden’s guiding design principles include: \n• To interpret the Islamic Garden tradition in a modern form and expression; \n• To be inspired by the rich history of Islamic landscape design (in form, experience, and symbolism) \nwhile responding to the unique qualities of the local Albertan ecology and geography; \n• To create intentional design that is supportive of the ecologies of the Calla Pond and surrounding \nwoodland in the tradition of Islamic environmental ethics; and \n• To create transformative garden experiences for visitors inspired by sensorial qualities of the Islamic \nGarden. \nThe Islamic Garden’s design is conceptually organized by three primary experiences: the Woodland \nWalk, the Central Court, and the Bustan - an Arabic and Persian term referring to an agricultural garden \nor a farm near the house which includes fruit trees, vegetable seedlings, shrubs, and spices. The word \nin Persian also means a place of smell in English. It will be reinforced through the careful design of \nwater elements, the use of beautiful materials through both traditional and contemporary construction \nmethods, and the appropriate selection and deployment of plants. The garden will become another \nsignificant feature and outstanding attraction to the DBG, which is positioned to lead in studies of \ncultural interpretation and history. \nIn presenting a coherent and comprehensive plan for the DBG, the proposed Islamic Garden is \nintegrated into the sector planning work which is being developed concurrently. It is situated in the \nGarden Collections District where the various planning organizing elements of gateway, edges, \npathways, nodes and landmarks are interwoven to create a holistic landscape that supports the vision \nand the eight guiding principles of the DBG.  \nThe result is a stunning design that will become a showpiece and valued addition to Edmonton’s \ncultural and natural landscape. \n\tFinal\n\tItem-4-Lister-5-Design-Development\n\tItem-4-Lister-5-Design-Development-OI\n\tItem-4-Lister-5-Design-Development-ATT1\n\tItem-4-Lister-5-Design-Development-ATT2\n\tItem-5-ECV-Design-Development\n\tItem-5-ECV-Design-Development-OI\n\tItem-5-ECV-Design-Development-ATT1\n\tATT 5 Appendix D 35 Percent Working Drawing Submission.pdf\n\tSheets and Views\n\tA000 COVERSHEET\n\tA001 GENERAL NOTES\n\tA101 SITE PLAN\n\tA201 LOWER LEVEL CONSTRUCTION PLAN\n\tA202 FIRST LEVEL CONSTRUCTION PLAN\n\tA203 SECOND FLOOR CONSTRUCTION PLAN\n\tA204 THIRD FLOOR CONSTRUCTION PLAN\n\tA205 FOURTH LEVEL CONSTRUCTION PLAN\n\tA206 FIFTH LEVEL CONSTRUCTION PLAN\n\tA207 ROOF PLAN\n\tA208 LOWER LEVEL REFLECTED CEILING PLAN\n\tA209 FIRST LEVEL REFLECTED CEILING PLAN\n\tA210 SECOND LEVEL REFLECTED CEILING PLAN\n\tA211 THIRD LEVEL REFLECTED CEILING PLAN\n\tA212 FOURTH LEVEL REFLECTED CEILING PLAN\n\tA213 FIFTH LEVEL REFLECTED CEILING PLAN\n\tA214 LOWER LEVEL FINISHES PLAN\n\tA215 FIRST LEVEL FINISHES PLAN\n\tA216 SECOND LEVEL FINISHES PLAN\n\tA217 THIRD FLOOR FINISHES PLAN\n\tA218 FOURTH FLOOR FINISHES PLAN\n\tA219 FIFTH LEVEL FINISHES PLAN\n\tA300 EXTERIOR ELEVATIONS\n\tA301 EXTERIOR ELEVATIONS\n\tA302 EXTERIOR ELEVATION\n\tA303 BUILDING SECTIONS\n\tA304 BUILDING SECTIONS\n\tA401 WALL SECTIONS\n\tA402 WALL SECTIONS\n\tA403 WALL SECTIONS\n\tA404 WALL SECTIONS\n\tA405 WALL SECTIONS\n\tA601 STAIR PLANS, SECTIONS, AND DETAILS\n\tA602 STAIR PLANS, SECTIONS AND DETAILS\n\tA603 STAIR PLANS, SECTION, AND DETAILS\n\tA701 ENLARGED SUITE PLANS\n\tA702 ENLARGED SUITE PLANS\n\tItem-5-ECV-Design-Development-ATT2\n\tItem-8-DBG-Sector-Planning\n\tItem-8-DBG-Sector-Planning-OI\n\tItem-8-DBG-Sector-Planning-ATT1\n\tItem-8-DBG-Sector-Planning-ATT2\n\tItem-9-Islamic-Garden-Design\n\tItem-9-Islamic-Garden-Design-OI\n\tItem-9-Islamic-Garden-Design-ATT1\n",
