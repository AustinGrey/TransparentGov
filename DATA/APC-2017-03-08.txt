Discussion: Dr Goebel highlighted key items from the Report, including the current number of centres and institutes, the imminent closure of 13 on the recommendation of the associated Dean, and discussions around a number of new ones. He also reported on other matters related to the administration of centres and institutes such as ensuring that staff categories are appropriate to attract and retain good people and how centres and institutes relate to signature areas. The Chair noted that the reduction in the number of centres and institutes in recent years is indicative of a more rigorous way of implementing institutional policies and not of a decline in activities. A member commented on the success of the model used within the Faculty of Arts to bring together the Directors and Dr Goebel acknowledged the coherence provided by this model and indicated that it was being used as an example to develop similar structures in other Faculties.",

Discussion: Deputy Provost Wendy Rodgers provided an update on the current process which will fulfill the CAQC (Campus Alberta Quality Council) requirement for a 5 to 7 year cycle of reviews. She noted that each Faculty had input on how they wished to schedule the reviews with some choosing to review all of their programs at once, while others chose to spread out the reviews, doing a number of programs each year. Dr Rodgers noted that the President’s Visiting Committees (PVCs) were conducted at the Faculty level and provided a strategic and research focus and long term planning. She reported that 10 to 14 reviews would be conducted across the University annually and that staff were now in place centrally to provide data and logistical support for these reviews. During the discussion on this matter, members enquired about the scheduling and length of these various reviews, the associated costs, student involvement in the activities, and the level of expertise needed to review certain programs.",

The report is also provided to the Board \nLearning and Discovery Committee for information.  \nTimeline/Implementation Date n/a \nSupplementary Notes and \ncontext \nRandy Goebel assumed the Chair of CIC on September 1, 2015. In this \nrole, Dr Goebel has taken up responsibilities with centres and institutes, \ninstitutional policies around commercialization, the institutional plan as it \npertains to research excellence, and other strategic initiatives. \nAs CIC Chair, Dr Goebel ensures the integrity and maintenance of the \nUniversity’s rigorous processes for the establishment, operation, \ntermination, oversight and accountability of centres and institutes and \nmaintains close communication with Deans and Vice-Presidents, as well \nas with Directors responsible for the daily oversight of academic and \naffiliated centres and institutes at the University of Alberta.   \nIn late 2014, the Faculty of Arts leveraged administrative and technical \nsupport (including the research computing and multimedia expertise of \nArts Resource Centre) in order to encourage existing and develop new \nforms of research collaboration, including centres and institutes, in Arts. \nOliver Rossier was appointed Senior Officer in charge of this “meta-\nconstruct” – Arts Collaboration Enterprise (ACE) – in January 2015. ACE \nhas been an extremely effective tool for marshalling energy and ideas \nwithin the Faculty and within the Faculty’s centres and institutes. Over \nthe last year, Dr Goebel has been actively encouraging other faculties \nwith large numbers of centres and institutes to review and adopt a similar \nmeta-construct.  \nIn the 2015-2016 reporting period, the Centres and Institutes Committee \ncontinued to meet on an ad hoc basis as issues requiring the group’s \ncollective and separate areas of expertise were required. This model is \nfavoured by the Committee and functions efficiently and effectively for \nthe Committee and its constituents. \nEngagement and Routing (Include meeting dates) \nParticipation: \n(parties who have seen the \nproposal and in what capacity) \nThose who have been informed: \n• Centres and Institutes Committee – January 19, 2017 \n• Vice-Provosts’ Council – January 23, 2017 \n• President’s Executive Committee-Operations (PEC-O) – January \nItem No. 4 \nGFC ACADEMIC PLANNING COMMITTEE \nFor the Meeting of March 8, 2017 \n <For further information see \nthe link posted on \nthe Governance Toolkit section \nStudent Participation Protocol> \n26, 2017 \n• Board Audit Committee – February 27, 2017 \n• Board Learning and Discovery Committee – February 27, 2017 \n• GFC Academic Planning Committee – March 8, 2017 \nThose who have been consulted: \n•  \nThose who are actively participating: \n•  \nAlignment/Compliance \nAlignment with Guiding \nDocuments \nFor the Public Good - University of Alberta Institutional Strategic Plan \nENGAGE: GOAL: Engage communities across our campuses, city and \nregion, province, nation and the world to create reciprocal, mutually \nbeneficial learning experiences, research projects, partnerships, and \ncollaborations.    \nEXCEL: Objective 11: Advance the University of Alberta’s reputation for \nresearch excellence by pursuing fundamental and original questions and \nideas, pushing the frontiers of knowledge, inspiring creative \nexperimentation, driving innovation, and advancing society. \nCompliance with Legislation, \nPolicy and/or Procedure \nRelevant to the Proposal \n(please quote legislation and \ninclude identifying section \nnumbers) \nPost-Secondary Learning Act (PSLA): The Government of \nAlberta’s Post-Secondary Learning Act gives the Board of Governors \nthe authority to “develop, manage and operate, alone or in co-\noperation with any person or organization, programs, services and \nfacilities for the education or cultural advancement of the people of \nAlberta” (section 60(1)).  \nPost-Secondary Learning Act (PSLA): The Post-Secondary \nLearning Act (PSLA) gives General Faculties Council (GFC) \nresponsibility, subject to the authority of the Board of Governors, over \n\"academic affairs\" (section 26(1)). Section 26(1)(o) provides that GFC \nmay make recommendations to the Board of Governors on a number of \nmatters, including \"the budget\" and \"academic planning.\" GFC has thus \nestablished an Academic Planning Committee (GFC APC), as set out \nbelow. GFC delegates certain of its powers to the GFC Academic \nPlanning Committee. The complete wording of the section(s) of the \nPSLA, as referred to above, and any other related sections, should be \nchecked in any instance where formal jurisdiction or delegation needs to \nbe determined. \nUAPPL Centres and Institutes Policy \nUAPPOL Academic Centres and Institutes Establishment Procedure \n[…] \nSection 2: ESTABLISHMENT  \n“All proposals for establishment of affiliated centres and institutes shall \nbe submitted initially to the Provost and Vice-President (Academic) for \nassessment.
