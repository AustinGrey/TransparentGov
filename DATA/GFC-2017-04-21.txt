Ms Herman reported that the Teaching Staff Agreement would replace the current CAS:T Agreement and would enhance conditions of those who are temporary staff. It would establish career progression through the ranks similar to that in the faculty agreement. She explained that Faculties would need to establish specific evaluation standards.",

            "Presenter": "Mark Loewen, Chair and Steve Patten, Vice-Chair – Ad Hoc Committee on Academic Governance Including Delegated Authority ",
            "Description": "Purpose of the Proposal: The approval of these guiding documents will inform future work for the academic governing body and are critical foundational documents. The Report of the ad hoc Committee on Academic Governance Including Delegated Authority presents recommendations for academic governance reform and sets forth a plan for how members can continue the work and be engaged participants in the academic governance process. Discussion: The Chair noted that Objective 21 of For the Public Good refers to refreshing and building good governance; and that this report represents a transformative process for academic governance at the university that will set a template for the evolution of GFC for years to come. The Chair noted that GFC has received regular updates of the work of the ad hoc committee and thanked the members of the ad hoc committee for their work on this project over the last seven months. He reported that more work would be required in the coming months to refine committee terms of reference and to develop and implement strategies recommended in the report. He then invited the ad hoc Committee Chair, Dr Mark Loewen, and Vice-Chair, Dr Steve Patten, to speak to the report. Dr Loewen and Dr Pattern provided an overview of the ad hoc committee’s deliberations and the process involved in arriving at the recommendations presented. They noted that the guiding principles for the ad hoc committee were approved by GFC in November 2016, that ideas contained in the report were developed and revised over the seven month period, and that the ad hoc committee was driven by what it heard and by the deadlines it operated under. As a foundational part of its work, the ad hoc committee developed four foundational documents which inform the recommendations, including revisions to standing committee terms of reference, and provide guidlenes to direct the remaining work outlined in the recommendations. These documents also serve as the basis for future efforts to evaluate and improve academic governance at the university. Dr Loewen and Dr Patten provided an overview of each of these four documents: • Principles for Delegation of Authority • Principles for Standing Committee Composition • Roles and Responsibilities of Members • Meeting Procedural Rules During the discussion of the proposed procedural rules, Dr Patten emphasized that the focus was on a process that would lead to inclusive and respectful dialogue routed in a level of informality that would allow for a degree of flexibiity that, with leadership from the Chair, would facilitate rather than impede debate. In discussing committee composition, members commented on the principle of having greater representation by GFC members on committees and the implications to individual member workload, and to diverse and broad representation on committees. Dr Lowen noted that the principle was developed to provide a closer connection between GFC and its committees, one of the core issues which had been identified. He also noted that the principle should be employed whenever possible; and that the ad hoc committee recognized that there could be exceptions due to the specific mandate of some committees. GFC discussed the addition of ‘research’ to the name of the current GFC Academic Planning Committee (APC) and to make its mandate on research policy more explicit. GFC also discussed attendance expectations and video conferencing, and the reinvigoration of the Council on Student Affairs (COSA). GFC members congratulated and thanked the ad hoc committee for the report and recommendations. The Chair noted that further work would be required in the coming months by standing committees and other groups, and would also include further consultations on some items. He noted that these items will come before GFC for approval in due course. A transition committee, including members of the GFC Executive Committee and the ad hoc committee, would oversee this work for completion by April 2019. The Chair thanked members of the ad hoc Committee for their work on this important matter so vital to the university.",

In April, 2014, the Board provided Administration with a mandate to: \n(1) Develop a University-wide academic performance evaluation and career progression model which \nwould demonstrate the University’s commitment to a teaching-intensive career path within the CAS:T \nAgreement; and \n(2) Establish greater position security by adopting a “contingent” appointment option for CAS:T \nAgreement staff members. \nThe work of the ARC has now brought us to the completion of the new Agreement and below are \nhighlights of the ATS Agreement (in contrast to the CAS:T Agreement that it will replace). Following Board \nand GFC Approval and AASUA ratification, the new Agreement will be implemented on July 1, 2017. \nSeveral Faculties have already adopted a Teaching Intensive Model under CAS:T with multi-year fixed or \nrolling terms (Arts, Business, FoMD – Dentistry, Nursing, Pharmacy, Physical Ed & Rec, Rehab Medicine, \nand Science). These Faculties will now be able to transition to the ATS Agreements, utilizing the \nappointment categories outlined. There will be no ability to hire into rolling terms but that job security is \nmaintained and enhanced through the introduction of the “contingent” appointment option. \nACADEMIC TEACHING STAFF (ATS) AGREEMENT \nDefinitions/ \nArticle/Appendix \nChange \n1.15 Senior Officer - Definition of administrators who have authority under the Agreement, and \nwhen read in conjunction with 4.3 (Delegation) clarifies the delegation of \nresponsibilities. \n1.16 Staff Member - This is a more descriptive definition of staff members who fall under the \nAgreement and broadens the funding sources that can be used. \n6. APPOINTMENTS \n- Each Faculty/Department will develop position profiles that describe the \nteaching workload and other University responsibilities. \n- This Agreement establishes ranks and standards (Full Lecturer, Associate \nLecturer, Assistant Lecturer and Instructor) with working titles continuing to \nbe Faculty-specific or with the option of using the ranks as the working \ntitles. \n- Provides the ability to hire into a full or part-time Term or Term Recurring  \nappointment to a maximum of 6 years in length where lay-off provision \ncontinues to apply for contracts greater than 12 months with 3 months’ \nnotice plus 1 month severance for each year of service to a maximum of 9 \nmonths; OR INTO \n- Provides the ability to hire into a full or part-time Career Status \nappointment where the contract does not specify an end date but is subject \nto termination as a result of: (1) duties of the position profile are no longer \nrequired; or (2) the position profile has changed and the staff member no \nlonger has the qualifications required to carry out the responsibilities; or (3) \nThe funding for the appointment is insufficient or is no longer available. The \nAppointee will receive no less than 12 months’ notice of termination. \n- Administration has committed to developing University-wide guidelines \nregarding: (1) procedures outlining the conversion of a Term appointment to \na Term Recurring of Career Status appointment and (2) factors which \ndetermine when funding for a Career Status appointment is no longer \navailable. \n- Provides more clarity regarding recruitment, advertising and “first \nconsideration” of current staff for appointments. \n7. RESPONSIBILITIES \nTO THE UNIVERSITY \n- Language more specifically tailored to this Agreement and encompassing \nteaching and teaching-related responsibilities. \n8. SUPPLEMENTARY \nPROFESSIONAL \nACTIVITY \n- Language more specifically tailored to this Agreement.

UNSATISFACTORY \nAND UNACCEPTABLE \nPERFORMANCE \n- Language derived from Faculty Agreement to address performance \nissues. \n12. NOTICE PERIOD \nAND LAY-OFF \n- No change from current provisions for staff members with Term Status \nwhere lay-off provision applies for contracts greater than 12 months – 3 \nmonths’ notice plus 1 month severance for each year of service to a \nmaximum of 9 months. \n- Introduction of contingent clause from Faculty Agreement for staff \nmembers with Career Status (12 months’ notice of termination). \n24.

The instructor relationship is \nadded to the University system once an instructor’s employee ID is attached to a class. \nThe start date of the relationship coincides with the date that the course catalogue is \nreleased to campus. The end date of the relationship is the end date of the last term that \nthe instructor is attached to a course/courses + four months.  \nEmployees (EMP) = An employee is someone who has an employment relationship with \nthe University. All employees will have other simultaneous relationships that further \ndescribe their affiliation with the University (e.g., Student or Instructor). The employee \nrelationship is given to all persons that have an active job record in the University system \nThe start and end date of the relationship coincides with the start and end date of the \nemployment contract.  \nACCESS TO LICENSED ONLINE LIBRARY CONTENT \nThe University Libraries licenses a wide range of electronic journals, e-books, \nabstracting/indexing databases and numerical databases from commercial vendors. These \nlicenses restrict use of these resources to primary members of the University community, i.e. \ncurrent University students, faculty and staff (based on valid student or employee numbers). \nHowever, University Libraries licenses do permit \"walk-in\"/on-campus use by guest affiliates and \nthe wider community at public computer stations within the University Libraries or via the UWS. \nREMOTE ACCESS TO LICENSED ONLINE LIBRARY CONTENT  \nRemote access (from outside the University computing network) to licensed online library content \nby primary members of the University community requires login to the Library's EZproxy server \nusing a CCID. \nThe search for information from off campus begins within the University Libraries website \nat http://www.library.ualberta.ca. Ebooks, ejournals, databases, streaming video or audio, etc. \ncan be searched through various services within the website and before being linked through to \nthe content, the searcher will be passed to the Libraries EZproxy service to login with CCID and \npassword.  \nLIBRARY CARDS AND BORROWING PRIVILEGES \nStaff members will use a University Staff ONEcard to borrow Library resources with a 4-month \nloan period for 14 months from the start date of their employment contract. \nhttp://www.library.ualberta.ca/remote/index.cfm\nhttp://ist.ualberta.ca/id\nhttp://www.library.ualberta.ca/\nPage | 8 of                         MAR’10’2017 \nAPPENDIX D: \nConditions for Supplementary Professional Activities (SPA) \n1. The authority and approval of SPA is subject to the following conditions: \na) The staff member shall not compete unfairly with professionals outside the University. \nb) The SPA shall not infringe upon the University’s conflict policy and related procedures and \nprotocols, as amended from time to time. \nc) The SPA shall conform with the University’s related policies, procedures and protocols \nrelated to the use of University facilities and staff, as amended from time to time. \n d) The staff member shall indemnify and hold harmless the University from and against any \nloss, injury or damage which the University may or could suffer arising in any way out of or \nin relation to such activities. The staff member gives this covenant and makes this \nagreement notwithstanding that the University has participated in such activities by the \nprovision of facilities, space, equipment, or administrative assistance, unless the said loss, \ninjury or damage arises directly from a malfunction of the said facilities or equipment which \nis not caused by the user thereof; and notwithstanding that the University has participated \nin such SPA by the provision of students or postdoctoral fellows or the like; and \nnotwithstanding that any formal contract with respect to those SPA has not been negotiated \nby or approved by the University. \ne) When engaged in SPA a staff member shall not use the name of the University in any way, \nexcept as the mailing address, nor shall the staff member hold himself or herself to be an \nagent of the University when engaged in SPA. \n2. SPA shall be taken into account in the evaluation of a staff member’s performance for increments \nand promotion.    \n3. The following information shall be provided in the staff member’s annual statement on SPA: \n a) the category or type of client or affiliation; \n b) the nature of services performed; \n c) an estimate of the total time devoted to each SPA; and \n d) the names and nature of any continuing contractual arrangements with outside \norganizations. \n4. SPA shall represent an integral part of the responsibility to relate theory to practice, thereby \nenabling teaching to remain professionally relevant. Routine, repetitive and trivial SPA is \ndiscouraged. \nRequired SPA \n5. A Faculty Council may deem SPA, and the maintenance of a professional license, to be essential \nto the work of the Department and to the progress of a staff member’s career. In such cases the \nDean and Department Chair shall encourage SPA. \n6. Where a Faculty Council has deemed SPA to be essential to the work of the Department, the \nFaculty Council shall recommend to the Board that such SPA be considered as part of the primary \nUniversity responsibilities. The Board may approve such recommendations on such conditions as it \ndeems appropriate, having regard to 1.a. \nMajor SPA \n7. SPA may be categorized as major or minor in scope. Each Faculty Council shall decide what \nconstitutes major SPA but all proposals to teach at another institution shall be considered major \nSPA. \nPage | 9 of                         MAR’10’2017 \nReporting Requirements \n8.

Decisions reached by a Faculty Council under this Article shall be conveyed, in writing, to the \nProvost and the Association. \nFaculty Regulations \n13. Each Faculty Council shall develop regulations with respect to SPA.  The regulations and any \namendments thereto shall be filed with the Provost and the Association. The regulations shall \ninclude: \na) The definition of what constitutes major SPA. \nb) The format for the annual statement of SPA; the determination of the time period covered \nby the report;  the date by which the report is to be submitted and whether the annual \nstatement about SPA shall be included in the annual report. \nc) Any modifications to the requirement that SPA be taken into account in the evaluation of a \nstaff member’s performance. \nd) Whether the time of year, week or day when SPA is performed is important to its approval \nand reporting. \ne) Whether the annual statement shall include information about remuneration received from \nSPA. \nf) Regulations governing the use of University facilities and staff for SPA including \narrangements to reimburse the University for such use. \ng) What evidence shall be required to ensure the staff member has adequate personal liability \ninsurance to indemnify the University against any claims. \nh) Such additional terms and conditions the Faculty Council may consider necessary; such \nterms and conditions shall be in addition to and not in contradiction to this Appendix. \nPage | 10 of                         MAR’10’2017 \nAPPENDIX E: \nSALARY SCHEDULE \n[Link] \nBENEFITS SCHEDULE \n[Link] \nREMOVAL GRANT REGULATIONS \n[Link] \nAPPENDIX F: \nCOPYRIGHT REGULATIONS (2016) \n1. Ownership \n1.1 Pursuant to 24.2 of the Agreement, a staff member who creates a Work resulting from or \nconnected with the staff member’s duties or employment owns copyright in the Work.  \nHowever, the University owns or has an interest in Works as provided in 1.4 to 1.7 inclusive, \n2.1 to 2.10 inclusive, 3.1, 5.1, and 5.2 of this Appendix. \n1.2 For the purposes of this Appendix and Article 24 of the Agreement, “Work” or “Works” means \nanything in which copyright subsists pursuant to the Copyright Act (Canada), whether \npublished or unpublished. For greater certainty, Work includes: architectural works, artistic \nworks, choreographic works, cinematographic works, collective works, dramatic works, literary \nworks, musical works, compilations, performers’ performances, sound recordings and \ncommunication signals, all as defined in the Copyright Act (Canada). \n1.3 A creator has moral rights in a Work, as provided under the Copyright Act. The Parties endorse \nand support the creator’s right to manage those moral rights. \n1.4 If a staff member creates a Work \n(a) in the course of performing administrative or management duties or activities for the \nUniversity, a Department, or a Faculty, including all units therein associated (e.g., \nCentres and Institutes); or \n(b) for the purposes of a committee or group of a Department, Faculty, or the University; \nthen the University owns copyright in the Work. \n1.5 If a staff member creates a Work pursuant to a written agreement between the staff member \nand the University, that agreement shall address the University’s arrangement with the staff \nmember regarding ownership or other interest in that Work.  \n1.6 If a staff member creates a Work under a sponsored research funding agreement with a third \nparty funder, copyright ownership and licensing are governed by the terms of the sponsored \nresearch funding agreement. Because the University shall enter into the sponsored research \nfunding agreement with the sponsor, the University has the right to obtain from the staff \nmember an assignment or licence of the copyright as necessary to fulfill its obligations to the \nsponsor under the sponsored research funding agreement.  However, the staff member cannot \nPage | 11 of                         MAR’10’2017 \nunilaterally assign or licence Works that are not wholly owned or created by that staff \nmember. \n1.7       If a staff member creates a Work under any other agreement between the University and a \nthird party, including but not limited to a secondment agreement or facility access agreement, \ncopyright ownership and licensing are governed by the terms of the agreement between the \nUniversity and the third party. To avoid any need for the staff member personally to transfer \nor agree to transfer rights relating to the Work to the third party (which may entail the \npersonal liability of the staff member), the University has the right to obtain from the staff \nmember an assignment or licence of the copyright as necessary to fulfill its obligations to the \nthird party under the agreement. However, the staff member cannot unilaterally assign or \nlicence Works that are not wholly owned or created by that staff member. \n2 University Licence  \nGeneral Principles \n2.1   Subject to 2.2 to 2.10 inclusive, the University is and shall be entitled to an immediate, non-\nexclusive, royalty-free, non-transferable, irrevocable licence to use any Work created or \nproduced by a staff member that results from or is connected with the staff member’s duties \nor employment, for all purposes within the University’s approved mandate pursuant to the \nPost-Secondary Learning Act (Alberta). \n2.2   The purposes referred to in 2.1 include, but are not be limited to, unit accreditation, unit or \nUniversity marketing, and any not-for-profit activity.  \n2.3 The licence contemplated by 2.1 does not apply if, as a result of reasonable academic or \npedagogical publishing practice, a staff member must assign copyright to a Work to a third \nparty as a condition of publication. In such a case, the staff member shall make best efforts to \ncause the third party to provide a licence to the University in relation to the Work, such licence \ncontaining terms that are analogous to those described in 2.1. \n2.4   The licence contemplated by 2.1 does not preclude a staff member from agreeing with the \nUniversity to grant any additional licence or other rights in and to a Work to the University.  \n2.5 A staff member, reasonably believing that his or her Work is unsatisfactory for a proposed use \ndue to outdating, incompleteness, negative impact on the professional reputation of the staff \nmember, or other academic grounds, may amend the Work or require that its use be withheld. \nLimited Exception – Works Created to Fulfill Assigned Course Responsibilities \n2.6 Except in the cases described in 2.7 to 2.10 inclusive, the licence contemplated by 2.1 does not \napply to any Work created by a staff member to fulfill assigned course responsibilities under \nArticles 8.01 and 8.03 of the Agreement. \n2.7   The licence contemplated by 2.1 includes those elements of a course outline that set out the \ninformation required by General Faculties Council policy, as described in the University \nCalendar. \n2.8 If a staff member is unable or unavailable to deliver all or part of a course duly assigned to that \nstaff member, the University may use the Work described in 2.6 to complete the delivery of \nPage | 12 of                         MAR’10’2017 \nthe course. Such a licence will not be irrevocable, but instead will be for the duration of the \ncourse in that academic year. \n2.9   The University may use a Work described in 2.6 for the purposes of unit accreditation, in \nconnection with transfer credit determinations or as the University may be required to meet \nits obligations to students. \n2.10 If a staff member is assigned course responsibilities under Article 8.03 of the Agreement that \nentail the preparation of course materials for use in multiple courses or courses taught in \nmultiple sections, the licence contemplated by 2.1 applies to those materials for a term of \nthree (3) years from the date that the materials are last revised by the staff member and it \nshall not be an interference in the creator’s moral rights for the University to modify the \ncourse materials as required for the purpose of keeping them current. \n3. Computer Programs and the University Patent Policy \n3.1 In addition to this Appendix, the University Patent Policy shall apply to a computer program \nthat is patentable intellectual property. \n4.  Conflict of Interest and Conflict of Commitment \n4.1 The University has an interest in ensuring that Works created by its own staff members are not \nused to compete with or undermine the University’s educational mission or activities. \nTherefore, a staff member's creation and use of Works in which the staff member owns \ncopyright remain subject to the University's conflict of interest and conflict of commitment \npolicies. \n5. Collaborative Works \n5.1 Works created collaboratively by students, staff, faculty and/or others present special \nchallenges with regard to copyright. Such works may be owned in whole or in part by the \nUniversity, or the University may have rights in and to those Works if they fall within one of the \ncategories described in 1.4 to 1.7 inclusive, 2.1 to 2.10 inclusive, or 3.1 of this Appendix.  \n5.2 Subject to 1.4 to 1.7 inclusive, 2.1 to 2.10 inclusive, or 3.1 of this Appendix, if a Work is created \nby a staff member and one or more other individuals governed by University collective \nagreements, policies, and procedures, as between the University and that staff member and \nthe individual or individuals, each person’s rights and obligations relating to the Work shall be \ndetermined by the applicable University collective agreements, policies, and procedures. In the \ncase of some collaborative Works, especially those involving members of different categories \nof persons within the University community, the parties involved may decide to assign \ncopyright to the University in order to coordinate distribution, use, and (when appropriate) \nrevenue sharing. \n5.3 If a Work is created by a staff member and an individual or individuals who are not subject to \nUniversity collective agreements, policies, and procedures, ownership of copyright will be \ndecided in accordance with: \n(a)   a written agreement between that staff member and that individual or those individuals;  \n(b)  a written agreement between the University and another organization; or \nPage | 13 of                         MAR’10’2017 \n(c) in the absence of an agreement contemplated by (a) or (b), in accordance with the \ngeneral law, except that this Appendix will apply to any interest held by the staff \nmember, with the necessary changes. \n6, Guidelines \n6.1 The University may publish guidelines, recommendations, and explanatory notes which shall \nnot form part of this Appendix, to assist staff members and others to structure collaborations \nin ways that maximize certainty and minimize conflicts respecting interests in Works, and to \nassist in the application or use of this Appendix. \nAPPENDIX G: \nPATENT POLICY \nPage | 14 of                         MAR’10’2017 \n1.

Inventions Covered \nThis Policy shall apply to all Inventions including those made under grants, sponsorships, \ncontracts or agreements approved by the University. The Policy shall not apply to Inventions \nmade by Inventors in the course of demonstrably private research unrelated to their University \nduties or in the course of their activities as consultants to outside bodies, when such research or \nactivities do not involve use of University facilities or resources. \n6. Administration of the Policy \nThe Director shall be responsible for the administration of this Policy. \n7. Patent Alternatives \n7.1 An Inventor who makes an Invention and wishes to apply for a patent may, except as \nprovided in Paragraph 10 of this Policy, do so as an individual independent of the \nUniversity, or may do so through the University, as set out in these procedures. \n7.2 Any Inventor who makes an Invention must submit to the Intellectual Property and \nContracts Office an ROI which contains a full description of the Invention. The Inventor \nPage | 15 of                         MAR’10’2017 \nmust complete the section indicating whether or not the Inventor wishes to proceed \nindependently of the University or wishes to proceed through the University. \n7.3 While the Inventor may file a caveat as an intended applicant for a patent under the Patent \nAct (Canada) as soon as the ROI is submitted to the Director, the Inventor shall not enter \ninto any commitments outside the University aimed at patenting, assigning  or licensing the \ninvention for thirty (30) calendar days after such submission. This will enable \nrepresentatives of the Intellectual Property and Contracts Office to discuss with the Inventor \nthe Invention and its proposed applications and commercialization. \n8. Application Through the University \n8.1 If the Inventor offers to assign the Invention to the University, the Inventors ROI shall be \nreviewed by the Patents and Licensing Committee (see Paragraph 14 below), which shall \ndecide whether to accept assignment of the Invention. \n8.2 If the University decides to accept the assignment, it shall then assume the responsibility \nfor obtaining patents, the negotiation of assignments or licenses, and the taking of \nwhatever other steps are deemed necessary by the University for the commercialization of \nthe Invention without cost to the Inventor. \n8.3 The Director shall consult with the Inventor on how best to facilitate public use and \ncommercial application of the Invention.  In general, patent applications will be filed only in \nCanada or the United States of America.  Thereafter the University will attempt to verify the \ncommercial opportunities for the Invention before deciding whether to file in additional \ncountries or to incur additional expenses. \n8.4 If the decision is not to accept the assignment, or if no decision is made by the Patents and \nLicensing Committee within four (4) months from the date of submission of the ROI, or such \nearlier or later time may be agreed upon by the University and the Inventor, the Inventor \nmay, by notifying the Director in writing, recover full ownership of the Invention and proceed \nat the Inventors own discretion and own expense, pursuant to Paragraph 9 but without the \nthirty (30) calendar day waiting period. \n8.5 The University shall remit to the Inventor not later than 15 June each year a statement \nreporting all relevant actions taken in respect of the Invention during the previous University \nfiscal year, such as the issue of a patent, the conclusion of a licensing agreement or the \nlike; and reporting further the name and places of all establishments using the Invention \nunder license; and reporting further all expenditures and income forming part of the \ncalculation of Net Income for that year.  The University shall also, not later than 15 June, \nremit to the Inventor a sum equal to 33-% of the  Ne t Income for the previous fiscal year. \n8.6 If at any time after having accepted assignment of an Invention, the University determines \nthat it is not feasible to continue the commercialization of an Invention, and it has not \noutstanding contractual license or assignment obligations to third parties with respect to the \nInvention, it may reassign the Invention and any patent, or patent application relating \nthereto, to the Inventor, in which instance the Invention shall be treated as an Invention of \nwhich the Patent and Licensing Committee has pursuant to paragraph 8.4 determined not \nto accept an assignment. \n9. Application Independently of University \n9.1 When permitted pursuant to Paragraph 7 or Paragraph 8.4, the Inventor may proceed \nindependently of the University, or arrange with any outside sponsor of the Inventors \nchoice, to obtain patents for the Invention, to negotiate licenses, and otherwise to take \nwhatever steps the Inventor deems necessary for the commercialization of the Invention.  \nAll such steps shall be taken at the Inventor’s, or the Inventor’s sponsors expense. \nPage | 16 of                         MAR’10’2017 \n9.2 The University acknowledges that the Invention shall be owned by the Inventor and, except \nfor the obligations set forth in paragraph 9.3 below, the University shall have no other rights \nin respect of such Invention. \n9.3 The continuing obligations of the Inventor under this option shall be: \na) to provide the University with an annual statement, not later than 15 June of each \nyear, containing the information set out in paragraph 8.5 above; \nb) to maintain in Alberta proper records of the matters referred to in a) above and to \npermit the University access to the records for each year for a period of twenty-four \n(24) months following completion of that year. \nc) to remit to the University, with the annual statement, the sum equal to 33 1/3% of the \nNet Income for the previous fiscal year. \n10. Compulsory Application Through the University for Multi-Inventors \nIf more than one Inventor is involved in making an Invention, and if there is no other agreement \nbetween the Inventors, the Invention must be offered for patenting and commercialization through \nthe University, as contemplated in Paragraph 8.  In cases involving multi-Inventors, the Patent \nand Licensing Committee, after consultation with the Inventors, shall approve the list of Inventors \nand shall determine the relative royalty apportionment for the individuals concerned.  This level of \napportionment will be commensurate with the level of contribution of each.  If the Inventors wish \nto appeal the decision of the Committee in respect to the list of Inventors or to the royalty \napportionment, the procedures set out in section 14.3 shall apply. \n11. Variation to Net Income Apportionment \nNotwithstanding any provision of paragraphs 8 or 9 of this Policy, the University and the Inventor \nmay, with respect to an Invention, enter into an agreement in which responsibility for, and cost of, \npatenting and commercializing such Invention are dealt with in a manner different than provided \nin such paragraphs and in which Net Income is apportioned in a manner different from that \nprovided in these sections. \n12. Review of Patent Policy \nThe Patent Policy will be reviewed at least every five (5) years by the Patents and Licensing \nCommittee to keep it abreast of the needs of the University.  The review date will be based on the \ndate of the Policy coming into force. \n13. Assigned Inventions and Patents \nCertain contracts, grants, sponsorships and research agreements which have been or will be \nentered into by the University, on its behalf or on behalf of certain of its members, with industrial \ncompanies, government agencies and other bodies, may contain provisions in respect of \nInventions and patents, whereby all patent rights are assigned or licensed to such companies, \nagencies and other bodies or assigned to the University and licensed to such companies, \nagencies and other bodies, and may contain provisions which are at variance with the provisions \nof this Policy.  The provisions of such contracts, grants, sponsorships and research agreements \nshall supersede the other provisions of this Policy. The University retains the right to enter into \nsuch agreements, and requires that University members comply with such provisions in contracts, \ngrants, sponsorships, or research agreements. \n14. Patents and Licensing Committee (Terms of Reference Attached) \n14.1 The Patents and Licensing Committee shall consist of the Associate Vice-President \n(Research), the Director, one person appointed by the University Research Policy \nCommittee, one person appointed by the AAS:UA, and one person appointed by the \nPage | 17 of                         MAR’10’2017 \nAdvisory Committee of the Office of Intellectual Property and Contracts. The Committee \nchooses its own Chair. \n14.2 In the event that a meeting of the Patents and Licensing Committee or its executive is held \nto make a decision respecting a particular ROI, as referred to in Paragraph 8.1 of this \npolicy, the Inventor and the Inventor’s Dean and Department Chair will be invited to attend \nthe meeting and will have the opportunity to state their views. \n14.3 If an Inventor or group of Inventors decides to appeal a decision of the Patents and \nLicensing Committee, the appeal shall be heard by a one person arbitration board, the \narbitrator being chosen by the Provost. \n14.4 If two parties in a Multi-Inventor patent dispute the relative apportionment of royalties, the \ndispute shall be heard by a three person arbitration board.  Each party shall select a \nrepresentative to the board and those two persons shall select a third person to chair the \nboard.  Where the two representatives cannot agree on a third person, the third person \nshall be chosen by the Provost. \n15. Commitment to University Research \nA portion of Net Income shall be used to support research at the University, with special \nrecognition being given to the Faculty, Department, or the laboratory in which the Invention \noriginated.  The University will commit a portion of its Net Income to this end and encourages \nUniversity Inventors to do the same. \nPage | 18 of                         MAR’10’2017 \nAPPENDIX H: \nDetailed Procedures on Evaluation and Promotion \n[to be developed in accordance with Appendix I] \nPage | 19 of                         MAR’10’2017 \nAPPENDIX I: \nINTERPRETATION AND TRANSITION \nThe parties agree that: \n1.

Four documents were \ndeveloped, for immediate approval by GFC. These documents are \nItem No. 6 \nGENERAL FACULTIES COUNCIL \nFor the Meeting of April 21, 2017 \nintended to guide the implementation of the committee’s \nrecommendations, including revisions to standing committee terms of \nreference, and also serve as the basis for future efforts to evaluate and \nimprove academic governance at the University of Alberta. The four \ndocuments to be presented for approval address the following matters:  \n• Principles for  Delegation of Authority \n• Principles for Standing Committee Composition \n• Roles and Responsibilities of Members \n• Meeting Procedural Rules  \nGFC is asked to endorse and approve in principle the oversight, work \nand implementation of the recommendations as set forth in the Report of \nthe Ad Hoc Committee on Academic Governance Including Delegated \nAuthority.  Endorsement and approval in principle is important because \nultimately it means that GFC and committee members will be working on \nthe governing documents – the members will be doing this work. \nIn addition, to ensure that the recommendations in the report will be \ncompleted, and to facilitate a smooth transition, as suggested in the \nreport, GFC Executive Committee will oversee and facilitate the \nimplementation of the recommendations on or before April 2019.  \nThe Impact of the Proposal is The approval of these guiding documents will inform future work for the \nacademic governing body and are critical foundational documents. The \nReport of the Ad Hoc Committee on Academic Governance Including \nDelegated Authority presents recommendations for academic \ngovernance reform and sets forth a plan for how members can continue \nthe work and be engaged participants in the academic governance \nprocess.   \nThe endorsement and approval in principle of the recommendations \npresented in the Report of the Ad Hoc Committee on Academic \nGovernance Including Delegated Authority will set the course for the \nongoing renewal of academic governance, give oversight of this process \nto GFC Executive, and provide implementation timelines for renewal.  \nThe endorsement and approval in principle of the draft GFC Standing \nCommittee Terms of Reference will enable further work on these terms \nover the timelines outlined.  \nThe recommendation of a transition process will ensure the work initiated \nby the Ad Hoc Committee on Academic Governance Including Delegated \nAuthority will be completed on or before April 2019. \nReplaces/Revises (eg, policies, \nresolutions) \nThe GFC Roles and Responsibilities of Members and GFC Meeting \nProcedural Rules revise elements of the GFC Terms of Reference and \nthe General Terms of Reference for GFC Standing Committees.  Once \napproved, the revised documents are clear and consistent and will form \npart of the overall governing documents.   \nTimeline/Implementation Date The guiding documents will take effect upon approval at GFC on April \n21, 2017 and be used to guide implementation of the recommendations \nof the Report of the Ad Hoc Committee on Academic Governance \nIncluding Delegated Authority along with any future renewal of academic \ngovernance. \nThe implementation of the recommendations presented in the report will \nItem No. 6 \nGENERAL FACULTIES COUNCIL \nFor the Meeting of April 21, 2017 \nbe carried out as per the timelines offered in the report. \nThe draft GFC Standing Committee Terms of Reference will replace the \ncurrent Terms of Reference upon their final approval by GFC as per the \ntimelines outlined. \nEstimated Cost and funding \nsource \nTo be determined.  \nNext Steps (ie.: \nCommunications Plan, \nImplementation plans) \nUpon approval at GFC, the Report of the Ad Hoc Committee on \nAcademic Governance Including Delegated Authority will proceed to the \nimplementation phase.  \nUpon approval by GFC, a transition will be established to continue this \nwork and conclude no later than April 2019. \nSupplementary Notes and \ncontext \nGFC established Ad Hoc Committee on Academic Governance including \nDelegated Authority in September 26, 2016 ‘to draft revised Terms of \nReference of GFC and all GFC Standing Committees, updating \ndelegated authorities for recommendation to GFC by April 30, 2017” and \napproved the tasks outlined in the committee’s terms of reference.  The \ncommittee has met bi-weekly since the beginning of October to \nunderstand the issues and develop appropriate recommendations to \naddress them. \nEngagement and Routing (Include meeting dates) \nParticipation: \n(parties who have seen the \nproposal and in what capacity) \n<For further information see \nthe link posted on the \nGovernance Toolkit section \nStudent Participation Protocol> \nThose who have been informed: \n• University Community \nThose who have been consulted: \n• See attached list of consultations (Attachment 3) \nThose who are actively participating: \n• Members of the Ad Hoc Committee on Academic Governance \nincluding Delegated Authority \n• University Governance \nApproval Route (Governance) \n(including meeting dates) \nGFC Executive – April 10, 2017 \nGeneral Faculties Council – April 21, 2017 \nFinal Approver General Faculties Council \nAlignment/Compliance \nAlignment with Guiding \nDocuments \nFor the Public Good \nInstitutional Values \nThe University of Alberta community of students, faculty, staff, and \nalumni rely on shared, deeply held values that guide behaviour and \nactions.

Delegation is essential to ensure timely and efficient decision-making in \nsmaller forums with access to appropriate resource people, while allowing GFC to focus on \nsubstantive and strategic issues of broad relevance to the university community.  The following \noffers guidance to this delegation structure and helps maintain accountability, transparency, and \ncollegiality in the academic governance system at the University of Alberta. \nRetained Authority \nGeneral Faculties Council shall pursue major policy and strategic issues that include: \n● significant strategic and policy issues related to the academic affairs of the university;\n● any matter involving the alteration of the mandate, terms of reference, membership, or\nstructure of a GFC standing committee; and\n● those matters that a standing committee, body, or officer holding delegated authority\nfrom GFC considers to be of major strategic significance or long-term impact on the\nuniversity.\nPrinciples \n1. Delegations of authority must be reasonable in scope and appropriate to the character and\ncapacity of the body (e.g. council or committee) or officer receiving the delegated authority. \n2. An officer or body acting with delegated authority is accountable to the body which\ndelegated the authority and must report to that body in a timely and sufficiently detailed\nfashion on actions taken under the delegated authority.\n3. An officer or body is responsible to be alert to situations where, for example, there is\nuncertainty as to whether an item falls within the intended delegation or the significance of\nan issue and the division of opinion on the issue suggest it is prudent to refer the issue or\ndecision to the delegating body for consideration. When there is uncertainty as to whether\nan item falls within the intended delegated authority, or if there is clear division of opinion,\nthe officer or body with delegated authority will refer the item to the body that delegated the\nauthority along with a recommendation.\n4. Delegations should be recorded in written form and curated in a transparent manner.\nAttachment 1a\n2 of 2 \nGENERAL FACULTIES COUNCIL \nPrinciples of Delegation \n 5. A body delegating authority may impose restrictions on that authority -- including restrictions \non the authority to sub-delegate -- so long as the restrictions allow sufficient authority for the \ndelegation to be meaningful. \n6. All delegations of authority should be reviewed at regular intervals (ideally once every three \nyears) to ensure they remain appropriate. \n7. Withdrawal of delegated authority should be considered judiciously based on the best \ninterest of the institution and cannot be done retroactively. \n8. An officer or body is not compelled to exercise delegations. The fact that a delegation is held \ndoes not oblige the officer or body to exercise the delegation if, in the opinion of the \ndelegate, some special or unusual circumstances are involved which make it sensible that \nthe issue should receive consideration at a more senior level. \nApproved by General Faculties Council: <insert date> \n1 of 1 \nGENERAL FACULTIES COUNCIL \nPrinciples of Committee Composition \nPrinciples for General Faculties Council Standing Committee Composition \nIntroduction \nGovernance at the University of Alberta relies upon a structure wherein the General Faculties \nCouncil has delegated many of its provincially-mandated authorities to its standing committees.  \nAs such, the composition of those standing committees is crucial to ensuring that decisions are \nmade in an informed manner that takes into account the breadth of issues, perspectives and \nopinions on campus.  The following principles provide a framework to create committee \ncompositions which are reflective of the membership of GFC and appropriate to the role and \nmandate of those committees.  \nPrinciples \n1. Wherever possible, the majority of elected members of each standing committee should be\ndrawn from the membership of GFC to provide tangible links between GFC and its standing\ncommittees and increase engagement of the greater GFC community.\n2. Wherever possible, the number of elected members of a standing committee should exceed\nthe number of ex-officio members.\n3. The voting status of ex-officio members of standing committees should be consistent with\ntheir voting status on GFC and should extend to their delegates.\n4. Ex-officio members should be included in the membership of a standing committee only\nwhen their portfolio is directly relevant to the mandate and role of the standing committee.\n5. Wherever possible, the Vice-Chair of a standing committee should be elected by the\ncommittee from its elected academic staff members and ideally be a member of GFC.\n6. Standing Committees should be populated with a commitment to diversity and broad\nrepresentation from across the university.\n7. When cross-appointment of members on standing committees is appropriate, this should be\noutlined in the terms of reference of each committee and such members shall have voting\nstatus on both committees.\nApproved by General Faculties Council: <insert date> \nAttachment 1b\n1 of 2 \nGENERAL FACULTIES COUNCIL \nRoles and Responsibilities of Members \nRoles and Responsibilities of Members \nIntroduction \nGeneral Faculties Council (GFC) is the principal academic decision-making body of the \nuniversity. It is established in the Post-Secondary Learning Act (PSLA) and given authority, \nsubject to the Board of Governors, over the academic affairs of the university. \nFor GFC to be successful in fulfilling its terms of reference and meeting its responsibilities to the \nuniversity it depends on the active engagement of its members. GFC has delegated much of its \nauthority for routine matters to standing committees allowing GFC to engage in high level \nstrategic and stewardship policy issues. GFC members have the opportunity to serve on the \nstanding committees that approve matters with the delegated authority from GFC.  \nGFC operates under the principle of collegial academic governance including: \n• A commitment to inclusive and participatory governance decision-making\n• A desire to facilitate meaningful individual-level engagement in governance processes\n• A commitment to openness, transparency, and respectful communication\n• A commitment to responsiveness, respect, and reciprocity between governing bodies\nand between governing bodies and university administration\nRoles and Responsibilities of Members \n1. Understand GFC\n1.1 Members should understand that not all matters under GFC jurisdiction will come\nbefore that body for approval. Some decisions are made at the standing committee \nlevel as GFC has delegated authority to approve and report on actions taken on certain \nmatters.   \n1.2 The university operates in a bicameral governance system. Members should \nunderstand the distinction between the role and responsibilities of GFC and the Board \nof Governors. \n2. Meeting Attendance\n2.1 Members have a responsibility to attend GFC meetings.\na. If a student misses two consecutive meetings, or more than three meetings in one\nacademic year, the Students’ Union or the Graduate Students’ Association may\nrequest that the Chair declare the position vacant.\nb. If a Faculty representative or a non-student member misses two consecutive\nmeetings or more than three meetings in one academic year without a reason\nsatisfactory to the members of the GFC Executive Committee, the Executive\nCommittee shall declare the position vacant.\n2.2 Members have a responsibility to serve on GFC committees as appropriate and attend \ncommittee meetings. \na. If an elected member is absent from three consecutive meetings or is frequently\nabsent without a reason satisfactory to the remaining members of the committee, the \nChair shall declare the position vacant. \nAttachment 1c\n2 of 2 \nGENERAL FACULTIES COUNCIL \nRoles and Responsibilities of Members \n2.3 Members should advise the GFC Secretary or committee coordinator if they are unable \nto attend a meeting. \n3.

GFC rules are not meant to \nunduly restrict debate or limit opportunities for participation. Their purpose is to facilitate \ninclusive and respectful dialogue, while ensuring efficient decision-making. It is the responsibility \nof the Chair, with the support of GFC, to employ the rules governing general meetings in a \nmanner consistent with these principles. Substantive motions should be handled with \nconsiderable formality, but whenever possible the Chair should deal with matters of procedure \nby general agreement. \nThe following rules and procedures are based on a number of fundamental principles that \nencourage participation and engagement of members. These principles include: \n• A commitment to inclusive and participatory decision-making.\n• A commitment to openness, transparency and respectful communication.\n1. Procedural Rules\n1.1  GFC and its standing committees are governed by the procedural rules set out below.\nFor matters not covered by these rules, or by the Post Secondary Learning Act (PSLA) \nreference shall be made to the current edition of Robert's Rules of Order. If this does \nnot provide clear direction regarding a point in question, then the Chair shall decide \nhow to proceed. However, such rulings by the Chair may be overruled via a motion \nsupported by a vote of the majority of those present.  \n1.2  The chairs of GFC and its standing committees will be responsible for guiding \nmeetings of GFC and its standing committees, enforcing rules, and deciding questions \npertaining to those rules. Any decisions of the chair are subject to challenge (see \n10.3). \n1.3 The Chair will not participate actively in debate regarding a motion before GFC without \npassing the role of the Chair to the Vice-Chair for the duration of the debate and the \nsubsequent vote.  \n2. Meetings\n2.1 GFC and its standing committees shall meet regularly during the academic year, the\nschedule of which will be published on the governance website at least one month \nbefore the beginning of each academic year. GFC meetings will not be scheduled \nduring the period set aside for final examinations or Reading Week, however \ncommittee meetings may occur during this time. \n2.2 Cancellation - GFC Executive Committee may cancel a meeting of GFC if it \ndetermines that the number and nature of the agenda items make it reasonable to \ndefer consideration, and provided that notice of such cancellation is given to members \nat least one week prior to the date of the meeting. The Chair of a GFC standing \ncommittee may cancel a meeting if the agenda items make it reasonable to defer \nAttachment 1d\n2 of 6 \nGENERAL FACULTIES COUNCIL \nMeeting Procedural Rules   \n consideration, and provided that notice of such cancellation is given to members as \nearly as possible.  \n 2.3  From time to time, the Chair of GFC may call special meetings of GFC, provided that \nnotice of such meetings is given to members at least one month in advance.  \n 2.4 GFC meetings shall normally be scheduled and planned to end two hours after being \ncalled to order. \n 2.5 Debate on new items of business will not be entertained after GFC has been sitting for \nthree hours.  \n 2.6 No audio or video recording of meetings shall be permitted unless by express authority \nof the Chair. \n3. Open Sessions \n 3.1 Meetings of GFC and its standing committees are normally held in open session, with \nthe exception of those dealing with nominations and adjudication which are always \nheld in closed session. \n 3.2 Subject to the limitations of space and orderly conduct as determined by the chair, \nmembers of the university community and the general public may attend open \nmeetings as observers. Observers may only speak if expressly invited to do so by the \nChair.  \n4. Closed Sessions \n 4.1 From time to time, GFC or its committees may hold meetings or portions of meetings \nas closed meetings; at that point, proceedings will be confidential and all non-\nmembers, except those specifically invited, will be asked to withdraw. \n5.  Questions  \n5.1  If more information than is provided as part of the meeting agenda is required, \ninformation requests may be made of the University Governance office. \n5.2  Questions on an issue within GFC’s jurisdiction may be submitted in writing to the GFC \nSecretary up to six working days before the next GFC meeting to receive a written \nresponse. \n5.3  Every GFC meeting has Question Period as a standing item wherein members may \nraise a question during the time set aside for this item (see 6.5). Procedures for \nQuestion Period are available at governance.ualberta.ca \n5.4  Questions with regard to a specific item on an agenda may be raised during \nconsideration of that item at the GFC meeting. \n6.  Agendas \n 6.1  The agenda of each GFC meeting will be proposed by the GFC Executive Committee \nand approved by GFC. The GFC Executive Committee will ensure that items put \nbefore GFC are complete and ready for discussion and published in advance of the \nmeeting.  \nhttp://www.governance.ualberta.ca/GeneralFacultiesCouncil/%7E/media/Governance/Documents/GO05/GEN/Linked%20Documents%20on%20GFC%20Home%20Page/Question-Period-Excerpt-from-the-2006-GFC-PM.pdf\n3 of 6 \nGENERAL FACULTIES COUNCIL \nMeeting Procedural Rules   \n  6.2 If GFC members want to have an issue debated, they are asked to submit the issue to \nthe GFC Executive Committee. Whenever possible, members wishing to add items to \nthe agenda should contact the Chair or GFC Secretary two weeks in advance of the \nGFC Executive Committee meeting to allow time for the item to be added to the \nagenda. \n 6.3 Should a member wish to add an item to the agenda at a meeting of GFC, a two-thirds \nvote of those present is required; the Chair will then determine where the item appears \non the agenda. In cases where the Chair or GFC Secretary has been informed in \nadvance of a planned request to add a new item, but after the agenda has been \npublished, the proposal shall be circulated to members through the normal means. \n 6.4 When the Agenda is being approved, the Chair will entertain a request to change the \norder of items, for specified reasons.  \n 6.5 Each agenda of GFC and its standing committees will include Question Period of one \nhalf hour in length that may be extended with the approval of members.  \na. Question period is comprised of both written questions and, time permitting, \nquestions from the floor.   \nb. The Chair will rule on whether a question from the floor can be answered \nexpeditiously; if not, it will be referred to the appropriate officer for response at the \nnext meeting.  \n 6.6 Reports from standing committees are included on the GFC agenda for information \nonly. Questions may be asked for clarification, but no debate may take place on such \nitems. \n 6.7 Reports for Information may be moved to the discussion part of the agenda if a \nmember gives two days notice to the GFC Secretary to ensure that an appropriate \nperson is present to answer questions that may arise during discussion.  \n 6.8   Agendas and materials for open session meetings are posted at \ngovernance.ualberta.ca \n7. Quorum  \n 7.1 General Faculties Council -  The quorum for a GFC meeting is one-third of the total \nmembership, except in the months of May through August when the quorum shall be \none-quarter of the total membership.  \n 7.2 GFC Standing Committees – The quorum for standing committee meetings is one-half \nof the voting members or, in the case where this is an even number, one-half plus 1 \nmember.  \n 7.3 Vacancies on committees are not included when establishing quorum. \n 7.4 Maintaining quorum - A duly-called meeting which starts with a quorum present shall \nbe deemed to have a continuing quorum, notwithstanding the departure of voting \nmembers, unless the quorum is challenged by a voting member. In the event of a \nchallenge, the remaining members may choose to adjourn or continue the meeting. In \nhttp://www.governance.ualberta.ca/en/GeneralFacultiesCouncil.aspx\n4 of 6 \nGENERAL FACULTIES COUNCIL \nMeeting Procedural Rules   \n the event of a decision to continue a meeting without quorum, the minutes shall record \nthis fact and any decisions taken must be ratified at the next meeting.  \n8. Motions \n 8.1 Normally, all motions concerning substantive matters shall be published in the agenda \nmaterials. \n 8.2 All motions must be moved and seconded by members of GFC.  Motions to appoint \nnew members may only be moved and seconded by statutory members of GFC. \n 8.3 Motions pass with a majority vote, except for the following: (1) motions to add an item \nto the agenda require a two-thirds majority of those present; (2) motions to rescind a \nmotion require a two-thirds majority of total members. \n 8.4 To make a motion, a member must be recognized by the Chair. (In the interest of \nclarity and to expedite business, it is advisable to provide a written motion to the GFC \nSecretary). The person making a motion will be invited by the Chair to speak first in \nany ensuing debate. \n 8.5 Amendments to Motions - A member may make a motion to amend the wording – \nand within certain limits the meaning – of a pending motion before the pending motion \nitself is voted upon. The amendment must be germane and cannot be used to \nintroduce a new subject. An amendment is debatable. \n 8.6 Motion to Adjourn - A motion to adjourn is a motion to close the meeting. It must be \nseconded, is not debatable or amendable, and typically requires a simple majority \nvote. During the months of March and April, motions to adjourn require a two-thirds \nmajority if substantive items of business remain on the agenda.  \n 8.7 During the course of a GFC meeting, members may make a Notice of Motion for \ndebate at the next GFC meeting. In such cases GFC Executive will be responsible for \nplacement of the motion on the next GFC agenda. \n9. Motions for Specific Purposes \n 9.1 Motion to Table – Enables the pending question to be laid aside until some future \ntime. The motion cannot be debated. The mover may make a statement regarding \nwhat information they believe would be required to remove the item from the table, and \nthe proposer of the item may make a brief comment on the impact of tabling the \nmotion.  \n 9.2 Motion to Take From the Table – Brings the motion back before GFC and cannot be \ndebated. \n. \n 9.3 Motion to Reconsider an item which was voted upon at the current or the last \nmeeting. If passed, proceedings are restored to the point immediately prior to the vote \nto which it applies. \n 9.4 Motion to Rescind a Motion is only used when a Motion to Reconsider is out of time. \nMotions to Rescind require support of two-thirds of the total membership if no Notice of \nMotion was given, but only a simple majority if Notice was given.  \n5 of 6 \nGENERAL FACULTIES COUNCIL \nMeeting Procedural Rules   \n 10. Debate \n 10.1  Normally, a member may not speak for a second time until the Chair is satisfied that all \nmembers wishing to speak for their first time have done so. \n 10.2  A member who has the floor may not normally be interrupted. However, the Chair may \ninterrupt a speaker if the speaker is out of order by using unacceptable language, is \nabusive of other members, or is not speaking to the motion. If the Chair does not do \nso, a member may raise this as a point of order.  \n 10.3  Point of Order - It is the right of any member who notices a breach of the rules of \nCouncil to insist on their enforcement. If the Chair fails to notice such a breach, any \nmember may make the appropriate Point of Order, calling on the Chair for a ruling. A \nPoint of Order does not require a seconder, it is not debatable or amendable, and \ncannot be reconsidered.  \n 10.4  Calling the Question - Upon hearing a member call the question, the Chair will ask \nmembers if they are ready to vote on the motion being discussed. If there appears to \nbe opposition to closing the debate, the Chair may ask for a motion to close debate. If \nseconded, members will then vote on this motion and proceed accordingly.  \n11. Debates without Motions \n11.1  When discussion of an issue and the formal rules pertaining to making motions, \ndebate, and voting seem to be a hindrance to thoughtful discussion, the GFC agenda \ncan allow for a less structured discussion guided by the Chair and the consensus of \nthe members in attendance.  \n12. Attendance  \n 12.1 Delegates – members who serve on GFC or its standing committees by virtue of their \noffice may send a delegate; such delegates shall act with all the rights of membership.  \nThere shall be no alternates for other members. \n 12.2 GFC attendance - If a student misses two consecutive meetings or more than three \nmeetings, the Students’ Union or the Graduate Students’ Association may request that \nthe Chair declare the position vacant. If a faculty representative or a non-student \nappointed member misses two consecutive meetings or more than three meetings in \none academic year without a reason satisfactory to the members of the GFC Executive \nCommittee, the Executive Committee may declare the position vacant.  \n 12.3 Standing committee attendance - If an elected member is absent from three \nconsecutive meetings or is frequently absent without a reason satisfactory to the \nremaining members of the Committee, the Chair shall declare the position vacant.  \n13. Voting  \n 13.1 All members of GFC are charged with the responsibility of examining issues before \nCouncil and voting as they judge fit on such issues. No member of GFC, regardless of \nhow that person gains membership on Council, is an instructed delegate. \n 13.2 Motions shall normally be adopted on a simple majority of members present except to \nadd items to the agenda which requires a two-thirds majority of those present, or for a \nMotion to Rescind which requires a two-thirds majority vote of total membership. \n6 of 6 \nGENERAL FACULTIES COUNCIL \nMeeting Procedural Rules   \n  13.3  An abstention is not considered to be a vote cast.  \n 13.4 The Chair votes only in the instance of a tie. When there is a tie vote, the motion is lost \nif the Chair abstains.  \n 13.5 All members may participate in discussions; only voting members may move, second \nand vote on motions.  \n 13.6 Electronic Votes by Committees – In cases where extensive deliberation is not \nessential to determining a course of action and it is necessary for a business item to \nbe decided before the next scheduled meeting, the Chair and Secretary of a GFC \nstanding committee may hold an electronic vote. The motion will be duly moved and \nseconded and all normal procedures will be followed in conducting the e-mail ballot. \nHowever, upon receiving the item of business and ballot, any committee member may \nrequest that the matter be debated at the next meeting or at a special meeting and the \nvote delayed until after that debate, with the Chair determining the appropriate course \nof action.  \n 13.7 Electronic Votes by GFC – In cases where GFC is the electing body to populate \ncertain selection committees and other bodies, the election process may use e-vote \nmechanisms. \n 13.8 Electronic Approval of Committee Reports by GFC – Reports from the Nominating and \nReplenishment Committees may be distributed electronically to GFC members and are \nconsidered approved by the deadlines indicated on the report subject to receipt of \nadditional nominations.   \n14.

GFC April 21, 2017\n4 \nINTRODUCTION \nThe Alberta Post-Secondary Learning Act (PSLA) assigns to General Faculties Council (GFC) responsibility \nfor the “academic affairs” of the university. The fulfillment of this responsibility is essential to realizing \nthe University of Alberta’s core mission. Together, GFC’s 158 members – including elected faculty and \nstudents, administrative leaders, and representatives of other constituencies – form one of two \ngoverning bodies that comprise the university’s bicameral system of governance. The other governing \nbody is the Board of Governors, which has primary responsibility for the business affairs of the \ninstitution. The proper functioning of the Board and GFC are essential to the university’s institutional \nautonomy and the processes of collegial academic governance.  \nThe ad hoc committee on Academic Governance including Delegated Authority was established by \nGeneral Faculties Council on September 26, 2016 and was tasked with reviewing academic governance \nat the institutional level, with a focus on the operations of GFC and its standing committees (including \nthe delegation of authority from GFC to its committees, the mandate and structure of those committees, \nand related matters).  \nThe establishment of the ad hoc committee \narose out of concerns regarding the extent to \nwhich GFC was engaged in and exercising its \nauthority over matters of academic importance, \nand questions around how decisions were made. \nBoth the effectiveness and the usefulness of \nGFC as a governance body were being \nquestioned.  \nThe ad hoc committee began its work by \nestablishing principles to guide its deliberations; \nthese were brought to GFC and endorsed on \nNovember 21, 2016. The committee then \nidentified the core problems that should be \naddressed by its recommendations: \n• Lack of engagement on substantive issues\n• Lack of transparency and easy access to information\n• Limited clarity regarding the role and powers of GFC and its committees\n• The general sense that GFC has felt disempowered\n• Limited opportunities for committee participation\nWith these concerns in mind, the committee concluded that the task of reforming academic governance \nrequired clear principles and guidelines regarding the responsibilities of GFC members, the delegation of \npowers, the composition of GFC committees, and the procedural rules for meetings of GFC and its \ncommittees. Four documents were developed, for immediate approval by GFC. These documents are \nintended to guide the implementation of the committee’s recommendations, including revisions to \nstanding committees and terms of reference, and also serve as a basis for future efforts to evaluate and \nimprove academic governance at the University of Alberta. The four documents to be presented for \napproval address the following matters:  \nGuiding Principles \nCommitment to the principles of ‘collegial academic \ngovernance’:  \n• A desire to build mutual understanding of\ncommon goals and shared purpose – \noperationalized in numerous ways, including \nthe adoption of an institutional strategic plan. \n• A commitment to inclusive and participatory\ngovernance decision-making. \n• A desire to facilitate meaningful individual-level\nengagement in governance processes. \n• A commitment to openness, transparency, and\nrespectful communication. \n• A commitment to responsiveness, respect, and\nreciprocity between governing bodies and \nbetween governing bodies and university \nadministration.  \nv. GFC April 21, 2017\n5 \n• Principles for Delegation of Authority\n• Principles for Standing Committee Composition\n• Roles and Responsibilities of Members\n• Meeting Procedural Rules for GFC and its standing committees\nThe ad hoc committee also noted during its work that the effectiveness of GFC is dependent upon \nstructure, culture, and people. This report speaks to the structure of GFC, including standing committees \nand delegated authority; and it speaks to the culture of GFC, including shared commitments to collegial \ngovernance, transparency and respectful communication. But, when addressing the culture of collegial \ngovernance, the committee was clear that the vitality of GFC depends on an active commitment on the \npart of the university’s administrative leaders. The final piece – people – is dependent on the broader \nuniversity community and those who choose to participate. The structures can create opportunities for \nthose who are engaged, but it is up to each individual to participate in the processes of collegial \ngovernance and thus contribute to the important academic mission of the university. \nBACKGROUND \nGeneral Faculties Council derives its legislative authority from the PSLA; Sections 26, 31 and 32 outline \nthe powers of GFC in a detailed fashion but the \npowers can be summed by the statement that, \n“Subject to the authority of the board, a general \nfaculties council is responsible for the academic \naffairs of the university…” Section 26(3) stipulates \nthat GFC may delegate any of its powers, duties and \nfunctions under the PSLA as it sees fit.  On this basis, \nGFC established its structure of standing committees \nand delegated various authorities to these \ncommittees. \nHISTORICAL CONTEXT \nThe University Act of 1942 granted General Faculties Council authority over academic matters. At that \ntime, this academic governance body was comprised of Deans and the President and considered a wide \nbreadth of matters. By the early 1960s, membership of GFC had expanded and now included the Vice-\nPresident, professors, associate professors and assistant professors.  By 1966, a standing committee \nstructure was established and GFC began delegating its authority to these committees. \nOver the next fifty years, the university grew in size and complexity and GFC, in response, continued the \nprocess of delegating authority to standing committees, Faculty Councils, and senior administrators. \nThrough delegation, some matters could be approved at the committee level and thus allow GFC the \ntime to operate as a deliberative body focused on larger issues.   \nOne of the basic principles of good governance is for a governing body to engage in regular reviews of its \nstructures and operations to ensure it is fulfilling its mission and meeting its needs and goals, and does \nso in a manner that responds to current contexts. Since the current standing committees were \nCurrent GFC Standing Committees \nExecutive Committee / Nominating Committee \nAcademic Planning Committee \nAcademic Standards Committee \nFacilities Development Committee \nCommittee on the Learning Environment \nCampus Law Review Committee \nUndergraduate Awards and Scholarship Committee \nUniversity Teaching Awards Committee \nReplenishment Committee \nv. GFC April 21, 2017\n6 \nestablished in 1966 and the delegations of authority began, GFC has struck many ad hoc committees \nand received numerous reports looking to make changes.  \nA review of current terms of reference provides ample evidence of this historic legacy illustrated by the \nmany revisions made over the years. Indeed, the accumulated complexity of existing committee terms \nof reference suggests the time has come for a systematic and coordinated review of the current \ncommittee structure and an evaluation of the delegations of authority which have accumulated in \ncommittee terms of reference over the last fifty years. \nPast GFC Reviews: \nBetween 1974 and 2004, GFC engaged in a number of internal reviews.  Some were initiated as part of a \nrenewal process, while others were spurred by the changing post-secondary landscape, including \nfinancial constraints.  The majority of these were structured to look at specific concerns. \nMore recently, three discrete initiatives resulted in documents addressing issues of academic \ngovernance: \n• 2013 – Academic Governance: Moving Forward – White Paper on General Faculties Council \nReforms  \n• 2014 – Students’ Union Discussion Paper on General Faculties Council  \n• 2014 – Report of Task Force on GFC Reforms  \nIn addition, in response to calls for increased discussion at GFC meetings, in January/February 2015 the \nGFC Executive Committee developed guidelines for discussion topics for GFC. \nA number of themes are identified in these documents including: the lack of substantive discussion at \nGFC; questions regarding delegation of authority; committee structure, including role, size, number, \nmembership, overlap, gaps (IT, research), and information flow between committees; the slow pace \nwith which proposals go through governance pathways; and online records, particularly archives. \nIn 2015/16 the GFC Executive Committee established an Academic Governance Working Group (AGWG) \nto review these items and report back. Over the course of the year, the AGWG implemented changes \naimed at increasing engagement and educating the community on availability of documents. At the end \nof the year, the AGWG recommended a new ad hoc committee be established with a formal mandate to \naddress the issues further.  \nAD HOC COMMITTEE \nThe ad hoc committee began meeting in October of 2016 and met frequently over the next six months \nto develop the recommendations presented here. Some of the committee’s initial observations include: \n• Changes that have occurred at GFC since 2015 have served to increase the number of broad \ndiscussion items and strategic priorities coming forward \n• Several changes related to enhancing engagement that were suggested by the AGWG have \nalready been implemented  \n• The evolving culture of GFC and experiments with innovations such as a joint meeting involving \nGFC, the Board, Senate and Alumni Association were already having some positive impact on the \noperations of GFC \n• Some of the concerns raised regarding transparency are, in part, a matter of perception and can \nbe addressed by further education \nv. GFC April 21, 2017\n7 \n• There is a pressing need for some broad foundational work regarding core principles that would \nguide GFC reforms, including to committee structures and delegations of authority \n• A comprehensive look at GFC and its standing committees was, indeed, overdue  \nThe ad hoc committee thus proceeded with a process of research and consultation that included review \nof the committee structures at other Canadian universities and consultation with each of the standing \ncommittees and other stakeholders. \nThis process has informed the foundational work that, in turn, informs a set of principles, guidelines, and \nprocedural rules that are being put before GFC for approval, and a set of recommendations that, if \nendorsed, will guide ongoing reform initiatives to be approved, in stages, by GFC committees and GFC \nitself.  \nThere are four core elements to the ad hoc committee’s recommendations and calls for action by GFC. \nThese are outlined in more detail later in this report, and its appendices: \n1. Approval of four documents outlining core guidelines, principles and procedures  \n2. Approval in principle of new draft Standing Committee Terms of Reference. These draft terms of \nreference reflect the guiding documents but, in the spirit of collegiality, will need to go to the \nstanding committees for refinement before coming back to GFC for final approval \n3. Endorsement of a series of recommendations that can be refined and implemented under the \ndirection of GFC Executive with the necessary approval of GFC. As the reporting deadline \napproached, the ad hoc committee recognized that there were some areas that were going to \nrequire further work and consultation before a firm plan could come forward for approval. \nRecommendations are offered on these items, some of which are more fully developed than \nothers. It is anticipated that GFC Executive Committee will provide the oversight for GFC to \nensure that these items continue to develop and return to GFC on or before April 2019. \n4. Finally, there are other outstanding issues that have been identified by the ad hoc committee \nthat are brought to the attention of GFC for further consideration and future action. \nThe ad hoc committee recognizes that GFC exists in an ever-changing world and it is not possible to \nidentify all of the new challenges and opportunities that will come forward in the next decades. \nTherefore, and in accordance with good governance principles, the terms of reference and delegations \nshould be considered as living documents and subject to regular review. It is written into the delegations \nthat they should be reviewed least every three years. It is anticipated that the terms would be looked at \nmore frequently. \nRECOMMENDATIONS \nThe ad hoc committee has provided a series of recommendations that will require various timelines for \nfinal approval and implementation; this process should be continued under the direction of the GFC \nExecutive Committee on behalf of GFC with proposals coming forward for approval as they are fully \ndeveloped. The work of implementing recommendations will begin in the fall of 2017 and should be \ncompleted on or before April 2019. \nThe recommendations below are organized under a number of titles; however, it is important to \nremember that few of these recommendations stand alone. The components of GFC and academic \nv. GFC April 21, 2017\n8 \ngovernance are complex and inter-related and should be viewed as an entire system with pieces in one \nsection speaking to other sections. \nThe recommendations are organized under the following headings: \n• General Faculties Council \n• Delegated Authority \n• Committee Composition \n• Free-standing Nomination Committee / Disbanding of Replenishment Committee \n• Research Governance and the Academic Planning Committee \n• Program Approval and Regulations \n• GFC / Board of Governors Relations \n• Orientation and Education \n• Task Oriented Committees \n• Areas and committees requiring further work and consultation \nGENERAL FACULTIES COUNCIL \nMany of the recommendations in this report will have an impact on GFC members’ understanding of \nacademic governance and their level of engagement in General Faculties Council and its committees. \nThere are, for example, recommendations to increase the number of GFC members on standing \ncommittees, improve orientation processes and clarify the responsibilities of GFC members, and provide \nclear principles to guide delegations of authority from GFC to its committees.  \nTwo of the ad hoc committee’s recommendations aim to improve opportunities for early and \nmeaningful debate on important issues. The committee is aware that GFC members have been \nconcerned about the lack of opportunity for fulsome debate on significant and strategic matters. Some \nmembers have complained that GFC seemed to be ‘rubber stamping’ proposals rather than shaping \ntheir content. In order to ensure GFC has opportunities to contribute to the content of significant \nproposals and shape the direction of policy, it is recommended that matters of significant academic \nimportance or interest be brought to GFC for early consultation before proceeding through the regular \napproval pathway.  \nRecommendation: THAT opportunities be created to allow agenda items that are in the development \nstage to come before GFC for early consultation and discussion, and that this shall include items that \nwill be considered for approval by standing committees as well as items that will eventually be \ndecided upon by GFC. \nA reinvigorated GFC that is making important contributions to policies and initiatives that are critical to \nthe academic mission of the university will require additional meetings and more time for discussion and \ndebate.  \nRecommendation: THAT GFC schedule eight meetings per year between September and June. \nDELEGATED AUTHORITY \nGeneral Faculties Council delegates some of its provincially-mandated authorities to its standing \ncommittees, individuals and other campus bodies. Delegation is essential to efficient and timely \nv. GFC April 21, 2017\n9 \ndecision-making and allows GFC to focus on substantive and strategic issues of broad relevance to the \nuniversity community. The ad hoc committee’s specific recommendations relating to delegated \nauthority are as follows: \nRecommendation: THAT substantive and strategic issues of broad relevance to the university \ncommunity should be brought to GFC for early consultation regardless of whether authority for those \nissues has been delegated to another body or individual \nRecommendation: THAT the GFC Executive Committee be responsible for ensuring that all delegations \nof authority are reviewed at a minimum once every three years \nRecommendation: THAT delegations of authority to GFC standing committees and any sub-\ndelegations be clearly articulated in the terms of reference of each affected standing committee \nRecommendation: THAT a comprehensive record of all delegations and sub-delegations of GFC \nauthority be compiled and curated by the GFC Secretary \nRecommendation: THAT when individuals, standing committees and other bodies are uncertain as to \nwhether an item falls within the intended delegation or whether the significance of an issue and the \ndivision of opinion on the issue suggest that it is an issue that should be considered by the full GFC, \nthat individual, committee or body should err on the side of caution and refer the matter to full GFC \nThese recommendations are contained in the Principles of Delegation that should be used to inform the \nregular review of delegations and to consider proposals to create, remove or change delegations. \nCOMMITTEE COMPOSITION \nThe standing committees of GFC should be organized to reflect the composition of GFC including ex-\nofficio, elected and appointed members. In some cases, the membership has been expanded to include \nmembers from outside of GFC who bring specific expertise or perspectives that allow committees to \nmake the best decisions for the university.  \nWhen considering committee composition, the ad hoc committee discussed how to decide who would \nbe eligible to be voting members of the committees, and the balance between ex-officio, appointed and \nelected members, among other issues. The ad hoc committee is of the opinion that to accomplish the \nwork delegated to them, and to increase the engagement of GFC members in the business of \ncommittees, it is important that a significant number of members of GFC committees be GFC members. \nThe ad hoc committee also concluded that it is useful to require, whenever possible, that each \ncommittee elect a faculty member who is a member of GFC to serve as the Committee Vice-Chair. These \ninitiatives will help strengthen the link between GFC and its committees.  \nThe ad hoc committee also discussed the importance of deepening the engagement of student \nmembers of GFC. Committee members believe that having student members of GFC populate student \npositions on GFC committees will provide insights into the work conducted by GFC’s committees, and \nprovide students with productive opportunities to work on issues with greater depth. \nWith regard to the voting rights of GFC committee members, the ad hoc committee has accepted the \nOmbuds Office’s request that it be viewed as a service unit and hold only non-voting positions on \ncommittees where it has representation. Of more broad significance, the ad hoc committee \nv. GFC April 21, 2017\n10 \nrecommends that the voting status of ex-officio members of standing committees be determined by \ntheir voting status on GFC – ex-officio members of committees who currently sit as voting members of \nGFC will also be voting members of any committees they are on; those who do not vote at GFC will be \nrestricted from voting on GFC committees. \nWhen considering relationships between committees, the ad hoc committee considered where formal \ncross-appointments between committees would be useful. In cases where it was decided that cross-\nappointments are productive – including between GFC Executive and APC, between APC and ASC, and \nbetween APC and FDC – it is recommended that these members have voting status at both committees. \nPrinciples of Committee Composition were developed to guide decisions regarding the composition of \ncommittees. These are fleshed out in the Principles of Committee Composition document, but include \nthe principles recommended here:  \nRecommendation: THAT elected positions on GFC standing committees be filled, as much as possible, \nby members of GFC \nRecommendation: THAT each committee should elect an academic staff member who, whenever \npossible, is a member of GFC, as Vice-Chair \nRecommendation: THAT ex-officio members on standing committees vote in accordance with their \nvoting status on GFC  \nFREE-STANDING NOMINATING COMMITTEE / DISBANDING OF REPLENISHMENT COMMITTEE \nCurrently the Nominating Committee is a sub-committee of the Executive Committee. Its members \ninclude the elected members and ex-officio student members of the Executive Committee and a non-\nacademic staff member of GFC. While this structure has been effective in the past, members of the \nNominating Committee believe their effectiveness as a committee is constrained by the fact that its role \nin managing the nomination process is an additional duty rather than their primary focus. Some GFC \nmembers have also noted that having the Executive Committee be responsible for nominations \ncontributes to perceptions of concentration of authority and lack of transparency.  \nThe ad hoc committee is recommending the establishment of a free-standing Nominating Committee \ncharged with responsibility for encouraging, identifying, and securing a diverse group of individuals who \nare prepared to be active and engaged members of GFC committees. Once the new Nominating \nCommittee is established, the existing Replenishment Committee – which currently replenishes the \nNominating Committee – could be disbanded. \nA move in this direction will need to be implemented in stages to ensure time to transition from the old \nto the new committee structure, and to review and revise processes and timelines for replenishment \nand nomination.  \nRecommendation: THAT a free-standing Nominating Committee be established  \nRecommendation: THAT the Replenishment Committee remain in place in the interim and be \ndisbanded when no longer needed  \nv. GFC April 21, 2017\n11 \nRESEARCH GOVERNANCE AND THE ACADEMIC PLANNING COMMITTEE \nGFC is responsible for the academic affairs of the university, which should be understood to include \nsetting and overseeing policies that have broad consequences for the facilitation, conduct, and \nmanagement of research. In practice, some aspects of decision-making authority regarding research-\nrelated issues are delegated to executive and administrative decision makers, including to researchers \nthemselves. This is consistent with good governance, effective administration, and academic freedom. \nHowever, consistent with the principles of collegial academic governance, GFC maintains authority over \ncore, framework-defining research policies. The question the ad hoc committee considered was where, \nwithin the GFC committee structure, responsibility for research policy should be delegated. \nConsideration of this question is motivated, in part, by a desire to ensure sufficient attention and \npriority is dedicated to an area of policy that is central to the university’s success and stature as a major \nresearch-intensive university.  \nBackground \nGFC has not had a stand-alone research committee since 1976, when the Research Committee was \ndisbanded and its responsibilities were transferred to the Council of the Faculty of Graduate Studies. At \nsome point, however, GFC committees reassumed authority over research policy, but in the context of \ncommittees with broader responsibilities for academic development and planning. Currently, the \nAcademic Planning Committee (APC) has primary responsibility for research. As a senior GFC committee, \nAPC is empowered to consider or recommend to GFC on any academic issue, including “any research-\nrelated issue.” APC is, moreover, specifically empowered to make recommendations concerning policy \nmatters and actions respecting research-related matters such as establishing or terminating endowed \nand funded chairs and academic centres and institutes.  \nDespite the fact that APC has a mandate that extends to the full range of research policies and issues, \nthe 2014 Task Force on GFC Reforms reported that research matters are “seldom addressed in GFC \ncommittees.” Research and research policy do not receive extensive or sustained attention by GFC or \nany of its committees. \nAt present, the committee that deals most directly with research and research policy is the University \nResearch Policy Committee (URPC). URPC is an advisory committee to the Vice-President Research, \nmakes recommendations on research policy and decision-making, and serves as a conduit through \nwhich administrative policies are transmitted to faculty members. It does not make recommendations \ndirectly to GFC or any of its committees – it is a committee of ‘administration’, not ‘governance’. \nMany Canadian universities have standalone research committees as a part of their governance \nstructure. A number of university Senates (Note: outside Alberta the university Senate is equivalent to \nour General Faculties Council) have standing Research Committees, including: UBC, Calgary, \nSaskatchewan, Manitoba, Western, and Queen’s. Some of these committees have broad responsibility \nthat, like the University of Alberta’s APC, includes ‘learning and research’ or ‘academic programs and \nresearch’. But, others have more narrow mandates focused specifically on research. The key \ncommonalities in the terms of reference for these committees include responsibility for advising on \nresearch policy, promoting institutional research, governing centres and institutes, and receiving and \nreviewing reports related to matters such as funding by granting agencies and human and animal ethics. \nThe University of Calgary’s Research and Scholarship Committee is characterized as GFC’s “primary \nadvisory group on research and scholarly initiatives, issues, and activities.” The ad hoc committee \nv. GFC April 21, 2017\n12 \nbelieves it is essential that a research-intensive institution, such as the University of Alberta, have an \nacademic governance committee mandated to consider high-level research issues as a part of its \ngovernance structure.  \nOptions and Recommendations \nThe 2014 Task Force on GFC reforms pointed out that it is not inconsistent with good governance to \ndelegate most or all decision-making authority regarding research-related issues to well-chosen \nexecutives such as the Vice-President (Research) and administrative decision-making bodies like URPC. \nBut, such delegation limits GFC’s active responsibility for an area of policy that is central to academic \naffairs and reduces opportunities for collegial self-governance. Thus, the ad hoc committee was quick to \nreject more explicit administrative delegation and focused, instead, on two options for clarifying and \nfocusing renewed attention on research policy within the structures of GFC. \n1.) Amend APC’s terms of reference to clarify in more detail its delegated authority with regard to \nresearch-related issues: \nThis option would clarify (for GFC and the university community) the place of research policy in \ngovernance, and enhance the extent to which the committee would be more proactive in taking up \nresearch-related issues. It would likely result in research issues being addressed more regularly in the \ncontext of a senior GFC committee, while not negatively impacting the productive role that URPC has \ncome to play as an advisory committee to the Vice-President (Research). It would, however, be \nimportant to ensure that any amendments to APC’s terms of reference did not leave the committee \nover stretched. APC already meets very frequently and has a wide variety of concerns to address.  \n2.) Delegate authority over research-related issues to a new research-focused committee – the GFC \nResearch Committee: \nRather than leave responsibility for research policy and research-related issues with APC, which is \ncurrently the GFC committee with the broadest mandate and responsibilities, GFC could establish a new \ncommittee with new terms of reference focused specifically on research policy and related issues. To \navoid creating a new ‘layer’ of governance decision-making, this committee would have to assume full \nresponsibility for research matters currently delegated to APC, as well as for providing strategic advice \nto GFC on a broad range of research-related issues. The primary benefit of this option would be the \nrenewed focus on research policy and issues; it would create a dedicated space within the structures of \ncollegial governance for proactive research policy initiatives. It would be important, however, for this \ncommittee to avoid duplicating or undermining the value-added advisory role currently played by URPC. \nSome individuals consulted by the ad hoc committee wondered if, given the currently limited volume of \nresearch-related issues on the agendas of existing GFC committees, a new stand-alone GFC Research \nCommittee might find itself without a sufficiently full agenda. This could undermine the goal of \nincreasing the visibility and perceived importance of research to GFC. \nInitially, the ad hoc committee was predisposed to recommend the creation of a new stand-alone GFC \ncommittee with responsibility for research policy and research-related issues. However, when the \ncommittee’s deliberations shifted from the place of research in academic governance to the question of \nthe future of APC, opinions shifted. The committee agreed that APC’s role requires clarification. The \nexisting APC terms of reference identify a long list of responsibilities, but those do not seem to be \norganized around a clear perspective on the meaning of ‘academic planning’. Work on APC’s terms of \nv. GFC April 21, 2017\n13 \nreference identified matters that are more properly the purview of the Executive or Academic Standards \nCommittee, as well as issues that could be addressed by a reinvigorated Committee on the Learning \nEnvironment (CLE) that is empowered to recommend directly to full GFC.  In time, the committee was \nconvinced that its goals related to the profile of research issues and policy could be achieved in concert \nwith clarifying the role and cleaning up the terms of reference for APC. A decision was taken to \nrecommend transforming APC into a new Academic and Research Planning Committee (ARPC).  \nRecommendation: THAT GFC’s Academic Planning Committee be replaced by an Academic and \nResearch Planning Committee (ARPC) \nRecommendation: THAT the new Academic and Research Planning Committee assume the academic \nplanning responsibilities of APC, as well as responsibility for research and research policy, including \nAcademic Centres and Institutes, research ethics, copyright and intellectual property, postdoctoral \nfellows, field research policy, and funded and endowed chairs   \nPROGRAM APPROVAL AND REGULATIONS \nA fundamental role of GFC in academic governance is to set university-wide academic regulations, and \napprove new programs and changes to existing programs. The role of GFC is distinct from the role of the \nOffice of the Provost and Vice-President (Academic) in overseeing the development of new programs \nand changes to existing programs and their alignment with institutional goals and the procedures set \nout by the Ministry of Advanced Education. \nThe approval pathways related to programs and regulations can be convoluted and burdensome for \nthose proposing them. The current standing committee structure does not appear to provide a cohesive \napproach to these activities as portions of proposals can follow different approval pathways; this results \nin the appearance of a confusing, slow and cumbersome pathway for approval of new programs, \nprogram changes and course changes.  \nThe recommendations in this section seek to ensure that the governance oversight expected by GFC is in \nplace and that proposals follow pathways that are clear and add value at each step. Some changes are \nproposed which add value to the proposal and some provide a more transparent and seamless pathway \nto approval. The changes will ensure: approval processes are streamlined yet rigorous; that necessary \nconsultations occur; that there is clarity with regard to which bodies have authority for particular \napprovals; that value is added at each step; and that resources are used efficiently. \nOnce the university’s internal processes have approved proposed programs, proposals must often be \nforwarded to the provincial government and the Campus Alberta Quality Council (CAQC) for approval. \nThis step often adds significant time to the final approval and should be taken into consideration by \nproposers.  \nThe Role of the Academic Standards Committee  \nASC plays an integral role in reviewing and approving matters related to programs, courses, and \nregulations. The recommendations that follow include utilizing the expertise of this committee even \nfurther by expanding its role in reviewing and providing advice on program proposals. \nPast reviews of GFC have called into question the high proportion of ex-officio members on this \ncommittee and the very few elected GFC members. The ad hoc committee also struggled with this issue \nv. GFC April 21, 2017\n14 \nas the principles of committee composition were being drafted with a clear intention of greater GFC \nrepresentation on its committees.   \nThe current composition of ASC includes the Dean of every Faculty. In practice, the Associate Dean sits \nas the Dean’s delegate. These individuals arguably have the most hands-on experience of program \nissues of anyone at the university. The Associate Deans who sit on ASC are all experienced academics \nmany of whom continue to teach during their time as Associate Deans. They are not mere bureaucrats, \nbut academic staff members who have been chosen by their Deans for their willingness to work hard to \nadminister and improve academic programs within their own Faculties. They are necessarily student-\noriented and keep student issues top of mind when reviewing proposed changes. Their Deans rely on \nthem to both represent their Faculty and work in the best interests of the university overall. \nIt is a collegial group that attempts both in meetings and through other informal means to share best \npractices in both program administration and student issues. The individuals who appear before ASC as \nproposers or presenters often come away from an ASC meeting with a fuller understanding of how the \nuniversity operates, and how other units handle the inevitable problems and issues that can arise. \nThe presence of every Faculty (including Extension and FGSR) on ASC ensures there is an inclusive and \nparticipatory process to assist proposers to craft the best proposal possible. The presence of every \nFaculty also ensures that the whole University community becomes aware of the innovation or changes \nthat are taking place in another Faculty and often spurs changes in their own areas. All Faculties benefit \nfrom seeing well-designed proposals.  \nASC is a hard-working and well-functioning committee of knowledgeable and committed members. The \nad hoc committee considered that ASC should be an exception to the committee composition principle \nas the level of expertise brought to this committee, and the value that it added to proposals approved at \nthat level or recommended to APC was essential to the university.  \nRecommendation: THAT the ex-officio membership on ASC remain unchanged; and that the \nmembership be expanded to include two additional elected GFC members and the Associate Dean of \nStudents as a non-voting member \nCourse and minor program changes \nCurrently the process for course and minor program changes is governed by section 37 of the GFC policy \nmanual – this process is commonly referred to as ‘course circulation’. The delegated authority for \napproving course changes and minor program changes rests with Faculty Councils; the limitation on this \nauthority is that the proposed changes are subject to ‘challenge’ by the university community following \ncirculation. This policy also empowers GFC Executive to ratify new course designators and course re-\nnumbering, and to resolve challenges arising from the circulation that cannot be resolved between \nFaculties. This system has been in place since the 1970s. It was meant to reduce the workload of the GFC \nstanding committee that had responsibility for these matters. It is evident, however, that the current \nprocess remains inefficient and requires significant resources. The ad hoc committee proposes that the \nAcademic Standards Committee Subcommittee on Standards be charged with conducting a thorough \nreview of the current policy to develop a process that is transparent, easy to understand, and \nstreamlined.  \nv. GFC April 21, 2017\n15 \nFurthermore, given that ASC includes representation from all Faculties and the Registrar’s Office, and \nthe membership normally includes those involved in reviewing proposals under section 37, the ad hoc \ncommittee believes that ASC would be better placed than the Executive Committee to be responsible \nfor ratifying new course designators and approving course re-numbering proposals. \nRecommendation: THAT, over the next year, the ASC Subcommittee on Standards be charged with \nreviewing and revising the policy on course and minor program changes \nRecommendation: THAT the delegated authority to ratify new course designators and to approve re-\nnumbering of courses move from the Executive Committee to the Academic Standards Committee \nNew Programs \nProposals for new programs go through many stages of internal approval the majority of which require \nultimate submission to the government. Once approved by Faculty Council and prior to submission to \nAPC, the proposal goes to ASC-SOS and ASC for approval of admission, transfer, and academic standing \nregulations; new courses are approved through course circulation; and final program approval occurs at \nAPC (except in the cases of new credentials which are approved by the Board).  \nTo contribute to a cohesive and robust process, it is recommended that ASC could play an additional \nadvisory role with new program proposals. Currently, ASC is restricted to admissions, transfer and \nacademic standing. Allowing ASC to comment on other components of the program would provide a \ntighter proposal going forward to APC and fewer revisions. Not making change is a lost opportunity for \nimproving the quality of proposals that are submitted to the Ministry of Advanced Education and CAQC \nfor approval and resolving issues when new policies of a program impact students in other Faculties.  \nASC’s powers would be limited where proposed new programs or certificates or changes to existing \nprograms or certificates involved cooperation with other post-secondary institutions, requirements for \nnew or renovated facilities, additional funding or space, program changes that represent a definite \ndeparture from current policy or articulate a new academic concept, or where the changes would \nrequire government approval. In these cases, ASC would provide a recommendation to APC which would \ncontinue to hold the delegated authority to approve. \nASC should be given greater authority over content matters in new program proposals or in changes to \nexisting programs. ASC should be mandated to recommend to APC on all academic aspects including the \nstructure of new programs and changes to existing programs. New course proposals that accompany \nnew programs or changes to existing programs should be reviewed at the same time, and approval \npermitted pending the circulation process. Should the circulation process raise concerns, the matter \nwould be referred back to ASC for resolution.  \nRecommendation: THAT the role of Academic Standards Committee be expanded to allow the \ncommittee to comment on all academic portions of program proposals including program structure of \nnew programs and changes to programs \nRecommendation: THAT the Academic Standards Committee review and approve courses associated \nwith new programs, subject to challenge through the normal course circulation process \nv. GFC April 21, 2017\n16 \nSuspension and Termination of Programs \nCurrently, program terminations are considered and recommended by APC to GFC for recommendation \nto the Board of Governors. The Academic Standards Committee, on the other hand, has the delegated \nauthority to approve program suspensions. This creates a situation where APC may receive a proposal to \nterminate a program that has been suspended for five years and would be difficult to re-establish if the \ntermination was not approved. In addition, when a program renewal is being proposed, it is not unusual \nthat some programs are suspended to allow current students to complete while new programs are \nbeing introduced to replace the suspended programs. Having these two processes handled by different \ncommittees makes the process unwieldy for the proposers without giving the committees a full picture \nof the proposal.  As APC is recommending to GFC on terminations, it is reasonable for that committee to \nalso approve suspensions. ASC should be given authority to recommend to APC on both suspension and \ntermination of programs and be responsible for vetting the Calendar language for such proposals; final \napproval would rest with APC. \nRecommendation: THAT the delegated authority to approve the suspension of a program move from \nAcademic Standards Committee to the Academic Planning Committee \nRecommendation: THAT the Academic Standards Committee recommend to the Academic Planning \nCommittee on program terminations and suspensions and vet the Calendar language for such \nproposals \nProgram Changes \nGiven the recommendation above to alter the role of ASC with regard to reviewing and recommending \non new programs and termination of proposals, the ad hoc committee believes adjustments should be \nmade with regard to ASC’s authority to make recommendations regarding program changes. A move in \nthis direction will add to system coherence, while ensuring issues that might arise in other units are \nidentified prior to final approval by APC.  \nRecommendation: THAT the Academic Standards Committee recommend to the Academic Planning \nCommittee on program changes \nCertificate Programs \nASC has the delegated authority to approve establishment, termination, and changes to credit and non-\ncredit certificates from all Faculties except where new funding or space is needed or the certificate \nrequires government approval. At this point in time, all free-standing for-credit certificates require \napproval by government; embedded certificates are approved internally. While it makes sense for \ncertificates with resource implications to be further considered by APC, in seems incongruous that \ncertificates requiring government approval must be approved through APC and the Board Learning and \nDiscovery Committee when degree programs (which are not new credentials) are approved by APC. It \nwould make sense that certificates with no resource requirements be approved by ASC unless they \ncontravene the principles of delegated authority approved by GFC by, for example, involving multiple \nFaculties or large numbers of students. \nRecommendation: THAT the Academic Standards Committee be given the delegated authority to \napprove establishment, termination and changes to certificates for all Faculties; those requiring \nadditional funding and/or space would be recommended to the Academic Planning Committee for \napproval \nv. GFC April 21, 2017\n17 \nProposals from the Centre collégial de l’Alberta (CCA) \nThe first college level diploma program to be offered by CCA was approved by the Board of Governors in \nJune 2011. This represented a new level of programming for the University of Alberta and an \nappropriate governance pathway needed to be developed. In December 2012, the GFC Executive \nCommittee, on behalf of GFC, approved the motion to delegate authority to approve the establishment \nand termination of diploma programs offered by CCA to the Academic Planning Committee (APC) except \nin cases where a new funding model is proposed.  The ad hoc committee noted that the Academic \nStandards Committee (ASC) has delegated authority with respect to credit and non-credit certificates \nregardless of the proposing academic unit (except where there is no funding or space requirements, or \ngovernment approval required) and is thus experienced in reviewing program proposals. It is felt that \nASC would provide an added value to proposals and it is recommended that this delegated authority be \nchanged. \nRecommendation: THAT the Academic Standards Committee be given delegated authority to approve \nthe establishment, termination and changes to college level diploma and certificate programs from \nthe Centre collégial de l’Alberta; those requiring additional funding and/or space would be \nrecommended to the Academic Planning Committee for approval \nGFC / BOARD OF GOVERNORS RELATIONS \nFor the university’s bicameral governance system to work efficiently, it is important to recognize the \nBoard’s role as steward of physical, financial and human assets, and GFC’s mandate over academic \nissues. Interaction and overlap of these roles is unavoidable and it is important to use these as \nopportunities to understand each other and benefit from the expertise of each body.  \nThe ad hoc committee noted that currently the primary formal interaction of these two bodies occurs in \nthe context of an annual joint briefing of the Academic Planning Committee (APC) and the Board on the \nuniversity’s Comprehensive Institutional Plan (CIP). This event provides a valuable opportunity for the \ntwo bodies to exchange views on the budget, institutional priorities, and strategic directions, while \nproviding important feedback to administration. With greater awareness of the value of this opportunity, \nmembers of APC could do more to take advantage of this annual briefing.  \nThere is also regular interaction between the Board and GFC by way of representation and reporting. \nThere are seven members of GFC who also serve on the Board, one of which is the GFC elected \nrepresentative on the Board; the others are the President and Chair of GFC, the Presidents of both the \nStudents’ Union and the Graduate Students’ Association, appointed members of the AASUA and NASA, \nand an elected undergraduate student. The elected GFC representative provides written reports of \nactivities and decisions to both GFC and the Board. These are included on the agendas as information \nitems and members may ask for the report to be brought to the discussion part of the agenda. The ad \nhoc committee noted that this is a passive flow of information and suggested that the GFC \nrepresentative may wish to give a verbal report to GFC upon occasion, as this would provide a more \ninteractive form of reporting.  Further, the Chair of GFC may use the regular report of the Chair to \nprovide updates to GFC on the activities of the Board. The ad hoc committee concluded, however, that \nthe most valuable opportunity for creating inter-body dialogue in the context of reporting would take \nthe form of an invitation to the Chair of the Board to attend and report verbally to a meeting of GFC. \nv. GFC April 21, 2017\n18 \nThis initiative, and the others suggested above, would deepen the relationship of understanding \nbetween GFC and the Board. \nRecommendation: THAT the Chair of the Board of Governors be invited annually to speak at a GFC \nmeeting  \nThe value of holding an annual joint Board/GFC meeting is well supported and would provide a forum to \ndiscuss large issues such as strategic directions, budget, facilities, or other pressing issues that would \nbenefit from having the multiple perspectives of both groups present. The topic and timing of the \nsession would, ideally, be set through a process of consultation involving the President, GFC Executive, \nand the Board.  \nRecommendation: THAT an annual joint meeting between the Board and GFC be established \nRecommendation: THAT the Chair of GFC Executive Committee consult annually with GFC Executive \nand the Board on the focus and goals the annual joint meeting of the Board and GFC \nIn considering approaches to improving GFC-Board relations, the ad hoc committee considered a \nnumber of options, ranging from planning joint orientation sessions to establishing a joint Board/GFC \ncommittee focused on strategic issues of relevance to both GFC and the Board. The committee \nconcluded that facilitating interactions was, at this stage, preferable to institutionalizing joint structures. \nAs such, these sorts of proposals are not put forward as recommendations at this time.  \nORIENTATION AND EDUCATION \nOrientation and Education are key components of a well-functioning GFC. If done well, it can provide \nmembers of the university community with opportunities to become familiar with the structures and \nprocesses of governance, while also ensuring GFC members understand their roles and responsibilities. \nEffective orientation helps set expectations regarding participation, and this supports individuals who \nwish to be effective members of GFC. After reviewing the current orientation and education processes, \nthe ad hoc committee concluded that a more robust orientation and education effort is important to \naddressing weaknesses in GFC and strengthening academic governance. The committee believes \nenhanced education and orientation will empower GFC members, strengthen their engagement in GFC \nand its committees, clarify roles and responsibilities, and help address perceived and real power \nimbalances between members of the academy.  \nGeneral GFC and GFC Committee Orientation \nOrientation sessions should provide both high level governance information and detailed information on \nthe responsibilities of members, voting protocol, seating, how meetings are structured, question period \nprocedures, how members can report back to their constituencies, and how to get items on the agenda.  \nIt is important to recognize that committee orientation must be designed in light of the fact that those \nat-large members who do not sit on GFC may require additional attention. The ad hoc committee \nrecommends that orientation and orientation materials should be provided in a number of modes and \nformats, including stand-alone orientation workshops, briefings at meetings, and through widely \navailable written and online materials. A GFC member handbook or guidebook would be an ideal \nreference tool.  \nIn light of the unique character of collegial academic governance, GFC members should be encouraged \nv. GFC April 21, 2017\n19 \nto use orientation sessions to meet and get to know their fellow members and create networks which \ncan provide informal support and community building opportunities.  The following recommendations \nfocus on improving orientation to prepare GFC and committee members to be informed and active \nparticipants in academic governance.  \nRecommendation: THAT a variety of orientation sessions be offered including a general orientation to \ngovernance (Governance 101), followed by orientations more specific to GFC and GFC standing \ncommittees, and follow up sessions through the year \nRecommendation: THAT the responsibilities of members be clearly outlined in a core GFC document \nRecommendation: THAT a comprehensive GFC and committee member guidebook be made widely \navailable to members wanting a single reference for all the information they require to be effective in \ntheir roles  \nCommittee Chair and Vice-Chair Orientation \nOrientation for Committee Chairs and Vice-Chairs should include a discussion of delegated authority, \nresponsibilities regarding reporting to GFC, and meeting procedures, including issues such as when \nChairs vote and how to step out of the Chair to participate in debates and discussions. The ad hoc \ncommittee is particularly insistent that Chair and Vice-Chair orientations should examine the \nresponsibility of GFC Committees to refer matters to full GFC if they are uncertain whether the item falls \nwithin their delegated authority or the significance of the issue and division of opinion on the issues \nsuggest it should be discussed and debated by GFC itself. These orientations should also include the \nelected Vice-Chairs of GFC committees. As this orientation is normally held early in September, some \nchanges may be required to accommodate the timing of the Vice-Chair election. \nRecommendation: THAT orientation for Chairs and Vice-Chairs include a focus on delegated authority \nand reporting to GFC, including the responsibility of GFC Committees to refer matters to full GFC if \nthey are uncertain whether the item falls within their delegated authority or the significance of the \nissue and division of opinion on the issues suggest it should be discussed and debated by GFC itself \nOngoing Governance Education \nEducation is also a necessary component that should not be restricted only to members of GFC and GFC \ncommittees. Governance has an impact on the work of many in the university community and an \nunderstanding of the governance system will serve to increase engagement, while also deepening the \nunderstanding that those who make proposals to governance have of the processes, requirements, and \ntime lines associated with submitting proposals and securing approval of submissions. This can be \naccomplished in a variety of ways including adding governance sessions to the new staff and the senior \nadministration orientations and greater visibility through The Quad, President’s communique, and at \nFaculty Councils.  \nRecommendation: THAT governance sessions be included with new staff and senior administration \norientations \nRecommendation: THAT measures be taken to increase the profile and relevance of GFC, through the \npromotion of education sessions further to Governance 101 that are aimed at the wider university \ncommunity \nv. GFC April 21, 2017\n20 \nTASK ORIENTED COMMITTEES \nA number of the committees of GFC can be referred to as task oriented in that they have very specific \nroles and timelines to operate under. The ad hoc committee considered that the following committees \nwould fit under this category: \n• Campus Law Review Committee (CLRC) \n• University Teaching Awards Committee (UTAC) \n• Undergraduate Awards and Scholarship Committee (UASC) \n• Replenishment Committee (RC) \nIn general, these committees were seen to be working well and no major changes were recommended \nat this time. Both CLRC and UTAC have very well defined mandates and the delegated authority given to \nthese committees is also well defined.   \nNo significant issues have been noted with CLRC. Based on the work of this committee and the matters \nthat have come before it in recent years, it was emphasized that having a Chair with legal training who \nwould have a full understanding of these matters is highly advantageous. The terms were revised to \nexpress a strong preference for this training rather than as a requirement as it may not always be \npossible to find such a person willing and able to serve as Chair and there may be others in the \nuniversity community who have the expertise that would also qualify them even if they are not legally \ntrained.   \nRecommendation: THAT a strong preference be given to appointing a member with legal training as \nChair of the Campus Law Review Committee  \nUASC is also operating within its mandate which does not overlap with other standing committees, \nhowever there were a number of items that the committee indicated may no longer be relevant to its \nwork, such as minimum award values. An expanded mandate should be explored for this committee in \nthe medium term and further details on this appear later in the report.  \nRecommendation: THAT no major changes be made to the Campus Law Review Committee, the \nUniversity Teaching Awards Committee or the Undergraduate Awards and Scholarship Committee at \nthis time  \nThe only task assigned to the Replenishment Committee is to provide recommendations to GFC for \nmembers to serve on the Executive Committee and the Nominating Committee. Should GFC move to a \nfree-standing Nominating Committee, there will no longer be the need for a Replenishment Committee \nand it would be disbanded. In the meantime, no changes are recommended for this committee. \nRecommendation: THAT no changes be made to the Replenishment Committee and that it be \ndisbanded once the Nominating Committee is established and appropriate processes are in place to do \nits tasks. \nAREAS AND COMMITTEE REQUIRING ONGOING WORK AND CONSULTATION \nCouncil on Student Affairs (COSA) \nIn developing the guiding principles presented in this report, the ad hoc committee discussed the \ncommitment to providing a structure that allows for the active and engaged participation of all \nv. GFC April 21, 2017\n21 \nmembers. Through the review process, it was apparent that there was frustration on the part of \nstudents, administration and other GFC members in a perceived lack of discussion on issues involving \nstudents at GFC. It was also noted that students feel that better student consultation and input is \nneeded, rather than more student consultation and input. \nUnder the PSLA, “A general faculties council may establish a council on student affairs to exercise \nimmediate jurisdiction over student affairs with respect to any matters and in any manner the general \nfaculties council determines and to exercise or perform any other powers, duties and functions the \ngeneral faculties council determines”. At the University of Alberta, a Council on Student Affairs (COSA) \nwas first established in 1966. Since that time, COSA has gone through active periods where it dealt with \nmatters aimed at improving the quality of student life (student life, student services and programming, \nforum for discussion, and communication and cooperation among all offices and organizations), and \nother times where it has laid dormant. COSA’s terms of reference are approved by GFC and it is called \nupon to report to GFC annually on its activities but it does not exist under the governance structure that \nGFC and its standing committees do.  \nA review of the current status of COSA, including meeting materials and discussions, indicated that COSA \nis not viewed as serving a valuable purpose but is limited to information sharing, infrequent meetings \nand limited records of discussion. There is a lack of clarity on the mandate and role of COSA and how it \nfits into academic governance. This has led to a period of inactivity for this group and led to questions \nabout its viability and usefulness.  \nThe ad hoc committee is recommending that COSA be re-imagined to become a more formal part of the \ngovernance system. This would involve a re-structuring of COSA to align it with the guiding principles \npresented in this report with a GFC member as Chair and support provided by University Governance; \nthe meeting schedule and support would then mirror that of the GFC standing committees. This \nformalization of its status would also provide for improved linkages between COSA and GFC and its \nstanding committees. This change would contribute to an improved sense of commitment on the part \nCOSA members and allow issues affecting students to be presented, discussed and carried to a vote. \nDocumentation would then form part of proposals proceeding to GFC or its standing committees and \nassure these bodies that a substantial discussion had occurred at COSA and student perspectives were \nincluded. This would not, however, replace those targeted consultations necessary with specific groups \nof students on certain issues.   \nThe ad hoc committee recommends that GFC Executive establish a working group to revise COSA terms \nof reference in alignment with the guiding principles for GFC and its committees. The revision should \nconsider giving COSA responsibility to recommend and provide advice to GFC, its Executive Committee, \nand/or the GFC Academic Planning Committee (APC) on the matters which:  \n• focus on the quality of co-curricular student life on all campuses (student services, residence \nlife, athletics, etc) \n• focus on quality of life for groups of students on campuses (aboriginal students, international \nstudents, etc) \n• focus on curricular issues that impact a majority of students (Academic schedule, etc) \nv. GFC April 21, 2017\n22 \nCOSA could be the first mechanism through which the above issues are raised; particular issues may be \ndelegated to more appropriate bodies.  In addition, COSA may hear reports from administrative \ncommittees that are not part of the governance process, but are the key first step in the consultation \nprocess. \nRecommendation: THAT COSA be brought under the governance umbrella and be supported by \nUniversity Governance  \nRecommendation: THAT the GFC Executive Committee establish a working group to revise the COSA \nterms of reference in accordance with the principles of GFC and its standing committees and reflect a \nrole and mandate that gives student issues a well-defined venue for discussion and a clear pathway \nfor comments to reach GFC  \nRecommendation: THAT the current COSA remain in place in the interim and be disbanded when no \nlonger needed  \nCommittee on the Learning Environment (CLE) \nCLE is engaged in work that speaks to a core mission of the University – teaching and learning. The \ncommittee, however, holds no delegated authority, reports to two other standing committees \n(Executive and APC), may be perceived to be informational rather than action driven, and is guided by \nvague words such as fostering, nurturing, and promoting in its terms of reference.  The committee is \npopulated by well qualified, committed individuals who could contribute in a more focused manner with \na clearer mandate. \nThe ad hoc committee recommends that CLE be directed to do further work toward revising its terms of \nreference. This effort should consider the following:  \n• Could the terms of reference use language that is clearer and stronger than ‘nurturing, \npromoting, and fostering’? \n• Should CLE have a reporting structure that has the committee submit reports to and engaging in \nongoing dialogue on those reports with GFC Executive? \n• Should CLE have responsibility to recommend to GFC on broad policy directions, including with \nregard to policy directions for excellence in teaching and learning and making recommendations \nregarding the learning environment, both of which are currently matters included in APC’s terms \nof reference? \n• Could CLE clarify and potentially expand its mandate with respect to Learning Services and the \nCentre for Teaching and Learning? \n• Should there be changes to composition of CLE? For example: remove Vice-President (Research), \nadd a Librarian (A 1.4) to boost linkage between GFC and Learning Services, add a sessional staff \nmember (A2.1), elect rather than appoint a Dean, and reduce the number of appointed \nAssociate Deans from two to one. \nRecommendation: THAT the responsibility to “recommend to GFC on broad policy directions for \nexcellence in teaching and learning in a manner that ensures accountability of all Faculties in this \nmatter” be moved to the Committee on the Learning Environment from the Academic Planning \nCommittee \nv. GFC April 21, 2017\n23 \nRecommendation: THAT committee composition be changed as follows: remove Vice-President \n(Research) and one Associate Dean, add a Librarian (A 1.4) to boost linkage between GFC and Learning \nServices, add a sessional staff member (A2.1), elect rather than appoint a Dean \nUndergraduate Awards and Scholarship Committee (UASC) \nThis standing committee continues to provide a valuable service to GFC in approving undergraduate \nawards; however, input received during this review point to the potential of this committee to play a \nstrategic role in the awards process to ensure alignment with institutional goals. The committee could \nalso play a more defined role in monitoring the awards process. Alignment between undergraduate and \ngraduate awards could be explored further by the committee and the Faculty of Graduate Studies and \nResearch (FGSR) Graduate Scholarship Committee.  \nThe Student Financial Support Office should provide an Annual Report to UASC on the previous year’s \naward cycle, highlighting issues in the application process or where awards are not given out. UASC \nshould have a role in monitoring awards, with particular attention being paid to issues or problems in \nthe application process, or with awards that are not given out due to problems with award criteria.  \nUASC’s role in policy development should be strengthened with an explicit reference to how awards \npolicy can assist in the implementation of the Institutional Strategic Plan, For the Public Good. Policy \nrecommendations should continue to be sent to GFC Executive Committee. UASC should provide an \nAnnual Report to GFC, highlighting the number and value of new awards, any changes to existing awards \nor awards policy, and any discussion which has taken place on any proposals within UASC’s mandate. \nThis would provide GFC members insight as to the direction that the awards process is taking within the \nuniversity, and potential problems and issues. \nRecommendation: THAT the Undergraduate Awards and Scholarship Committee work with relevant \nstakeholders to propose revisions to the committee’s terms of reference to provide a more strategic \nand comprehensive mandate and role  \nProposals from the Faculty of Graduate Studies and Research (FGSR) \nFurther work should be conducted to articulate more explicitly the unique nature of FGSR Council in \ndeveloping policies that apply to all graduate students and what the approval route should be for these \nchanges. Due to the breadth of representation at FGSR Council, and considering that graduate students \nexist across the university, the question of whether FGSR Council should be recommending directly to \nGFC as opposed to ASC and/or APC on some matters should be explored.  \nRecommendation: THAT further work and consultation occur with FGSR and Governance to develop a \nproposal for approval pathways that recognizes the unique nature of the Faculty \nFaculty Councils \nWithin the structure of academic governance, there is an apparent disconnect between Faculty Councils \nand GFC. The PSLA lays out GFC’s authority with respect to Faculty Councils but it is unclear how these \nbodies relate to each other in practice.  \nThe ad hoc committee recommends that further work occur on this item including:   \n• Delegated authority from GFC to Faculty Councils, and subsequent sub-delegations, should be \nidentified and curated  \nv. GFC April 21, 2017\n24 \n• Ensure membership, quorum requirements, and terms of reference are easily accessible on the \nUniversity Governance website and that GFC’s role in approving these is clear \n• Provide links on the University Governance website to Faculty Council information for each \nFaculty  \n• Develop a clear reporting/communication structure from GFC members to their respective \nFaculties \nRecommendation: That the link between GFC and Faculty Council be more clearly defined and \ndelegated authority be identified and curated \nOther Delegations \nGFC’s delegations to standing committees have become clearer through this process. It is abundantly \nclear, however, that there are many places where GFC has delegated authority for approval to other \nbodies and officers.  \nRecommendation: That the Governance staff continue to work to identify and curate the list of GFC \ndelegated authorities to other bodies and officers, and report the results of these efforts to GFC \nExecutive Committee for consideration in the context of ongoing evaluations and reforms to academic \ngovernance \nTERMS OF REFERENCE \nTo ensure consistency across the terms of reference, the ad hoc committee developed a standard \ntemplate that contains the following: \n1. Mandate and Role – the new terms state clearly and concisely the role of the committee  \n2. Areas of Responsibility – provides a general list of what types of matters are considered by the \ncommittee  \n3. Committee Composition – now specified in accordance with Principles of Committee Composition \ndocument that accompanies this report \n4. Delegated Authority from General Faculties Council – provides a quick list of matters that the \ncommittee has authority to approve \n5. Responsibilities Additional to Delegated Authority – provides an overview of those matters on which \nthe committee considers and/or recommends, but does not have the authority to approve \n6. Sub-delegations from Committee – provides a quick list of those delegated authorities which have \nbeen sub-delegated by the committee to other bodies or officers \n7. Limitations to Authority – provides a list of the limits to the delegated authorities listed in section 4 \n8. Reporting to GFC – committees are required to regularly report to GFC on their activities and \ndecisions \n9. Definitions – provided as required \n10. Links – to other documents which are related to the committee such as policy and procedures, and \nother committees \nGFC and all committee terms of reference must be approved by GFC. The draft terms of reference \nprepared by the ad hoc committee will need to be reviewed, amended or completed, and approved by \nthe relevant committee, prior to being forwarded to full GFC for consideration and approval. The ad hoc \nv. GFC April 21, 2017\n25 \ncommittee recommends that a review of each committee’s terms of reference occur every three years, \nor more often if required.  \nMAJOR CHANGES TO TERMS OF REFERENCE \nIn addition to the new format, there are a number of changes that are reflected in most or all \ncommittee terms of reference: \n• Inclusion of a Vice-Chair elected by the committee from the academic staff members, ideally a GFC \nmember \n• Addition of more GFC elected members and fewer at large and appointed members \n• Procedural matters have been removed from terms of reference and included in a separate \ndocument on Procedural Rules for GFC and its Standing Committees \n• Sections which were outdated or covered in policies or other documents have been removed (eg \nmatters covered by FOIP legislation and references to residence codes) \nIn addition, the attached terms of reference will reflect the recommendations included in the report. \nSome of the major changes are: \n• The Academic Planning Committee be replaced by the Academic and Research Planning Committee \nwith a higher profile to the research responsibilities of the committee  \n• There was extensive discussion about the ‘routine and urgent’ mandate of the Executive Committee. \nThe terms of reference now articulate what falls under the authority of Executive Committee and \ndelineates how that committee should approach matters to which it is acting on behalf of GFC which \ncannot wait until the next GFC meetings \n• Oversight of governance rules and procedures was added to the responsibilities of the Executive \nCommittee \n• Establishment of a free-standing Nominating Committee \n• Moving approval authority for program suspensions from Academic Standards Committee to \nAcademic Planning Committee \n• Ratification of course designators and course renumbering moved from Executive to Academic \nStandards Committee \n• Allowing Academic Standards Committee to provide comments on new program proposals beyond \nadmission, transfer and academic standing. Recognizing that the expertise and breadth of \nexperience of that committee, this will provide a value-added component to the proposal before it \nmoved onto Academic Planning Committee. \nFUTURE WORK TO BE DONE \nCOMPOSITION OF GENERAL FACULTIES COUNCIL \nThrough this review, the ad hoc committee recognized that it had not tackled the important issue of the \nsize of GFC itself. A decision-making body of 158 members composed of administration, faculty, \nstudents, and other constituencies is not ideally suited for the sorts of meaningful conversations and \ndebates that should animate collegial academic governance. Over the years, the challenges associated \nwith handling the many decisions and approvals originally envisioned as the responsibility of GFC have \nv. GFC April 21, 2017\n26 \nbeen dealt with by moving much of its work to the committees where smaller, more agile groups can \naccomplish this in a streamlined fashion. This should free up full GFC to engage in substantive \ndiscussions of the most significant and pressing issues. As part of the renewal process, the ad hoc \ncommittee believes the composition of GFC should be examined to ensure that the body is achieving its \nmandate and capable of informed and meaningful debate. Ideally, once the recommendations in this \nreport have been implemented or initiated, GFC Executive will lead an effort to once again address the \nissue of the composition of GFC.  \nRecommendation: THAT the composition of General Faculties Council be reviewed on or before April \n2019 with the intention of decreasing its size, keeping in mind the parameters of the PSLA \nTRANSITIONING \nAll of these recommendations cannot, of course, be implemented immediately or at once. After GFC \napproval of the four guiding documents, and the terms of reference in principle, the detail work and \nconsultation will occur.  \nThe first step will be for the draft terms of reference to return to the committees for refinement. It is \nanticipated that there will be discussion and consultation related to specific recommendations and an \nevaluation of how some of the recommendations can be operationalized. Once the terms of reference \nare complete and endorsed by the committee, they will proceed to the Executive Committee and to GFC \nfor approval. A November 2017 target for these to come back to GFC for approval will be achievable for \nsome committees. Others will take longer but should be complete by April 2019. The current delegated \nauthorities and committee terms of reference will remain in place until such time as the new terms of \nreference are approved. \nAt the same time, further work will occur to develop direction and documents for the Council on \nStudent Affairs and matters related to Faculty Councils. Again, these should return to GFC on or before \nApril 2019. \nAs of April 30, 2017, the ad hoc committee will have completed its work. It is recommended that GFC \nExecutive establish a transition committee to complete the implementation phase of this project.  \nRecommendation: THAT the GFC Executive Committee establish a Transition Committee with \nrepresentatives from GFC Executive and the Ad Hoc Committee on Academic Governance Including \nDelegated Authority to advise and guide the implementation of the recommendations to be \ncompleted on or before April 2019 \nRecommendation: THAT the current delegated authorities and committee terms of reference remain \nin place until such time as the new terms of reference are approved by GFC \nFINAL WORD \nThe work ahead will improve academic governance for years to come; but it will not be the end of the \nreform. GFC exists in an ever-changing world and it is not possible to identify all of the new challenges \nand opportunities that will come forward in the next decades. Therefore, and in accordance with good \nv. GFC April 21, 2017\n27 \ngovernance principles, the terms of reference and delegations should be considered as living documents \nand subject to regular review. GFC Executive will play an important leadership role in this but not the \nonly role.  This is the ongoing responsibility of every standing committee and every member of GFC.  \nAt the beginning of the report we noted that the effectiveness of GFC is dependent upon structure, \nculture, and people. \nThe recommendations contained here are designed to ensure that the structure of GFC and its standing \ncommittees provides an environment that is clear, easy to understand and to participate in, and \nworkable on a day to day basis.  \nThe principles that form the foundation for the structural changes proposed reflect the culture of GFC \nand how it can operate with a common commitment to collegial governance, transparency and \nrespectful communication. \nBut finally, it is up to you as a member of the university community to choose to engage in the processes \nof collegial governance and make your contribution to the academic mission of this university. \nRespectfully submitted: \nMark Loewen, Chair \nSteve Patten, Vice-Chair \nMarina Banister \nDeborah Burshtyn  \nMarc de Montigny \nElaine Geddes \nJulie Naylor \nFrank Robinson \nLeigh Spanner \nBetty-jo Werthmann \nv.

GFC April 21, 2017\n1 of 2 \nGENERAL FACULTIES COUNCIL \nPrinciples of Delegation \nPrinciples for General Faculties Council Delegation of Authority \nIntroduction \nGovernance is understood as the process through which an organization defines and achieves \nits mandate, which includes making decisions with regard to the structures, policies, and \npractices of decision-making; the exercise of authority; and the mechanisms of accountability.  \nGeneral Faculties Council (GFC) has employed a structure that relies upon the delegation of its \nprovincially-mandated authorities to its standing committees, individuals on campus and other \ncampus bodies.  Delegation is essential to ensure timely and efficient decision-making in \nsmaller forums with access to appropriate resource people, while allowing GFC to focus on \nsubstantive and strategic issues of broad relevance to the university community.  The following \noffers guidance to this delegation structure and helps maintain accountability, transparency, and \ncollegiality in the academic governance system at the University of Alberta. \nRetained Authority \nGeneral Faculties Council shall pursue major policy and strategic issues that include: \n● significant strategic and policy issues related to the academic affairs of the university;\n● any matter involving the alteration of the mandate, terms of reference, membership, or\nstructure of a GFC standing committee; and\n● those matters that a standing committee, body, or officer holding delegated authority\nfrom GFC considers to be of major strategic significance or long-term impact on the\nuniversity.\nPrinciples \n1. Delegations of authority must be reasonable in scope and appropriate to the character and\ncapacity of the body (e.g. council or committee) or officer receiving the delegated authority. \n2. An officer or body acting with delegated authority is accountable to the body which\ndelegated the authority and must report to that body in a timely and sufficiently detailed\nfashion on actions taken under the delegated authority.\n3. An officer or body is responsible to be alert to situations where, for example, there is\nuncertainty as to whether an item falls within the intended delegation or the significance of\nan issue and the division of opinion on the issue suggest it is prudent to refer the issue or\ndecision to the delegating body for consideration. When there is uncertainty as to whether\nan item falls within the intended delegated authority, or if there is clear division of opinion,\nthe officer or body with delegated authority will refer the item to the body that delegated the\nauthority along with a recommendation.\n4. Delegations should be recorded in written form and curated in a transparent manner.\n29 v. GFC April 21, 2017\nAppendix 1\n2 of 2 \nGENERAL FACULTIES COUNCIL \nPrinciples of Delegation \n 5. A body delegating authority may impose restrictions on that authority -- including restrictions \non the authority to sub-delegate -- so long as the restrictions allow sufficient authority for the \ndelegation to be meaningful. \n6. All delegations of authority should be reviewed at regular intervals (ideally once every three \nyears) to ensure they remain appropriate. \n7. Withdrawal of delegated authority should be considered judiciously based on the best \ninterest of the institution and cannot be done retroactively. \n8. An officer or body is not compelled to exercise delegations. The fact that a delegation is held \ndoes not oblige the officer or body to exercise the delegation if, in the opinion of the \ndelegate, some special or unusual circumstances are involved which make it sensible that \nthe issue should receive consideration at a more senior level. \nApproved by General Faculties Council: <insert date> \n30 v. GFC April 21, 2017 \n1 of 1 \nGENERAL FACULTIES COUNCIL \nPrinciples of Committee Composition \nPrinciples for General Faculties Council Standing Committee Composition \nIntroduction \nGovernance at the University of Alberta relies upon a structure wherein the General Faculties \nCouncil has delegated many of its provincially-mandated authorities to its standing committees.  \nAs such, the composition of those standing committees is crucial to ensuring that decisions are \nmade in an informed manner that takes into account the breadth of issues, perspectives and \nopinions on campus.  The following principles provide a framework to create committee \ncompositions which are reflective of the membership of GFC and appropriate to the role and \nmandate of those committees.  \nPrinciples \n1. Wherever possible, the majority of elected members of each standing committee should be\ndrawn from the membership of GFC to provide tangible links between GFC and its standing\ncommittees and increase engagement of the greater GFC community.\n2. Wherever possible, the number of elected members of a standing committee should exceed\nthe number of ex-officio members.\n3. The voting status of ex-officio members of standing committees should be consistent with\ntheir voting status on GFC and should extend to their delegates.\n4. Ex-officio members should be included in the membership of a standing committee only\nwhen their portfolio is directly relevant to the mandate and role of the standing committee.\n5. Wherever possible, the Vice-Chair of a standing committee should be elected by the\ncommittee from its elected academic staff members and ideally be a member of GFC.\n6. Standing Committees should be populated with a commitment to diversity and broad\nrepresentation from across the university.\n7. When cross-appointment of members on standing committees is appropriate, this should be\noutlined in the terms of reference of each committee and such members shall have voting\nstatus on both committees.\nApproved by General Faculties Council: <insert date> \n31 v.

GFC rules are not meant to \nunduly restrict debate or limit opportunities for participation. Their purpose is to facilitate \ninclusive and respectful dialogue, while ensuring efficient decision-making. It is the responsibility \nof the Chair, with the support of GFC, to employ the rules governing general meetings in a \nmanner consistent with these principles. Substantive motions should be handled with \nconsiderable formality, but whenever possible the Chair should deal with matters of procedure \nby general agreement. \nThe following rules and procedures are based on a number of fundamental principles that \nencourage participation and engagement of members. These principles include: \n• A commitment to inclusive and participatory decision-making. \n• A commitment to openness, transparency and respectful communication. \n1.  Procedural Rules  \n1.1  GFC and its standing committees are governed by the procedural rules set out below. \nFor matters not covered by these rules, or by the Post Secondary Learning Act (PSLA) \nreference shall be made to the current edition of Robert's Rules of Order. If this does \nnot provide clear direction regarding a point in question, then the Chair shall decide \nhow to proceed. However, such rulings by the Chair may be overruled via a motion \nsupported by a vote of the majority of those present.  \n1.2  The chairs of GFC and its standing committees will be responsible for guiding \nmeetings of GFC and its standing committees, enforcing rules, and deciding questions \npertaining to those rules. Any decisions of the chair are subject to challenge (see \n10.3). \n1.3 The Chair will not participate actively in debate regarding a motion before GFC without \npassing the role of the Chair to the Vice-Chair for the duration of the debate and the \nsubsequent vote.  \n2. Meetings \n 2.1 GFC and its standing committees shall meet regularly during the academic year, the \nschedule of which will be published on the governance website at least one month \nbefore the beginning of each academic year. GFC meetings will not be scheduled \nduring the period set aside for final examinations or Reading Week, however \ncommittee meetings may occur during this time. \n 2.2 Cancellation - GFC Executive Committee may cancel a meeting of GFC if it \ndetermines that the number and nature of the agenda items make it reasonable to \ndefer consideration, and provided that notice of such cancellation is given to members \nat least one week prior to the date of the meeting. The Chair of a GFC standing \ncommittee may cancel a meeting if the agenda items make it reasonable to defer \n34 v. GFC April 21, 2017 \n2 of 6 \nGENERAL FACULTIES COUNCIL \nMeeting Procedural Rules   \n consideration, and provided that notice of such cancellation is given to members as \nearly as possible.  \n 2.3  From time to time, the Chair of GFC may call special meetings of GFC, provided that \nnotice of such meetings is given to members at least one month in advance.  \n 2.4 GFC meetings shall normally be scheduled and planned to end two hours after being \ncalled to order. \n 2.5 Debate on new items of business will not be entertained after GFC has been sitting for \nthree hours.  \n 2.6 No audio or video recording of meetings shall be permitted unless by express authority \nof the Chair. \n3.

Questions  \n5.1  If more information than is provided as part of the meeting agenda is required, \ninformation requests may be made of the University Governance office. \n5.2  Questions on an issue within GFC’s jurisdiction may be submitted in writing to the GFC \nSecretary up to six working days before the next GFC meeting to receive a written \nresponse. \n5.3  Every GFC meeting has Question Period as a standing item wherein members may \nraise a question during the time set aside for this item (see 6.5). Procedures for \nQuestion Period are available at governance.ualberta.ca \n5.4  Questions with regard to a specific item on an agenda may be raised during \nconsideration of that item at the GFC meeting. \n6.  Agendas \n 6.1  The agenda of each GFC meeting will be proposed by the GFC Executive Committee \nand approved by GFC. The GFC Executive Committee will ensure that items put \nbefore GFC are complete and ready for discussion and published in advance of the \nmeeting.  \n35 v.

In the event of a \nchallenge, the remaining members may choose to adjourn or continue the meeting. In \n36 v. GFC April 21, 2017 \nhttp://www.governance.ualberta.ca/en/GeneralFacultiesCouncil.aspx\n4 of 6 \nGENERAL FACULTIES COUNCIL \nMeeting Procedural Rules   \n the event of a decision to continue a meeting without quorum, the minutes shall record \nthis fact and any decisions taken must be ratified at the next meeting.  \n8. Motions \n 8.1 Normally, all motions concerning substantive matters shall be published in the agenda \nmaterials. \n 8.2 All motions must be moved and seconded by members of GFC.  Motions to appoint \nnew members may only be moved and seconded by statutory members of GFC. \n 8.3 Motions pass with a majority vote, except for the following: (1) motions to add an item \nto the agenda require a two-thirds majority of those present; (2) motions to rescind a \nmotion require a two-thirds majority of total members. \n 8.4 To make a motion, a member must be recognized by the Chair. (In the interest of \nclarity and to expedite business, it is advisable to provide a written motion to the GFC \nSecretary). The person making a motion will be invited by the Chair to speak first in \nany ensuing debate. \n 8.5 Amendments to Motions - A member may make a motion to amend the wording – \nand within certain limits the meaning – of a pending motion before the pending motion \nitself is voted upon. The amendment must be germane and cannot be used to \nintroduce a new subject. An amendment is debatable. \n 8.6 Motion to Adjourn - A motion to adjourn is a motion to close the meeting.

GFC April 21, 2017 \n5 of 6 \nGENERAL FACULTIES COUNCIL \nMeeting Procedural Rules   \n 10. Debate \n 10.1  Normally, a member may not speak for a second time until the Chair is satisfied that all \nmembers wishing to speak for their first time have done so. \n 10.2  A member who has the floor may not normally be interrupted. However, the Chair may \ninterrupt a speaker if the speaker is out of order by using unacceptable language, is \nabusive of other members, or is not speaking to the motion. If the Chair does not do \nso, a member may raise this as a point of order.  \n 10.3  Point of Order - It is the right of any member who notices a breach of the rules of \nCouncil to insist on their enforcement. If the Chair fails to notice such a breach, any \nmember may make the appropriate Point of Order, calling on the Chair for a ruling. A \nPoint of Order does not require a seconder, it is not debatable or amendable, and \ncannot be reconsidered.  \n 10.4  Calling the Question - Upon hearing a member call the question, the Chair will ask \nmembers if they are ready to vote on the motion being discussed. If there appears to \nbe opposition to closing the debate, the Chair may ask for a motion to close debate. If \nseconded, members will then vote on this motion and proceed accordingly.  \n11. Debates without Motions \n11.1  When discussion of an issue and the formal rules pertaining to making motions, \ndebate, and voting seem to be a hindrance to thoughtful discussion, the GFC agenda \ncan allow for a less structured discussion guided by the Chair and the consensus of \nthe members in attendance.  \n12. Attendance  \n 12.1 Delegates – members who serve on GFC or its standing committees by virtue of their \noffice may send a delegate; such delegates shall act with all the rights of membership.  \nThere shall be no alternates for other members. \n 12.2 GFC attendance - If a student misses two consecutive meetings or more than three \nmeetings, the Students’ Union or the Graduate Students’ Association may request that \nthe Chair declare the position vacant.

Voting  \n 13.1 All members of GFC are charged with the responsibility of examining issues before \nCouncil and voting as they judge fit on such issues. No member of GFC, regardless of \nhow that person gains membership on Council, is an instructed delegate. \n 13.2 Motions shall normally be adopted on a simple majority of members present except to \nadd items to the agenda which requires a two-thirds majority of those present, or for a \nMotion to Rescind which requires a two-thirds majority vote of total membership. \n38 v. GFC April 21, 2017 \n6 of 6 \nGENERAL FACULTIES COUNCIL \nMeeting Procedural Rules   \n  13.3  An abstention is not considered to be a vote cast.  \n 13.4 The Chair votes only in the instance of a tie. When there is a tie vote, the motion is lost \nif the Chair abstains.  \n 13.5 All members may participate in discussions; only voting members may move, second \nand vote on motions.  \n 13.6 Electronic Votes by Committees – In cases where extensive deliberation is not \nessential to determining a course of action and it is necessary for a business item to \nbe decided before the next scheduled meeting, the Chair and Secretary of a GFC \nstanding committee may hold an electronic vote. The motion will be duly moved and \nseconded and all normal procedures will be followed in conducting the e-mail ballot. \nHowever, upon receiving the item of business and ballot, any committee member may \nrequest that the matter be debated at the next meeting or at a special meeting and the \nvote delayed until after that debate, with the Chair determining the appropriate course \nof action.  \n 13.7 Electronic Votes by GFC – In cases where GFC is the electing body to populate \ncertain selection committees and other bodies, the election process may use e-vote \nmechanisms. \n 13.8 Electronic Approval of Committee Reports by GFC – Reports from the Nominating and \nReplenishment Committees may be distributed electronically to GFC members and are \nconsidered approved by the deadlines indicated on the report subject to receipt of \nadditional nominations.   \n14.

This includes making decisions with regard to the structures, policies, and practices of \ndecisionmaking, the exercise of authority, and the mechanisms of accountability.  \nUniversity governance is multi-level and bicameral. Provincial legislation – the Post-Secondary \nLearning Act (PSLA) – sets the framework for university governance. At the institutional level, the PSLA \nprescribes that UAlberta will have bicameral institutions of governance – that is, there are two \ngoverning bodies. The Board of Governors (the Board) oversees the business affairs of the institution – \nfrom appointing the President, through to approving budgets, investment strategies, collective \nagreements, and long-range strategic planning. The General Faculties Council (GFC) oversees \n‘academic affairs’.  \nTo understand the operations of the university, it is important to note the distinction between \n‘governance’ and ‘administration’. While the Board and GFC set policies and establish broad directions \nfor the institution, the university’s senior executive team is responsible for administrative operations, \nincluding operational policies and decisions. And this is replicated at the Faculty and Departmental \nlevels across the university. Good governance requires collegial practice at all levels including the \nBoard, the executive and all members of the institution.  \nThis ad hoc committee’s mandate pertains to reviewing academic governance at the institutional level. \nThus, we are to remain focused on the operations of GFC and its standing committees (including the \ndelegation of authority from GFC, the mandate and structure of committees, and related matters).  \nBut, as a matter of principle, we embrace a reasonably expansive understanding of ‘academic affairs’ \nand, thus, GFC’s mandate. We support the notion that GFC must have the capacity to defend its \nlegitimate role with regard to issues that exist at the boundary between governance and administration, \nas well as between Board and GFC responsibilities. We also support the notion that GFC should have \nearly opportunities to influence strategic decisions and directions that are set by the Board or \nadministration, but impinge on academic affairs.  \nGuiding Principles  \nAs a committee, we are committed to the principles of ‘collegial academic governance’. These \nprinciples include:  \n• A desire to build mutual understanding of common goals and shared purpose –\noperationalized in numerous ways, including the adoption of an institutional strategic plan.\n• A commitment to inclusive and participatory governance decision-making.\n• A desire to facilitate meaningful individual-level engagement in governance processes.\n• A commitment to openness, transparency, and respectful communication.\n• A commitment to responsiveness, respect, and reciprocity between governing bodies and\nbetween governing bodies and university administration.\nAppendix 4 \n82 v. GFC April 21, 2017\n2 of 2 \nGFC AD HOC COMMITTEE ON ACADEMIC GOVERNANCE \nINCLUDING DELEGATED AUTHORITY \nGuiding Principles \nFurther Guiding Elements  \nGuided by these principles, we begin our deliberations in agreement on the following:  \n• GFC must take seriously its responsibility for academic affairs, and commit to showing \nleadership on emerging issues and serving as a forum for discussing and taking decisions in \nthe interest of academic freedom, and excellence in research, creativity, and teaching and \nlearning.  \n• While the standing Committees of GFC should have real power to make (or initiate) \nsubstantive decisions, a commitment to regular and reciprocal communication should position \nGFC to ensure that its members retain the capacity to bring significant issues to the floor of \nGFC for debate and decision. Standing Committee chairs have a responsibility to identify \nissues that Standing Committee members feel are deserving of discussion by full GFC.  \n• The composition of GFC Standing Committees should reflect the principle of meaningful \nrepresentation of elected, appointed, and ex officio, and student, staff, and faculty \nmembership.  \n• While ensuring appropriate checks and balances are in place, appropriate consultations \noccur, and competing interests are always considered, GFC’s committee structure and \ndecision making processes should be designed to ensure streamlined pathways for the \nconsideration and, when desired, approval of proposals flowing from Faculties and other units \nwithin the University.  \n• Meetings of GFC must be conducted in a manner that encourages participation and \nengagement.  \n• Members of GFC, whether they are elected, appointed, or ex officio, student, staff, or faculty, \nshould be encouraged to represent the interests of any ‘constituency’ with which they are \naffiliated, while also considering competing interests and striving to consider (and define) the \nbroader institutional interest. This overview of the ad hoc committee’s guiding principles is, in \nmany ways, incomplete, but it reflects our starting point for considering the many issues \nbefore us. \nApproved by GFC: November 21, 2016 \n83 v.
