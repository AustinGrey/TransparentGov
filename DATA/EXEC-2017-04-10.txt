Members discussed the importance of an institutional communication and budget strategy to \nmanage this in the future and the Provost confirmed that this is being developed.   \nThe Chair also provided information in relation to new Board of Governors appointees, the search to identify \nSignature Areas at the academy, and For the Public Good performance measures. \nDISCUSSION ITEMS \n4.

A digital hub linking \nstudents to writing supports has been planned to help connect these services to those who may require it and to \nmake these services more visible to the community. \nThe recommendations include a reinvigoration of the University Writing Committee and that SWS be \ncoordinated centrally by the Office of the Provost and Vice-President (Academic) to ensure that all institutional \nsupports adhere to established principles. \nFollowing this summary, members emphasized the importance of the University Writing Committee and the role \nof the Chair of that body.

Attachment 3: Title Page, Table of Contents and Appendices (pages 1-19) \nPrepared by: Donna Herman, Special Advisor, Faculty and Staff Relations, donna.herman@ualberta.ca \nRevised: 4/4/2017 \nISSUE BRIEF – NEW ACADEMIC TEACHING STAFF AGREEMENT      March, 2017 \nAcademic Teaching Staff (ATS) Agreement to replace  \nContract Academic Staff: Teaching (CAS:T) Agreement: \nAn Agreement Review Committee (ARC) comprising members from Administration and the AASUA has \nbeen working together to consider revisions to the Contract Academic Staff: Teaching (CAS:T) \nAgreement. In April, 2014, the Board provided Administration with a mandate to: \n(1) Develop a University-wide academic performance evaluation and career progression model which \nwould demonstrate the University’s commitment to a teaching-intensive career path within the CAS:T \nAgreement; and \n(2) Establish greater position security by adopting a “contingent” appointment option for CAS:T \nAgreement staff members. \nThe work of the ARC has now brought us to the completion of the new Agreement and below are \nhighlights of the ATS Agreement (in contrast to the CAS:T Agreement that it will replace). Following Board \nand GFC Approval and AASUA ratification, the new Agreement will be implemented on July 1, 2017. \nSeveral Faculties have already adopted a Teaching Intensive Model under CAS:T with multi-year fixed or \nrolling terms (Arts, Business, FoMD – Dentistry, Nursing, Pharmacy, Physical Ed & Rec, Rehab Medicine, \nand Science). These Faculties will now be able to transition to the ATS Agreements, utilizing the \nappointment categories outlined. There will be no ability to hire into rolling terms but that job security is \nmaintained and enhanced through the introduction of the “contingent” appointment option. \nACADEMIC TEACHING STAFF (ATS) AGREEMENT \nDefinitions/ \nArticle/Appendix \nChange \n1.15 Senior Officer - Definition of administrators who have authority under the Agreement, and \nwhen read in conjunction with 4.3 (Delegation) clarifies the delegation of \nresponsibilities. \n1.16 Staff Member - This is a more descriptive definition of staff members who fall under the \nAgreement and broadens the funding sources that can be used. \n6. APPOINTMENTS \n- Each Faculty/Department will develop position profiles that describe the \nteaching workload and other University responsibilities. \n- This Agreement establishes ranks and standards (Full Lecturer, Associate \nLecturer, Assistant Lecturer and Instructor) with working titles continuing to \nbe Faculty-specific or with the option of using the ranks as the working \ntitles. \n- Provides the ability to hire into a full or part-time Term or Term Recurring  \nappointment to a maximum of 6 years in length where lay-off provision \ncontinues to apply for contracts greater than 12 months with 3 months’ \nnotice plus 1 month severance for each year of service to a maximum of 9 \nmonths; OR INTO \n- Provides the ability to hire into a full or part-time Career Status \nappointment where the contract does not specify an end date but is subject \nto termination as a result of: (1) duties of the position profile are no longer \nrequired; or (2) the position profile has changed and the staff member no \nlonger has the qualifications required to carry out the responsibilities; or (3) \nThe funding for the appointment is insufficient or is no longer available. The \nAppointee will receive no less than 12 months’ notice of termination. \n- Administration has committed to developing University-wide guidelines \nregarding: (1) procedures outlining the conversion of a Term appointment to \na Term Recurring of Career Status appointment and (2) factors which \ndetermine when funding for a Career Status appointment is no longer \navailable. \n- Provides more clarity regarding recruitment, advertising and “first \nconsideration” of current staff for appointments. \n7. RESPONSIBILITIES \nTO THE UNIVERSITY \n- Language more specifically tailored to this Agreement and encompassing \nteaching and teaching-related responsibilities. \n8. SUPPLEMENTARY \nPROFESSIONAL \nACTIVITY \n- Language more specifically tailored to this Agreement. Applies to full-time \nstaff members only with Career Status or with a Term Status appointment of \n12 months or greater. \n9. PROBATIONARY \nPERIOD \n- Establishment of probationary periods for Career Status and Fixed Term \nStatus appointments for a term greater than 24 months. \n10.

The instructor relationship is \nadded to the University system once an instructor’s employee ID is attached to a class. \nThe start date of the relationship coincides with the date that the course catalogue is \nreleased to campus. The end date of the relationship is the end date of the last term that \nthe instructor is attached to a course/courses + four months.  \nEmployees (EMP) = An employee is someone who has an employment relationship with \nthe University. All employees will have other simultaneous relationships that further \ndescribe their affiliation with the University (e.g., Student or Instructor). The employee \nrelationship is given to all persons that have an active job record in the University system \nThe start and end date of the relationship coincides with the start and end date of the \nemployment contract.  \nACCESS TO LICENSED ONLINE LIBRARY CONTENT \nThe University Libraries licenses a wide range of electronic journals, e-books, \nabstracting/indexing databases and numerical databases from commercial vendors. These \nlicenses restrict use of these resources to primary members of the University community, i.e. \ncurrent University students, faculty and staff (based on valid student or employee numbers). \nHowever, University Libraries licenses do permit \"walk-in\"/on-campus use by guest affiliates and \nthe wider community at public computer stations within the University Libraries or via the UWS. \nREMOTE ACCESS TO LICENSED ONLINE LIBRARY CONTENT  \nRemote access (from outside the University computing network) to licensed online library content \nby primary members of the University community requires login to the Library's EZproxy server \nusing a CCID. \nThe search for information from off campus begins within the University Libraries website at \nhttp://www.library.ualberta.ca. Ebooks, ejournals, databases, streaming video or audio, etc. can \nbe searched through various services within the website and before being linked through to the \ncontent, the searcher will be passed to the Libraries EZproxy service to login with CCID and \npassword.  \nLIBRARY CARDS AND BORROWING PRIVILEGES \nStaff members will use a University Staff ONEcard to borrow Library resources with a 4-month \nloan period for 14 months from the start date of their employment contract. \nhttp://www.library.ualberta.ca/remote/index.cfm\nhttp://ist.ualberta.ca/id\nhttp://www.library.ualberta.ca/\nPage | 8 of                         MAR’10’2017 \nAPPENDIX D: \nConditions for Supplementary Professional Activities (SPA) \n1. The authority and approval of SPA is subject to the following conditions: \na) The staff member shall not compete unfairly with professionals outside the University. \nb) The SPA shall not infringe upon the University’s conflict policy and related procedures and \nprotocols, as amended from time to time. \nc) The SPA shall conform with the University’s related policies, procedures and protocols \nrelated to the use of University facilities and staff, as amended from time to time. \n d) The staff member shall indemnify and hold harmless the University from and against any \nloss, injury or damage which the University may or could suffer arising in any way out of or \nin relation to such activities. The staff member gives this covenant and makes this \nagreement notwithstanding that the University has participated in such activities by the \nprovision of facilities, space, equipment, or administrative assistance, unless the said loss, \ninjury or damage arises directly from a malfunction of the said facilities or equipment which \nis not caused by the user thereof; and notwithstanding that the University has participated \nin such SPA by the provision of students or postdoctoral fellows or the like; and \nnotwithstanding that any formal contract with respect to those SPA has not been negotiated \nby or approved by the University. \ne) When engaged in SPA a staff member shall not use the name of the University in any way, \nexcept as the mailing address, nor shall the staff member hold himself or herself to be an \nagent of the University when engaged in SPA. \n2. SPA shall be taken into account in the evaluation of a staff member’s performance for increments \nand promotion.    \n3. The following information shall be provided in the staff member’s annual statement on SPA: \n a) the category or type of client or affiliation; \n b) the nature of services performed; \n c) an estimate of the total time devoted to each SPA; and \n d) the names and nature of any continuing contractual arrangements with outside \norganizations. \n4. SPA shall represent an integral part of the responsibility to relate theory to practice, thereby \nenabling teaching to remain professionally relevant. Routine, repetitive and trivial SPA is \ndiscouraged. \nRequired SPA \n5. A Faculty Council may deem SPA, and the maintenance of a professional license, to be essential \nto the work of the Department and to the progress of a staff member’s career. In such cases the \nDean and Department Chair shall encourage SPA. \n6. Where a Faculty Council has deemed SPA to be essential to the work of the Department, the \nFaculty Council shall recommend to the Board that such SPA be considered as part of the primary \nUniversity responsibilities. The Board may approve such recommendations on such conditions as it \ndeems appropriate, having regard to 1.a. \nMajor SPA \n7. SPA may be categorized as major or minor in scope. Each Faculty Council shall decide what \nconstitutes major SPA but all proposals to teach at another institution shall be considered major \nSPA. \nPage | 9 of                         MAR’10’2017 \nReporting Requirements \n8.

The annual statement may be made in conjunction with the annual report of the staff member or it \nmay be a separate statement. Each Faculty Council shall determine, from time to time, which is \nthe appropriate method for that Faculty. \n11. Each Faculty Council shall develop the format for the annual statement for that Faculty and \nsubmit to the Provost for approval. \n12. Decisions reached by a Faculty Council under this Article shall be conveyed, in writing, to the \nProvost and the Association. \nFaculty Regulations \n13. Each Faculty Council shall develop regulations with respect to SPA.  The regulations and any \namendments thereto shall be filed with the Provost and the Association. The regulations shall \ninclude: \na) The definition of what constitutes major SPA. \nb) The format for the annual statement of SPA; the determination of the time period covered \nby the report;  the date by which the report is to be submitted and whether the annual \nstatement about SPA shall be included in the annual report. \nc) Any modifications to the requirement that SPA be taken into account in the evaluation of a \nstaff member’s performance. \nd) Whether the time of year, week or day when SPA is performed is important to its approval \nand reporting. \ne) Whether the annual statement shall include information about remuneration received from \nSPA. \nf) Regulations governing the use of University facilities and staff for SPA including \narrangements to reimburse the University for such use. \ng) What evidence shall be required to ensure the staff member has adequate personal liability \ninsurance to indemnify the University against any claims. \nh) Such additional terms and conditions the Faculty Council may consider necessary; such \nterms and conditions shall be in addition to and not in contradiction to this Appendix. \nPage | 10 of                         MAR’10’2017 \nAPPENDIX E: \nSALARY SCHEDULE \n[Link] \nBENEFITS SCHEDULE \n[Link] \nREMOVAL GRANT REGULATIONS \n[Link] \nAPPENDIX F: \nCOPYRIGHT REGULATIONS (2016) \n1. Ownership \n1.1 Pursuant to 24.2 of the Agreement, a staff member who creates a Work resulting from or \nconnected with the staff member’s duties or employment owns copyright in the Work.  \nHowever, the University owns or has an interest in Works as provided in 1.4 to 1.7 inclusive, \n2.1 to 2.10 inclusive, 3.1, 5.1, and 5.2 of this Appendix. \n1.2 For the purposes of this Appendix and Article 24 of the Agreement, “Work” or “Works” means \nanything in which copyright subsists pursuant to the Copyright Act (Canada), whether \npublished or unpublished. For greater certainty, Work includes: architectural works, artistic \nworks, choreographic works, cinematographic works, collective works, dramatic works, literary \nworks, musical works, compilations, performers’ performances, sound recordings and \ncommunication signals, all as defined in the Copyright Act (Canada). \n1.3 A creator has moral rights in a Work, as provided under the Copyright Act. The Parties endorse \nand support the creator’s right to manage those moral rights. \n1.4 If a staff member creates a Work \n(a) in the course of performing administrative or management duties or activities for the \nUniversity, a Department, or a Faculty, including all units therein associated (e.g., \nCentres and Institutes); or \n(b) for the purposes of a committee or group of a Department, Faculty, or the University; \nthen the University owns copyright in the Work. \n1.5 If a staff member creates a Work pursuant to a written agreement between the staff member \nand the University, that agreement shall address the University’s arrangement with the staff \nmember regarding ownership or other interest in that Work.  \n1.6 If a staff member creates a Work under a sponsored research funding agreement with a third \nparty funder, copyright ownership and licensing are governed by the terms of the sponsored \nresearch funding agreement. Because the University shall enter into the sponsored research \nfunding agreement with the sponsor, the University has the right to obtain from the staff \nmember an assignment or licence of the copyright as necessary to fulfill its obligations to the \nsponsor under the sponsored research funding agreement.  However, the staff member cannot \nPage | 11 of                         MAR’10’2017 \nunilaterally assign or licence Works that are not wholly owned or created by that staff \nmember. \n1.7       If a staff member creates a Work under any other agreement between the University and a \nthird party, including but not limited to a secondment agreement or facility access agreement, \ncopyright ownership and licensing are governed by the terms of the agreement between the \nUniversity and the third party. To avoid any need for the staff member personally to transfer \nor agree to transfer rights relating to the Work to the third party (which may entail the \npersonal liability of the staff member), the University has the right to obtain from the staff \nmember an assignment or licence of the copyright as necessary to fulfill its obligations to the \nthird party under the agreement. However, the staff member cannot unilaterally assign or \nlicence Works that are not wholly owned or created by that staff member. \n2 University Licence  \nGeneral Principles \n2.1   Subject to 2.2 to 2.10 inclusive, the University is and shall be entitled to an immediate, non-\nexclusive, royalty-free, non-transferable, irrevocable licence to use any Work created or \nproduced by a staff member that results from or is connected with the staff member’s duties \nor employment, for all purposes within the University’s approved mandate pursuant to the \nPost-Secondary Learning Act (Alberta). \n2.2   The purposes referred to in 2.1 include, but are not be limited to, unit accreditation, unit or \nUniversity marketing, and any not-for-profit activity.  \n2.3 The licence contemplated by 2.1 does not apply if, as a result of reasonable academic or \npedagogical publishing practice, a staff member must assign copyright to a Work to a third \nparty as a condition of publication. In such a case, the staff member shall make best efforts to \ncause the third party to provide a licence to the University in relation to the Work, such licence \ncontaining terms that are analogous to those described in 2.1. \n2.4   The licence contemplated by 2.1 does not preclude a staff member from agreeing with the \nUniversity to grant any additional licence or other rights in and to a Work to the University.  \n2.5 A staff member, reasonably believing that his or her Work is unsatisfactory for a proposed use \ndue to outdating, incompleteness, negative impact on the professional reputation of the staff \nmember, or other academic grounds, may amend the Work or require that its use be withheld. \nLimited Exception – Works Created to Fulfill Assigned Course Responsibilities \n2.6 Except in the cases described in 2.7 to 2.10 inclusive, the licence contemplated by 2.1 does not \napply to any Work created by a staff member to fulfill assigned course responsibilities under \nArticles 8.01 and 8.03 of the Agreement. \n2.7   The licence contemplated by 2.1 includes those elements of a course outline that set out the \ninformation required by General Faculties Council policy, as described in the University \nCalendar. \n2.8 If a staff member is unable or unavailable to deliver all or part of a course duly assigned to that \nstaff member, the University may use the Work described in 2.6 to complete the delivery of \nPage | 12 of                         MAR’10’2017 \nthe course. Such a licence will not be irrevocable, but instead will be for the duration of the \ncourse in that academic year. \n2.9   The University may use a Work described in 2.6 for the purposes of unit accreditation, in \nconnection with transfer credit determinations or as the University may be required to meet \nits obligations to students. \n2.10 If a staff member is assigned course responsibilities under Article 8.03 of the Agreement that \nentail the preparation of course materials for use in multiple courses or courses taught in \nmultiple sections, the licence contemplated by 2.1 applies to those materials for a term of \nthree (3) years from the date that the materials are last revised by the staff member and it \nshall not be an interference in the creator’s moral rights for the University to modify the \ncourse materials as required for the purpose of keeping them current. \n3. Computer Programs and the University Patent Policy \n3.1 In addition to this Appendix, the University Patent Policy shall apply to a computer program \nthat is patentable intellectual property. \n4.  Conflict of Interest and Conflict of Commitment \n4.1 The University has an interest in ensuring that Works created by its own staff members are not \nused to compete with or undermine the University’s educational mission or activities. \nTherefore, a staff member's creation and use of Works in which the staff member owns \ncopyright remain subject to the University's conflict of interest and conflict of commitment \npolicies. \n5. Collaborative Works \n5.1 Works created collaboratively by students, staff, faculty and/or others present special \nchallenges with regard to copyright. Such works may be owned in whole or in part by the \nUniversity, or the University may have rights in and to those Works if they fall within one of the \ncategories described in 1.4 to 1.7 inclusive, 2.1 to 2.10 inclusive, or 3.1 of this Appendix.  \n5.2 Subject to 1.4 to 1.7 inclusive, 2.1 to 2.10 inclusive, or 3.1 of this Appendix, if a Work is created \nby a staff member and one or more other individuals governed by University collective \nagreements, policies, and procedures, as between the University and that staff member and \nthe individual or individuals, each person’s rights and obligations relating to the Work shall be \ndetermined by the applicable University collective agreements, policies, and procedures. In the \ncase of some collaborative Works, especially those involving members of different categories \nof persons within the University community, the parties involved may decide to assign \ncopyright to the University in order to coordinate distribution, use, and (when appropriate) \nrevenue sharing. \n5.3 If a Work is created by a staff member and an individual or individuals who are not subject to \nUniversity collective agreements, policies, and procedures, ownership of copyright will be \ndecided in accordance with: \n(a)   a written agreement between that staff member and that individual or those individuals;  \n(b)  a written agreement between the University and another organization; or \nPage | 13 of                         MAR’10’2017 \n(c) in the absence of an agreement contemplated by (a) or (b), in accordance with the \ngeneral law, except that this Appendix will apply to any interest held by the staff \nmember, with the necessary changes. \n6, Guidelines \n6.1 The University may publish guidelines, recommendations, and explanatory notes which shall \nnot form part of this Appendix, to assist staff members and others to structure collaborations \nin ways that maximize certainty and minimize conflicts respecting interests in Works, and to \nassist in the application or use of this Appendix. \nAPPENDIX G: \nPATENT POLICY \nPage | 14 of                         MAR’10’2017 \n1.

Any consideration not received in cash shall be valued \nby agreement between the University and the Inventor, failing which the value shall be \ndetermined by arbitration. \n“ROI” means a Report of Invention, in form available from the Director. \n3. Copyright \nThis Policy does not apply to copyrights on work published or unpublished, or to computer \nprograms (software) except as noted in the definition of the Invention. \n4. Plant Cultivars and Germ Plasm \nThe sharing of revenue earned from the registration and subsequent licensing, as appropriate, of \nplant cultivars and germ plasm, and other questions arising from an application for a license shall \nbe determined in accordance with the principles of this Policy as if the same were an Invention. \n5. Inventions Covered \nThis Policy shall apply to all Inventions including those made under grants, sponsorships, \ncontracts or agreements approved by the University. The Policy shall not apply to Inventions \nmade by Inventors in the course of demonstrably private research unrelated to their University \nduties or in the course of their activities as consultants to outside bodies, when such research or \nactivities do not involve use of University facilities or resources. \n6. Administration of the Policy \nThe Director shall be responsible for the administration of this Policy. \n7. Patent Alternatives \n7.1 An Inventor who makes an Invention and wishes to apply for a patent may, except as \nprovided in Paragraph 10 of this Policy, do so as an individual independent of the \nUniversity, or may do so through the University, as set out in these procedures. \n7.2 Any Inventor who makes an Invention must submit to the Intellectual Property and \nContracts Office an ROI which contains a full description of the Invention. The Inventor \nPage | 15 of                         MAR’10’2017 \nmust complete the section indicating whether or not the Inventor wishes to proceed \nindependently of the University or wishes to proceed through the University. \n7.3 While the Inventor may file a caveat as an intended applicant for a patent under the Patent \nAct (Canada) as soon as the ROI is submitted to the Director, the Inventor shall not enter \ninto any commitments outside the University aimed at patenting, assigning  or licensing the \ninvention for thirty (30) calendar days after such submission. This will enable \nrepresentatives of the Intellectual Property and Contracts Office to discuss with the Inventor \nthe Invention and its proposed applications and commercialization. \n8. Application Through the University \n8.1 If the Inventor offers to assign the Invention to the University, the Inventors ROI shall be \nreviewed by the Patents and Licensing Committee (see Paragraph 14 below), which shall \ndecide whether to accept assignment of the Invention. \n8.2 If the University decides to accept the assignment, it shall then assume the responsibility \nfor obtaining patents, the negotiation of assignments or licenses, and the taking of \nwhatever other steps are deemed necessary by the University for the commercialization of \nthe Invention without cost to the Inventor. \n8.3 The Director shall consult with the Inventor on how best to facilitate public use and \ncommercial application of the Invention.  In general, patent applications will be filed only in \nCanada or the United States of America.  Thereafter the University will attempt to verify the \ncommercial opportunities for the Invention before deciding whether to file in additional \ncountries or to incur additional expenses. \n8.4 If the decision is not to accept the assignment, or if no decision is made by the Patents and \nLicensing Committee within four (4) months from the date of submission of the ROI, or such \nearlier or later time may be agreed upon by the University and the Inventor, the Inventor \nmay, by notifying the Director in writing, recover full ownership of the Invention and proceed \nat the Inventors own discretion and own expense, pursuant to Paragraph 9 but without the \nthirty (30) calendar day waiting period. \n8.5 The University shall remit to the Inventor not later than 15 June each year a statement \nreporting all relevant actions taken in respect of the Invention during the previous University \nfiscal year, such as the issue of a patent, the conclusion of a licensing agreement or the \nlike; and reporting further the name and places of all establishments using the Invention \nunder license; and reporting further all expenditures and income forming part of the \ncalculation of Net Income for that year.  The University shall also, not later than 15 June, \nremit to the Inventor a sum equal to 33-% of the  Ne t Income for the previous fiscal year. \n8.6 If at any time after having accepted assignment of an Invention, the University determines \nthat it is not feasible to continue the commercialization of an Invention, and it has not \noutstanding contractual license or assignment obligations to third parties with respect to the \nInvention, it may reassign the Invention and any patent, or patent application relating \nthereto, to the Inventor, in which instance the Invention shall be treated as an Invention of \nwhich the Patent and Licensing Committee has pursuant to paragraph 8.4 determined not \nto accept an assignment. \n9. Application Independently of University \n9.1 When permitted pursuant to Paragraph 7 or Paragraph 8.4, the Inventor may proceed \nindependently of the University, or arrange with any outside sponsor of the Inventors \nchoice, to obtain patents for the Invention, to negotiate licenses, and otherwise to take \nwhatever steps the Inventor deems necessary for the commercialization of the Invention.  \nAll such steps shall be taken at the Inventor’s, or the Inventor’s sponsors expense. \nPage | 16 of                         MAR’10’2017 \n9.2 The University acknowledges that the Invention shall be owned by the Inventor and, except \nfor the obligations set forth in paragraph 9.3 below, the University shall have no other rights \nin respect of such Invention. \n9.3 The continuing obligations of the Inventor under this option shall be: \na) to provide the University with an annual statement, not later than 15 June of each \nyear, containing the information set out in paragraph 8.5 above; \nb) to maintain in Alberta proper records of the matters referred to in a) above and to \npermit the University access to the records for each year for a period of twenty-four \n(24) months following completion of that year. \nc) to remit to the University, with the annual statement, the sum equal to 33 1/3% of the \nNet Income for the previous fiscal year. \n10. Compulsory Application Through the University for Multi-Inventors \nIf more than one Inventor is involved in making an Invention, and if there is no other agreement \nbetween the Inventors, the Invention must be offered for patenting and commercialization through \nthe University, as contemplated in Paragraph 8.  In cases involving multi-Inventors, the Patent \nand Licensing Committee, after consultation with the Inventors, shall approve the list of Inventors \nand shall determine the relative royalty apportionment for the individuals concerned.  This level of \napportionment will be commensurate with the level of contribution of each.  If the Inventors wish \nto appeal the decision of the Committee in respect to the list of Inventors or to the royalty \napportionment, the procedures set out in section 14.3 shall apply. \n11. Variation to Net Income Apportionment \nNotwithstanding any provision of paragraphs 8 or 9 of this Policy, the University and the Inventor \nmay, with respect to an Invention, enter into an agreement in which responsibility for, and cost of, \npatenting and commercializing such Invention are dealt with in a manner different than provided \nin such paragraphs and in which Net Income is apportioned in a manner different from that \nprovided in these sections. \n12. Review of Patent Policy \nThe Patent Policy will be reviewed at least every five (5) years by the Patents and Licensing \nCommittee to keep it abreast of the needs of the University.  The review date will be based on the \ndate of the Policy coming into force. \n13. Assigned Inventions and Patents \nCertain contracts, grants, sponsorships and research agreements which have been or will be \nentered into by the University, on its behalf or on behalf of certain of its members, with industrial \ncompanies, government agencies and other bodies, may contain provisions in respect of \nInventions and patents, whereby all patent rights are assigned or licensed to such companies, \nagencies and other bodies or assigned to the University and licensed to such companies, \nagencies and other bodies, and may contain provisions which are at variance with the provisions \nof this Policy.  The provisions of such contracts, grants, sponsorships and research agreements \nshall supersede the other provisions of this Policy. The University retains the right to enter into \nsuch agreements, and requires that University members comply with such provisions in contracts, \ngrants, sponsorships, or research agreements. \n14. Patents and Licensing Committee (Terms of Reference Attached) \n14.1 The Patents and Licensing Committee shall consist of the Associate Vice-President \n(Research), the Director, one person appointed by the University Research Policy \nCommittee, one person appointed by the AAS:UA, and one person appointed by the \nPage | 17 of                         MAR’10’2017 \nAdvisory Committee of the Office of Intellectual Property and Contracts. The Committee \nchooses its own Chair. \n14.2 In the event that a meeting of the Patents and Licensing Committee or its executive is held \nto make a decision respecting a particular ROI, as referred to in Paragraph 8.1 of this \npolicy, the Inventor and the Inventor’s Dean and Department Chair will be invited to attend \nthe meeting and will have the opportunity to state their views. \n14.3 If an Inventor or group of Inventors decides to appeal a decision of the Patents and \nLicensing Committee, the appeal shall be heard by a one person arbitration board, the \narbitrator being chosen by the Provost. \n14.4 If two parties in a Multi-Inventor patent dispute the relative apportionment of royalties, the \ndispute shall be heard by a three person arbitration board.  Each party shall select a \nrepresentative to the board and those two persons shall select a third person to chair the \nboard.  Where the two representatives cannot agree on a third person, the third person \nshall be chosen by the Provost. \n15. Commitment to University Research \nA portion of Net Income shall be used to support research at the University, with special \nrecognition being given to the Faculty, Department, or the laboratory in which the Invention \noriginated.  The University will commit a portion of its Net Income to this end and encourages \nUniversity Inventors to do the same. \nPage | 18 of                         MAR’10’2017 \nAPPENDIX H: \nDetailed Procedures on Evaluation and Promotion \n[to be developed in accordance with Appendix I] \nPage | 19 of                         MAR’10’2017 \nAPPENDIX I: \nINTERPRETATION AND TRANSITION \nThe parties agree that: \n1.

The Faculty must continue to ensure internal equity is \nmaintained. Details of the variation from the Agreement should be included in the special \nconditions section of the appointment letter and approved by the Office of the Provost.   \n8.
