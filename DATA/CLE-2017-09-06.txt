She noted that the proposal included a separation of required and optional items for the course outline. A member raised concerns about the proposed addition of learning outcomes to course outlines. Members discussed learning outcomes and provided comments on academic freedom, resources for faculty to develop statements of learning outcomes and ways to plan how the course fits in with their long term program outcomes. Further discussion on learning outcomes involved how they could be used to inform students and be useful in course re-design and program level planning. A member reported that the Moodle syllabus and mapping tool had been implemented in their Faculty and noted that supports were put in place to assist faculty by converting current course outlines to the new system and that this helped with the uptake. Members also discussed tentative course schedules and expressed concerns over the loss of flexibility to adapt course schedules, while others expressed concerns around allowing students a timeline to plan in terms of mental health. With respect to the course outline, it was suggested that the list of student supports be expanded to include details of the Dean of Students and those offered by the students’ union.",

She indicated that the report of the ad hoc Committee on Academic Governance \nIncluding Delegated Authority was approved by GFC on April 21 and that a number of the recommendations are \napplicable to CLE and will form part of the committee’s work in the coming months. \nThe Chair thanked Janice Miller-Young, Jeff Rawlings, Mani Vaidyanathan and Stanley Varnhagen for their \nefforts since the last meeting to pull together the recommendations for the USRI item on the agenda. \nFinally, the Chair congratulated Gerald Beasley, University Librarian, and his team on the signing of the MOU \nwith the National Centre for Truth and Reconciliation.  \nACTION ITEMS \n4. Report of the GFC Committee on Learning Environment on Teaching and Learning and Teaching \nEvaluation and the Use of the Universal Student Ratings of Instruction (USRI) as an Evaluation Tool  \nMaterials before members are contained in the official meeting file. \nPresenter(s): Sarah Forgie \nDiscussion:  \nThe Chair provided an overview of the documents and noted that the recommendations would inform the \nworkplan of the committee over the next year. The committee provided comments on a number of sections \nincluding the importance of student input, increasing response rates, and tools to evaluate small classes. A \nmember noted that evaluation of research faces many of the same challenges as teaching evaluation. The \ncommittee discussed some of the wording in the report and provided some refinements to that wording.

Dr Forgie noted \nthat a report will be produced after the retreat. \nGFC Committee on the Learning Environment 04/26/2017 \nPage 3 \n6. e-USRI Response Rate Update  \nPresenter(s): Jeff Rawlings; Adam Giraldeau \nPurpose of the Proposal: For information/discussion. \nDiscussion:  \nThe committee discussed response rates for e-USRIs including the number of days allowed for students to \nrespond and a potential standardization of the process across the university, for example, requiring class time to \nbe given for students to complete the USRI. Mr Rawlings noted that a number of variables influence the \nresponse rate including holidays in the midst of the process. Further discussion occurred regarding how to flag \npoor response rates, the need for multifaceted evaluation, ensuring that FEC is aware of the quality of the data, \nand education to adequately understand the data produced.  \nMr Rawlings noted that the process had been changed so that students received one email with all of their links \nrather than separate emails; the committee asked if further detail on whether students were selective in which \nlinks were followed could be provided.  \nMr Rawlings will continue to report on the response rates, and further changes that are implemented with the \ninput of CLE. \n7. Open Educational Resources  \nPresenter(s): Gerald Beasley \nMr Beasley spoke about the leadership by UBC at the recent Open Education (OE) Week at UBC. He noted the \nOE repository and resources and how they were used in faculty evaluation processes including promotion and \ntenure.

Comments from the Chair  \nThe Chair thanked outgoing members for their service to the committee and welcomed new members. \nGFC Committee on the Learning Environment 06/07/2017 \nPage 2 \nDISCUSSION ITEMS \n4. Learning Outcomes Retreat - Update  \nPresenter(s): Sarah Forgie \nThere were no documents. \nThe Chair provided the committee with an update on the May 2 retreat, a joint venture between the Provost’s \nOffice, the Centre for Teaching and Learning (CTL), and the Faculty of Graduate Studies and Research (FGSR).  \nShe noted that the focus of the retreat was to socialize the goal of learning outcomes. Attendance at the retreat \nincluded Deans/delegates, Associate Deans and representatives from the Campus Alberta Quality Council \n(CAQC); the material was well received by the approximately 40 participants. The retreat included a \npresentation on the role of learning outcomes, and panel discussions on implementing and assessing learning \noutcomes. A brief report with a high level summary will be compiled. Follow up sessions will include more \nconcrete examples or case studies. In addition, workshops will be available through CTL. Parallel work will occur \non graduate student learning outcomes specific to course based and thesis based masters, and PhDs; these will \nbe advertised on the CTL website. \n5. Provost’s Teaching Awards  \nPresenter(s): Sarah Forgie \nThere were no documents. \nThe Chair reported that she had spoken with the Deans about the decline in applications for teaching awards \nincluding the University Teaching Awards, Provost’s teaching awards, and outside awards like the 3M. She \nasked the committee for ideas on how to celebrate exceptional teachers and increase the number of names \ncoming forward for these awards. \nDuring the discussion, members noted the following challenges and opportunities: the amount of work required \nto develop an application and the suggestion that some tangible assistance, perhaps centrally, was required; \nawards are not widely known; every Faculty should be encouraged to put forward nominees for these awards; \nfaculty should be given credit by their Faculty for the time and effort spent developing applications; the role of \nVice-Deans or subcommittees at the Faculty level in putting forward nominees; and equity concerns. In the \ndiscussion of how to increase the number of applicants, members suggested mentorship, workshops, a change \nof culture around nominations, and having a mechanism in place to tap shoulders or potential applicants to \nencourage them to apply.  \n6. Report and Recommendations of the ad hoc Committee on Academic Governance Including Delegated \nAuthority with respect to the GFC Committee on the Learning Environment  \nPresenter(s): Sarah Forgie; Meg Brolley \nMs Brolley, GFC Secretary and Manager of GFC Services, provided members with an overview of the \nfoundational documents approved by GFC related to the role and responsibilities or members, committee \ncomposition, delegations of authority and procedural rules. She noted that the proposed revisions to the \ncommittee terms of reference include improved alignment with GFC through membership, an improved, \nstandardized template for the terms of reference across all of GFC’s standing committees, and more clearly \ndefined committee responsibilities. Additionally, the report recognized that CLE will need to do further work on \nthe draft terms before they are ready for GFC approval, and encouraged the committee to do so. \nMembers discussed the recommendations of the ad hoc committee noting that it represented a welcome shift in \nacademic governance. A member noted that Learning Services exists between learning and research and \nGFC Committee on the Learning Environment 06/07/2017 \nPage 3 \nraised the question of how it would exist between a newly named ARPC (Academic and Research Planning \nCommittee) and CLE. The committee raised the following points: there is a lack of forum for items such as the \nebook preferred policy; CLE has a role in identifying and disseminating best practice; the learning environment \nand teaching environment parts of the committee’s areas of responsibility cross portfolios; there is no \nrepresentative on the committee from Facilities and Operations; and that there should be a clear understanding \nof the division between operations and governance. A member suggested the formation of a working group to \nfocus on the terms of reference. \nThe Chair noted that this would be an ongoing discussion at the committee over the next year. \n7. Question Period  \nThere were no questions. \nINFORMATION REPORTS \n8. Items Approved by the Committee by E-Mail Ballots (non-debatable)  \nThere were no items. \n9.

It is important to \nrecognize that committee orientation must be designed in light of the \nfact that those at-large members who do not sit on GFC may require \nadditional attention. The ad hoc committee recommends that \nItem No. 8 \nGFC COMMITTEE ON THE LEARNING ENVIRONMENT \nFor the Meeting of September 6, 2017 \n orientation and orientation materials should be provided in a number \nof modes and formats, including stand-alone orientation workshops, \nbriefings at meetings, and through widely available written and online \nmaterials. A GFC member handbook or guidebook would be an ideal \nreference tool. In light of the unique character of collegial academic \ngovernance, GFC members should be encouraged to use orientation \nsessions to meet and get to know their fellow members and create \nnetworks which can provide informal support and community building \nopportunities. The following recommendations focus on improving \norientation to prepare GFC and committee members to be informed \nand active participants in academic governance. \nRecommendation: THAT a variety of orientation sessions be offered \nincluding a general orientation to governance (Governance 101), \nfollowed by orientations more specific to GFC and GFC standing \ncommittees, and follow up sessions through the year \nRecommendation: THAT the responsibilities of members be clearly \noutlined in a core GFC document” \nCompliance with Legislation, \nPolicy and/or Procedure \nRelevant to the Proposal \n(please quote legislation and \ninclude identifying section \nnumbers) \n1.

Current Committee Terms of Reference \nPrepared by: University Governance \n1 of 2 \nGENERAL FACULTIES COUNCIL \nPrinciples of Delegation \nPrinciples for General Faculties Council Delegation of Authority \nIntroduction \nGovernance is understood as the process through which an organization defines and achieves \nits mandate, which includes making decisions with regard to the structures, policies, and \npractices of decision-making; the exercise of authority; and the mechanisms of accountability.  \nGeneral Faculties Council (GFC) has employed a structure that relies upon the delegation of its \nprovincially-mandated authorities to its standing committees, individuals on campus and other \ncampus bodies.  Delegation is essential to ensure timely and efficient decision-making in \nsmaller forums with access to appropriate resource people, while allowing GFC to focus on \nsubstantive and strategic issues of broad relevance to the university community.  The following \noffers guidance to this delegation structure and helps maintain accountability, transparency, and \ncollegiality in the academic governance system at the University of Alberta. \nRetained Authority \nGeneral Faculties Council shall pursue major policy and strategic issues that include: \n● significant strategic and policy issues related to the academic affairs of the university;\n● any matter involving the alteration of the mandate, terms of reference, membership, or\nstructure of a GFC standing committee; and\n● those matters that a standing committee, body, or officer holding delegated authority\nfrom GFC considers to be of major strategic significance or long-term impact on the\nuniversity.\nPrinciples \n1. Delegations of authority must be reasonable in scope and appropriate to the character and\ncapacity of the body (e.g. council or committee) or officer receiving the delegated authority. \n2. An officer or body acting with delegated authority is accountable to the body which\ndelegated the authority and must report to that body in a timely and sufficiently detailed\nfashion on actions taken under the delegated authority.\n3. An officer or body is responsible to be alert to situations where, for example, there is\nuncertainty as to whether an item falls within the intended delegation or the significance of\nan issue and the division of opinion on the issue suggest it is prudent to refer the issue or\ndecision to the delegating body for consideration. When there is uncertainty as to whether\nan item falls within the intended delegated authority, or if there is clear division of opinion,\nthe officer or body with delegated authority will refer the item to the body that delegated the\nauthority along with a recommendation.\n4. Delegations should be recorded in written form and curated in a transparent manner.\n2 of 2 \nGENERAL FACULTIES COUNCIL \nPrinciples of Delegation \n 5. A body delegating authority may impose restrictions on that authority -- including restrictions \non the authority to sub-delegate -- so long as the restrictions allow sufficient authority for the \ndelegation to be meaningful. \n6. All delegations of authority should be reviewed at regular intervals (ideally once every three \nyears) to ensure they remain appropriate. \n7. Withdrawal of delegated authority should be considered judiciously based on the best \ninterest of the institution and cannot be done retroactively. \n8. An officer or body is not compelled to exercise delegations. The fact that a delegation is held \ndoes not oblige the officer or body to exercise the delegation if, in the opinion of the \ndelegate, some special or unusual circumstances are involved which make it sensible that \nthe issue should receive consideration at a more senior level. \nApproved by General Faculties Council: April 21, 2017 \n1 of 1 \nGENERAL FACULTIES COUNCIL \nPrinciples of Committee Composition \nPrinciples for General Faculties Council Standing Committee Composition \nIntroduction \nGovernance at the University of Alberta relies upon a structure wherein the General Faculties \nCouncil has delegated many of its provincially-mandated authorities to its standing committees.  \nAs such, the composition of those standing committees is crucial to ensuring that decisions are \nmade in an informed manner that takes into account the breadth of issues, perspectives and \nopinions on campus.  The following principles provide a framework to create committee \ncompositions which are reflective of the membership of GFC and appropriate to the role and \nmandate of those committees.  \nPrinciples \n1. Wherever possible, the majority of elected members of each standing committee should be\ndrawn from the membership of GFC to provide tangible links between GFC and its standing\ncommittees and increase engagement of the greater GFC community.\n2. Wherever possible, the number of elected members of a standing committee should exceed\nthe number of ex-officio members.\n3. The voting status of ex-officio members of standing committees should be consistent with\ntheir voting status on GFC and should extend to their delegates.\n4. Ex-officio members should be included in the membership of a standing committee only\nwhen their portfolio is directly relevant to the mandate and role of the standing committee.\n5. Wherever possible, the Vice-Chair of a standing committee should be elected by the\ncommittee from its elected academic staff members and ideally be a member of GFC.\n6. Standing Committees should be populated with a commitment to diversity and broad\nrepresentation from across the university.\n7. When cross-appointment of members on standing committees is appropriate, this should be\noutlined in the terms of reference of each committee and such members shall have voting\nstatus on both committees.\nApproved by General Faculties Council: April 21, 2017 \n1 of 2 \nGENERAL FACULTIES COUNCIL \nRoles and Responsibilities of Members \nRoles and Responsibilities of Members \nIntroduction \nGeneral Faculties Council (GFC) is the principal academic decision-making body of the \nuniversity. It is established in the Post-Secondary Learning Act (PSLA) and given authority, \nsubject to the Board of Governors, over the academic affairs of the university. \nFor GFC to be successful in fulfilling its terms of reference and meeting its responsibilities to the \nuniversity it depends on the active engagement of its members. GFC has delegated much of its \nauthority for routine matters to standing committees allowing GFC to engage in high level \nstrategic and stewardship policy issues.

GFC rules are not meant to \nunduly restrict debate or limit opportunities for participation. Their purpose is to facilitate \ninclusive and respectful dialogue, while ensuring efficient decision-making. It is the responsibility \nof the Chair, with the support of GFC, to employ the rules governing general meetings in a \nmanner consistent with these principles. Substantive motions should be handled with \nconsiderable formality, but whenever possible the Chair should deal with matters of procedure \nby general agreement. \nThe following rules and procedures are based on a number of fundamental principles that \nencourage participation and engagement of members. These principles include: \n• A commitment to inclusive and participatory decision-making. \n• A commitment to openness, transparency and respectful communication. \n1.  Procedural Rules  \n1.1  GFC and its standing committees are governed by the procedural rules set out below. \nFor matters not covered by these rules, or by the Post Secondary Learning Act (PSLA) \nreference shall be made to the current edition of Robert's Rules of Order. If this does \nnot provide clear direction regarding a point in question, then the Chair shall decide \nhow to proceed. However, such rulings by the Chair may be overruled via a motion \nsupported by a vote of the majority of those present.  \n1.2  The chairs of GFC and its standing committees will be responsible for guiding \nmeetings of GFC and its standing committees, enforcing rules, and deciding questions \npertaining to those rules. Any decisions of the chair are subject to challenge (see \n10.3). \n1.3 The Chair will not participate actively in debate regarding a motion before GFC without \npassing the role of the Chair to the Vice-Chair for the duration of the debate and the \nsubsequent vote.  \n2. Meetings \n 2.1 GFC and its standing committees shall meet regularly during the academic year, the \nschedule of which will be published on the governance website at least one month \nbefore the beginning of each academic year. GFC meetings will not be scheduled \nduring the period set aside for final examinations or Reading Week, however \ncommittee meetings may occur during this time. \n 2.2 Cancellation - GFC Executive Committee may cancel a meeting of GFC if it \ndetermines that the number and nature of the agenda items make it reasonable to \ndefer consideration, and provided that notice of such cancellation is given to members \nat least one week prior to the date of the meeting. The Chair of a GFC standing \ncommittee may cancel a meeting if the agenda items make it reasonable to defer \n2 of 6 \nGENERAL FACULTIES COUNCIL \nMeeting Procedural Rules   \nconsideration, and provided that notice of such cancellation is given to members as \nearly as possible.  \n 2.3  From time to time, the Chair of GFC may call special meetings of GFC, provided that \nnotice of such meetings is given to members at least one month in advance.  \n 2.4 GFC meetings shall normally be scheduled and planned to end two hours after being \ncalled to order. \n 2.5 Debate on new items of business will not be entertained after GFC has been sitting for \nthree hours.  \n 2.6 No audio or video recording of meetings shall be permitted unless by express authority \nof the Chair. \n3. Open Sessions \n 3.1 Meetings of GFC and its standing committees are normally held in open session, with \nthe exception of those dealing with nominations and adjudication which are always \nheld in closed session. \n 3.2 Subject to the limitations of space and orderly conduct as determined by the chair, \nmembers of the university community and the general public may attend open \nmeetings as observers. Observers may only speak if expressly invited to do so by the \nChair.  \n4. Closed Sessions \n 4.1 From time to time, GFC or its committees may hold meetings or portions of meetings \nas closed meetings; at that point, proceedings will be confidential and all non-\nmembers, except those specifically invited, will be asked to withdraw. \n5.  Questions  \n5.1  If more information than is provided as part of the meeting agenda is required, \ninformation requests may be made of the University Governance office. \n5.2  Questions on an issue within GFC’s jurisdiction may be submitted in writing to the GFC \nSecretary up to six working days before the next GFC meeting to receive a written \nresponse. \n5.3  Every GFC meeting has Question Period as a standing item wherein members may \nraise a question during the time set aside for this item (see 6.5). Procedures for \nQuestion Period are available at governance.ualberta.ca \n5.4  Questions with regard to a specific item on an agenda may be raised during \nconsideration of that item at the GFC meeting. \n6.  Agendas \n 6.1  The agenda of each GFC meeting will be proposed by the GFC Executive Committee \nand approved by GFC. The GFC Executive Committee will ensure that items put \nbefore GFC are complete and ready for discussion and published in advance of the \nmeeting.  \nhttp://www.governance.ualberta.ca/GeneralFacultiesCouncil/%7E/media/Governance/Documents/GO05/GEN/Linked%20Documents%20on%20GFC%20Home%20Page/Question-Period-Excerpt-from-the-2006-GFC-PM.pdf\n3 of 6 \nGENERAL FACULTIES COUNCIL \nMeeting Procedural Rules   \n 6.2 If GFC members want to have an issue debated, they are asked to submit the issue to \nthe GFC Executive Committee. Whenever possible, members wishing to add items to \nthe agenda should contact the Chair or GFC Secretary two weeks in advance of the \nGFC Executive Committee meeting to allow time for the item to be added to the \nagenda. \n 6.3 Should a member wish to add an item to the agenda at a meeting of GFC, a two-thirds \nvote of those present is required; the Chair will then determine where the item appears \non the agenda. In cases where the Chair or GFC Secretary has been informed in \nadvance of a planned request to add a new item, but after the agenda has been \npublished, the proposal shall be circulated to members through the normal means. \n 6.4 When the Agenda is being approved, the Chair will entertain a request to change the \norder of items, for specified reasons.  \n 6.5 Each agenda of GFC and its standing committees will include Question Period of one \nhalf hour in length that may be extended with the approval of members.  \na. Question period is comprised of both written questions and, time permitting, \nquestions from the floor.   \nb. The Chair will rule on whether a question from the floor can be answered \nexpeditiously; if not, it will be referred to the appropriate officer for response at the \nnext meeting.  \n 6.6 Reports from standing committees are included on the GFC agenda for information \nonly. Questions may be asked for clarification, but no debate may take place on such \nitems. \n 6.7 Reports for Information may be moved to the discussion part of the agenda if a \nmember gives two days notice to the GFC Secretary to ensure that an appropriate \nperson is present to answer questions that may arise during discussion.  \n 6.8   Agendas and materials for open session meetings are posted at \ngovernance.ualberta.ca \n7. Quorum  \n 7.1 General Faculties Council -  The quorum for a GFC meeting is one-third of the total \nmembership, except in the months of May through August when the quorum shall be \none-quarter of the total membership.  \n 7.2 GFC Standing Committees – The quorum for standing committee meetings is one-half \nof the voting members or, in the case where this is an even number, one-half plus 1 \nmember.  \n 7.3 Vacancies on committees are not included when establishing quorum. \n 7.4 Maintaining quorum - A duly-called meeting which starts with a quorum present shall \nbe deemed to have a continuing quorum, notwithstanding the departure of voting \nmembers, unless the quorum is challenged by a voting member. In the event of a \nchallenge, the remaining members may choose to adjourn or continue the meeting. In \nhttp://www.governance.ualberta.ca/en/GeneralFacultiesCouncil.aspx\n4 of 6 \nGENERAL FACULTIES COUNCIL \nMeeting Procedural Rules   \nthe event of a decision to continue a meeting without quorum, the minutes shall record \nthis fact and any decisions taken must be ratified at the next meeting.  \n8. Motions \n 8.1 Normally, all motions concerning substantive matters shall be published in the agenda \nmaterials. \n 8.2 All motions must be moved and seconded by members of GFC.  Motions to appoint \nnew members may only be moved and seconded by statutory members of GFC. \n 8.3 Motions pass with a majority vote, except for the following: (1) motions to add an item \nto the agenda require a two-thirds majority of those present; (2) motions to rescind a \nmotion require a two-thirds majority of total members. \n 8.4 To make a motion, a member must be recognized by the Chair. (In the interest of \nclarity and to expedite business, it is advisable to provide a written motion to the GFC \nSecretary). The person making a motion will be invited by the Chair to speak first in \nany ensuing debate. \n 8.5 Amendments to Motions - A member may make a motion to amend the wording – \nand within certain limits the meaning – of a pending motion before the pending motion \nitself is voted upon. The amendment must be germane and cannot be used to \nintroduce a new subject. An amendment is debatable. \n 8.6 Motion to Adjourn - A motion to adjourn is a motion to close the meeting. It must be \nseconded, is not debatable or amendable, and typically requires a simple majority \nvote. During the months of March and April, motions to adjourn require a two-thirds \nmajority if substantive items of business remain on the agenda.  \n 8.7 During the course of a GFC meeting, members may make a Notice of Motion for \ndebate at the next GFC meeting. In such cases GFC Executive will be responsible for \nplacement of the motion on the next GFC agenda. \n9. Motions for Specific Purposes \n 9.1 Motion to Table – Enables the pending question to be laid aside until some future \ntime. The motion cannot be debated. The mover may make a statement regarding \nwhat information they believe would be required to remove the item from the table, and \nthe proposer of the item may make a brief comment on the impact of tabling the \nmotion.  \n 9.2 Motion to Take From the Table – Brings the motion back before GFC and cannot be \ndebated. \n. \n 9.3 Motion to Reconsider an item which was voted upon at the current or the last \nmeeting. If passed, proceedings are restored to the point immediately prior to the vote \nto which it applies. \n 9.4 Motion to Rescind a Motion is only used when a Motion to Reconsider is out of time. \nMotions to Rescind require support of two-thirds of the total membership if no Notice of \nMotion was given, but only a simple majority if Notice was given.  \n5 of 6 \nGENERAL FACULTIES COUNCIL \nMeeting Procedural Rules   \n10. Debate \n 10.1  Normally, a member may not speak for a second time until the Chair is satisfied that all \nmembers wishing to speak for their first time have done so. \n 10.2  A member who has the floor may not normally be interrupted. However, the Chair may \ninterrupt a speaker if the speaker is out of order by using unacceptable language, is \nabusive of other members, or is not speaking to the motion. If the Chair does not do \nso, a member may raise this as a point of order.  \n 10.3  Point of Order - It is the right of any member who notices a breach of the rules of \nCouncil to insist on their enforcement. If the Chair fails to notice such a breach, any \nmember may make the appropriate Point of Order, calling on the Chair for a ruling. A \nPoint of Order does not require a seconder, it is not debatable or amendable, and \ncannot be reconsidered.  \n 10.4  Calling the Question - Upon hearing a member call the question, the Chair will ask \nmembers if they are ready to vote on the motion being discussed. If there appears to \nbe opposition to closing the debate, the Chair may ask for a motion to close debate. If \nseconded, members will then vote on this motion and proceed accordingly.  \n11. Debates without Motions \n11.1  When discussion of an issue and the formal rules pertaining to making motions, \ndebate, and voting seem to be a hindrance to thoughtful discussion, the GFC agenda \ncan allow for a less structured discussion guided by the Chair and the consensus of \nthe members in attendance.  \n12. Attendance  \n 12.1 Delegates – members who serve on GFC or its standing committees by virtue of their \noffice may send a delegate; such delegates shall act with all the rights of membership.  \nThere shall be no alternates for other members. \n 12.2 GFC attendance - If a student misses two consecutive meetings or more than three \nmeetings, the Students’ Union or the Graduate Students’ Association may request that \nthe Chair declare the position vacant. If a faculty representative or a non-student \nappointed member misses two consecutive meetings or more than three meetings in \none academic year without a reason satisfactory to the members of the GFC Executive \nCommittee, the Executive Committee may declare the position vacant.  \n 12.3 Standing committee attendance - If an elected member is absent from three \nconsecutive meetings or is frequently absent without a reason satisfactory to the \nremaining members of the Committee, the Chair shall declare the position vacant.  \n13. Voting  \n 13.1 All members of GFC are charged with the responsibility of examining issues before \nCouncil and voting as they judge fit on such issues. No member of GFC, regardless of \nhow that person gains membership on Council, is an instructed delegate. \n 13.2 Motions shall normally be adopted on a simple majority of members present except to \nadd items to the agenda which requires a two-thirds majority of those present, or for a \nMotion to Rescind which requires a two-thirds majority vote of total membership. \n6 of 6 \nGENERAL FACULTIES COUNCIL \nMeeting Procedural Rules   \n 13.3  An abstention is not considered to be a vote cast.  \n 13.4 The Chair votes only in the instance of a tie. When there is a tie vote, the motion is lost \nif the Chair abstains.  \n 13.5 All members may participate in discussions; only voting members may move, second \nand vote on motions.  \n 13.6 Electronic Votes by Committees – In cases where extensive deliberation is not \nessential to determining a course of action and it is necessary for a business item to \nbe decided before the next scheduled meeting, the Chair and Secretary of a GFC \nstanding committee may hold an electronic vote. The motion will be duly moved and \nseconded and all normal procedures will be followed in conducting the e-mail ballot. \nHowever, upon receiving the item of business and ballot, any committee member may \nrequest that the matter be debated at the next meeting or at a special meeting and the \nvote delayed until after that debate, with the Chair determining the appropriate course \nof action.  \n 13.7 Electronic Votes by GFC – In cases where GFC is the electing body to populate \ncertain selection committees and other bodies, the election process may use e-vote \nmechanisms. \n 13.8 Electronic Approval of Committee Reports by GFC – Reports from the Nominating and \nReplenishment Committees may be distributed electronically to GFC members and are \nconsidered approved by the deadlines indicated on the report subject to receipt of \nadditional nominations.   \n14. Records of Proceedings \n 14.1 Official Record – The official record of meetings of GFC shall be the minutes taken by \nthe Secretary and approved by GFC. \n 14.2 Minutes – The minutes shall reflect the decisions made and reasons for the decision.  \n15. Amendment of these Rules and Procedures \nRules and procedures governing meetings of General Faculties Council may be amended \nby a majority vote of those present and voting at a duly constituted meeting of GFC, \nprovided that notice of the proposed amendment has been given and that a quorum is \npresent at the time the vote is taken.

Such changes \nshall only occur with fair warning or general \nclass consent. \nStudents concerned about the application of \nthese guidelines should consult, in turn, the \ninstructor, the chair of the department by \nwhich the course is offered, and the dean of \nthe faculty in which the course is offered. \nAt the beginning of each course, instructors \nare required by GFC to provide a course \noutline to students and their Department (or \nFaculty in non-Departmentalized Faculties) \nthat includes the following: \n1. a statement of the course objectives \nand general content \n2. a list of the required textbooks and \nother major course materials \n3. a list of any other course fees as \ndescribed in the 'Student Instructional \nSupport Fees Policy' and their \nassociated costs \n4. an indication of how and when \nstudents have access to the instructor \n5. the distribution of weight between \nterm work and final examination \n6. the relative weight of all term work \ncontributing to the course grade \n Evaluation Procedures and Grading \nSystem  \n(2) Course Requirements, Evaluation \nProcedures and Grading:  \nAt the beginning of each course, instructors \nare required to provide a course outline to \nstudents and their Department (or Faculty in \nnon-Departmentalized Faculties).
