Discussion: Dr Costopoulos reported that this Policy reflects an institutional commitment to education, awareness, response and due process to sexual violence at the University of Alberta. He pointed out adjustments made to the definitions of the Policy based on feedback provided by members of the Committee. During the discussion, Dr Costopoulos confirmed that although this Policy may inform the way some provisions of other institution policies are applied, it does not modify them. Members also discussed the measures meant to inform the community about the definition of distribution of intimate images, and Ms Eerkes reported that a working group has been established to evaluate this. The Chair thanked presenters for their work on this proposal.",

The Policy suite includes key definitions to educate all \nmembers of the university community.   Fundamental principles \nestablished in the policy suite include the importance of believing \nsurvivors when they disclose an experience of sexual violence and \nproviding support, accommodations, interim measures, and information \non filing a formal complaint.  \nIn addition, the proposed policy indicates “The University takes seriously \nits responsibility to reduce sexual violence by fostering a culture of \nconsent and support through education, training and policy.”  The impact \nwill be an increasingly educated and informed community that can better \nhandle disclosures and complaints of sexual violence. \nThe Government of Alberta has made it clear that they expect every \ninstitution to produce a stand-alone policy on sexual violence.  \nReplaces/Revises (eg, policies, \nresolutions) \nN/A \nTimeline/Implementation Date Upon final approval \nEstimated Cost and funding \nsource \nN/A \nNext Steps (ie.: \nCommunications Plan, \nImplementation plans) \nThe University’s central Marketing and Communications office will \ndevelop and execute a communications strategy to inform the campus \nand broader communities.

Those four working groups include: Support, \nAssessment, Education and Outreach, and Accountability.

Overview \na.  Sexual violence is a complex and serious problem in society and on university campuses. Sexual \nviolence can affect individuals of all gender identities, gender expressions, and sexual orientations, as \nwell as those from all ages, abilities, racial, cultural and economic backgrounds. \nb. The University recognizes the harm caused by a culture in which common attitudes, norms and practices \ntolerate, normalize, trivialize, excuse or outright condone sexual violence. Sometimes called rape culture, \nit is perpetuated through images, television, music, jokes, advertising, jargon, words and figures of \nspeech that normalize sexual coercion and shift blame onto those who have experienced sexual violence. \nAs an institution that exists in the context of that culture, the University takes seriously its responsibility to \nreduce sexual violence by fostering a culture of consent and support through education, training and \npolicy. \nc. This policy is guided by the following principles: \ni. the need for safety in the work, study and student residence environment, providing a community \nin which sexual violence is not tolerated, \nii. the inherent dignity of all members of the University community, \niii. the importance of fostering a culture of consent and support through education, training and \npolicy initiatives, \niv. the need to identify and dismantle barriers to making a disclosure and/or complaint,  \nv. access to support for anyone in the University community who discloses that they have \nexperienced or been affected by sexual violence, and \nvi. procedural fairness and support for the parties to formal complaint processes related to sexual \nviolence. \n2. Purpose \nThe purpose of this policy is to state the University’s commitment to addressing sexual violence through \neducation and awareness, providing access to comprehensive support for those who have experienced or \nbeen affected by sexual violence and implementing transparent and fair processes to resolve and adjudicate \ncomplaints of sexual violence. \n  U of A Policies and Procedures On-Line (UAPPOL) \n3. POLICY \na.  It is the policy of the University of Alberta that sexual violence committed by any member of the University \ncommunity is prohibited and constitutes misconduct. Prohibited conduct includes: sexual violence, sexual \nassault, sexual harassment, stalking, indecent exposure, voyeurism, and distribution of intimate \nimages.  \nb. Any member of the University community who discloses having experienced sexual violence will have \naccess to support, whether or not the sexual violence took place on University property or in relation to \nUniversity activities. Where the University has jurisdiction, complaints will be addressed under the \napplicable policies or procedures, including, for example, the Code of Student Behaviour, the \nPostdoctoral Fellow Policy, NASA, AASUA or GSA collective agreements, or other applicable \nemployment contracts and agreements. \n4. COMMITMENT TO THOSE WHO HAVE EXPERIENCED SEXUAL VIOLENCE \na. Sexual violence can have serious and enduring negative effects on physical, mental, emotional and \nspiritual health and wellness. The University recognizes the possible effects of trauma on those who have \nexperienced sexual violence and supports the efforts of individuals to seek support and recover. \nRegardless of where or when it took place, any person who discloses and/or makes a complaint of sexual \nviolence can expect to be: \ni. treated with respect, dignity and compassion, \nii. informed about on- and off-campus resources and supports, \niii. provided with access to support which is non-judgmental, coordinated and comprehensive  \niv. offered options for academic, recreational, University residence and/or workplace modifications \nto prevent further unwanted contact with the subject of the disclosure and ameliorate, to the \nextent possible, the negative impacts of the sexual violence on the person’s working, study or \nstudent residence environment, \nv. provided with information about available complaint processes should they wish to pursue a \ncomplaint within the University and/or to an external law enforcement agency, and  \nvi. offered safety planning assistance. \nb. Subject to the limitations set out in section 6 of this policy, those who experience sexual violence will be \nconsidered the primary decision-maker in matters pertaining to themselves. As such, they can determine \nwhether, to whom and what to disclose, and whether to make a complaint within the University and/or an \nexternal law enforcement agency. \n5. RESPONSIBILITIES \na. The University recognizes its institutional responsibility to: \ni. provide an effective policy and procedures to address and prevent sexual violence, \nii. raise awareness about the policy and procedures and relevant support services on campus \nthrough institution-wide education, \niii. raise awareness of consent, sexual violence, prevention, and appropriate responses to \ndisclosures of sexual violence through institution-wide education, \niv. balance the duty to ensure procedural fairness for any person accused of sexual violence with \nsupport and fairness for the complainant within the University’s complaint processes,  \nv. maintaining safe and neutral mechanisms for individuals to disclose or make a complaint of \nsexual violence, \nvi. ensuring the safety of the working, learning and student residence environment by various \nmeans, including the imposition of interim measures, where appropriate, \nvii. provide coordinated and comprehensive supports for those who disclose sexual violence, and \nviii. ensure that all individuals investigating or adjudicating complaints of sexual violence in any \nUniversity complaints process have appropriate training. \nb. All senior leaders, including the President, Vice-Presidents, Deans, Directors and Chairs and other \nofficers of the University exercise administrative responsibility to implement this policy and the related \nprocedures within their respective areas of responsibility, including by creating, supporting and \n  U of A Policies and Procedures On-Line (UAPPOL) \nmaintaining a work, study and student residence environment that promotes a culture of consent, free \nfrom sexual violence. \nc. All members of the University community are responsible for promoting respect and dignity for each other \nby encouraging a culture of consent; and for contributing to work, study and student residence \nenvironments in which individuals can disclose experiences of sexual violence without fear of disbelief, \ndisrespect or reprisal. \n6. PRIVACY AND CONFIDENTIALITY \na. Privacy and confidentiality are essential for creating an environment where those who have experienced \nsexual violence feel safe in disclosing their experience and seeking support. However, it is important to note \nthat there may be limits to the University’s ability to maintain privacy and confidentiality in some cases, \nincluding where: \ni. there is a likely risk of harm to self or others, or \nii. reporting or action is required or authorized by law or University policy. \nb. Whether or not the University can maintain the privacy and confidentiality of a disclosure will be determined \non a case by case basis, in consultation with relevant University officials. \nc. In relation to complaints, all University complaint processes are confidential. In any complaint process, \nsufficient information, including the identity of the complainant, must and will be disclosed to the accused in \norder to meet the requirements of procedural fairness.  \nd. Whether in the context of a disclosure or a complaint, all parties will be informed of the limits of privacy and \nconfidentiality. In cases where confidentiality cannot be maintained, those affected will be informed and \nsupported throughout the process. In such cases, only necessary information will be disclosed, and only to \nthose with a need to know.  \n7. STATEMENT AGAINST RETALIATION \nRetaliation against any person involved in a disclosure or complaint of sexual violence is prohibited. Where it \nhas jurisdiction, the University will investigate all reports of retaliation in accordance with the appropriate \ncomplaints processes. \n8. BAD FAITH COMPLAINTS \nThe University recognizes the serious nature of complaints made under this policy, and may take disciplinary \naction where allegations of sexual violence are shown to be malicious, fraudulent, and/or vexatious. A \ncomplaint made in good faith is not a violation of this policy even if it is not proven in a complaint process. \n9.

OVERVIEW \na. The University recognizes the difference between a disclosure and a complaint, and is committed to \nresponding to and reducing sexual violence and attending to its effects by providing  \n supports and resources to persons who have experienced sexual violence and to any other member of \nthe University community who has been affected by sexual violence,  \n interim measures to ensure the safety of the University’s learning, working and residence environment, \n processes to fairly adjudicate formal complaints of sexual violence, and \n education and training to the University community about sexual violence and, in particular, to those \ninvestigating and adjudicating complaints of sexual violence.  \nb. The University will consult with University of Alberta Protective Services (UAPS), Human Resource Services, \nlegal, medical, and/or psychological experts and others as appropriate in determining how to act on \ndisclosures or complaints of sexual violence. \n2. PURPOSE \nThe purpose of this procedure is to \n provide guidance to members of the University community on receiving and responding to disclosures of \nsexual violence, \n outline supports, modifications and protections the University may be able to offer to persons who have \nexperienced sexual violence,  \n provide authority for the imposition of interim measures to ensure the safety of the working, learning and \nUniversity residence environment,  \n describe the procedures through which complaints of sexual violence will be addressed and, where \nwarranted, discipline imposed, and  \n address education and training in, and awareness of, sexual violence for the University community \ngenerally and, in particular, for those investigating and adjudicating complaints of sexual violence.  \nPROCEDURE \nThe University’s response to a disclosure will, to the extent possible, be guided by the wishes of the person who \nexperienced the sexual violence. In this regard, in response to a disclosure, the person who experienced sexual \n  U of A Policies and Procedures On-Line (UAPPOL) \nviolence can ask the University to provide supports and resources, facilitate academic, residential, recreation \nand/or work modifications, consider the imposition of interim measures, and initiate an investigation of a complaint \nin accordance with the procedures in applicable agreements or policies. \n3. INTERIM MEASURES \na. Interim measures are non-disciplinary conditions that may be imposed on a person alleged to have committed \nsexual violence. The University may impose interim measures in response to either a disclosure or a \ncomplaint where the allegations would \ni. if proven, constitute sexual violence, and \nii. with regard to all of the circumstances, be a risk to an individual, the community or the integrity of any \npotential investigation. \nb. The purpose of such interim measures is to ensure personal safety, discourage or prevent retaliation, \nprevent further sexual violence, protect confidentiality, minimize disruption to the learning, working or \nUniversity Residence environment and/or preserve the University’s ability to conduct a thorough investigation. \nc. Having regard to all of the circumstances, where interim measures are imposed, they must be, appropriate \nand proportionate to the seriousness of the alleged conduct, and as minimally restrictive as possible to \nachieve their purposes. As a result, interim measures will be based on considerations including, but not \nlimited to: \ni. the reasonable wishes of the person who experienced the sexual violence,  \nii. the nature and/or severity of the alleged conduct, \niii. reasonably credible information about patterns of conduct or previous history of sexual violence or other \nmisconduct, \niv. the potential impact of the measures on the person(s), including on their academic program and/or \nemployment,  \nv. the potential impact of the measures on the learning, working or University Residence environment, \nvi. in the case of employees, in accordance with their relevant collective agreement, and \nvii. any other relevant information.  \nExamples of interim measures can be found in the University’s Sexual Violence Interim Measures Information \nDocument. \nd. The decision to impose interim measures will be made by: \ni. in the case of students, the Vice-Provost and Dean of Students, or designate. \nii. in the case of faculty and staff, the Provost and Vice-President (Academic) and/or the Associate Vice-\nPresident (Human Resources), or designate. \niii. in the case of postdoctoral fellows, the Vice-President (Research) , or designate. \nDecision makers may consult as needed in determining whether to impose interim measures and the nature \nof those measures.  \ne. In all cases, decisions on interim measures must be provided in writing and include: \ni. particulars of the measure(s), \nii. information about the right to request a reconsideration, \niii. information about relevant complaint processes, if applicable, and \niv. referrals to supports and/or services. \nf. The person(s) on whom interim measures are imposed may request a reconsideration from the decision \nmaker after sixty (60) days or such earlier time as agreed to by the decision maker. Further, at any time, the \ndecision maker may on his or her own initiative reconsider the interim measures imposed and renew, revise, \nor revoke any or all of the measures, or impose additional interim measures. \ng. Interim measures will be re-evaluated when a complaint process is concluded. \n  U of A Policies and Procedures On-Line (UAPPOL) \n4. PROCEDURES TO ADDRESS COMPLAINTS \na. Complaints of sexual violence will be resolved according to the procedures set out in the University’s \nagreements with the Association of Academic Staff: University of Alberta (AASUA), the Non-Academic Staff \nAssociation (NASA), the Graduate Student Assistantship Collective Agreement, the Postdoctoral Fellows \nDiscipline Procedure, the Code of Student Behaviour, the Residence Agreement, Practicum Intervention \nPolicy, and any other applicable contracts, agreements or policies. \nb. In all cases, use of the procedures at the University does not preclude a report to the appropriate law \nenforcement agency, professional governing body, or pursuing any other civil or other remedy available at \nlaw. \nStudents \nc. Complaints of sexual violence against students will be addressed using procedures outlined in one or more of \nthe following documents. When the person accused in the complaint is:  \ni. a student, the Code of Student Behaviour, \nii. a student living in a University Residence, the Breach of Residence Agreement process,  \niii. a student in a practicum placement, the Practicum Intervention Policy; \niv. a graduate student while appointed in a role as a graduate teaching assistant, graduate research \nassistant or short-term academically-related employment at the time of the offence, the Graduate Student \nAssistantship Collective Agreement. \nAs noted, students may be subject to more than one procedure and may, therefore, be subject to several \nprocedures concurrently.  \nEmployees, postdoctoral fellows and volunteers \nd. Complaints of sexual violence against employees, postdoctoral fellows and volunteers will be resolved \nthrough the following procedures. When the person accused in the complaint is:  \ni. a member of the Non Academic Staff Association (NASA), the processes outlined in the collective \nagreement between the University and NASA;  \nii. or the Association of Academic Staff: University of Alberta (AASUA), the processes outlined in the \napplicable collective agreement between the University and AASUA; \niii. a postdoctoral fellow, the Postdoctoral Fellows Discipline Procedure; \niv. an employee under an employment contract or agreement, but not subject to the above collective \nagreements or Procedure, where no policy or procedure exists and where no procedures are specified in \nthe terms and conditions of their employment, the procedure will be determined on a case-by-case basis, \nensuring that the accused person has the right to: \n1.  an impartial decision-maker, \n2.  know the case to be met, \n3.  an opportunity to respond to the allegations in the complaint, \n4.  be accompanied by an advisor, and \n5.  a timely resolution. \nOthers \ne. When the person accused in a complaint or disclosure is any other person, the University may address the \nmatter through means including, but not limited to, the Trespass to Premises Act of Alberta or the Petty \nTrespass Act of Alberta, reports to the appropriate law enforcement agency or professional governing body. \n5. COMPLAINANT RIGHTS IN COMPLAINTS PROCESS \na. The applicable procedures for investigating and adjudicating complaints of sexual violence are required to \nadhere to the principles of procedural fairness. Adherence to such principles is necessary to ensure that \npersons accused of sexual violence are protected by receiving a fair adjudication. At the same time, the \nprocedures for investigating and adjudicating complaints of sexual violence must also be conducted with due \nregard to their effects on the complainant. Having such regard is necessary in recognition that investigatory \n  U of A Policies and Procedures On-Line (UAPPOL) \nand adjudicative processes can themselves cause additional trauma to a complainant. In balancing these \nobligations, investigators and adjudicators will be mindful to conduct their functions in a way that reduces, to \nthe extent possible, the risk of additional harm to the complainant, while ensuring procedural fairness for the \nperson accused in the complaint. \nb. Without limiting the foregoing, but subject to the provisions of any applicable collective agreement, the \ncomplainant will have the right to: \ni. be accompanied by a support person throughout their participation in any investigatory or disciplinary \nproceedings, \nii. be informed of, make and respond to procedural requests, \niii. make oral or written representations on their own behalf, through their support person or other \nappropriate party, regarding impact and sanction, \niv. receive a copy of the written reasons for the decision. \n6. PREVENTION, EDUCATION AND TRAINING \na. Further information about: \n receiving and managing a disclosure of sexual violence, can be found in the University’s Responding to a \nDisclosure of Sexual Assault, available at https://www.ualberta.ca/current-students/sexual-assault-\ncentre/responding \n support services and resources for persons affected by sexual violence can be found in the University’s \nOptions, Services and Resources for Those who have Experienced Sexual Violence Information \nDocument. \n the steps or measures the University can take, including modifications to academic program(s), University \nresidence, recreational or other programs, or work environment, in response to a disclosure of sexual \nviolence can be found in the University’s Options, Services and Resources for Those who have \nExperienced Sexual Violence Information Document. \nb. The University will provide education to the entire University community on sexual violence including, but not \nlimited to, policy awareness, consent and responding to disclosures.  \ni. Additional workshops will be offered for those more likely to receive disclosures. \nii. Training in bystander intervention, provided on a voluntary basis to students and staff. \nc. All persons (i) investigating complaints of sexual violence, and (ii) adjudicating complaints of sexual violence \nin the complaint resolution procedures outlined above must have appropriate training. \nd. Information on appropriate training can be found in the University’s Sexual Violence Education and Training \nInformation Document. \nDEFINITIONS \nDefinitions should be listed in the sequence they occur in the document (i.e. not alphabetical). \nAny definitions listed in the following table apply to this document only with no implied or intended \ninstitution-wide use.

Stalking - Repeated unwanted contact or communication \ndirected at another person that causes reasonable fear or \nconcern for that person’s safety or the safety of others known \nto them. The harm may be physical, emotional, or \npsychological, or related to the personal safety, property, \neducation, or employment of an individual.  \nStalking can occur physically (such as watching and \nmonitoring, pursuing or following, making threatening or \nobscene gestures, sending unsolicited gifts), electronically (for \nexample, continuously commenting or contacting via social \nmedia, surveillance, letters, text messages, emails or phone \ncalls), and/or through a third party.  \nd.

This \ndocument is intended to provide a non-exhaustive list of the various options available so that all students, staff, postdoctoral fellows and faculty \ncan assist in making appropriate referrals upon receiving a disclosure or make informed decisions for themselves after experiencing sexual \nviolence.  \nIndividual reactions to sexual violence will differ greatly, and a person's decision about how to respond to an experience of sexual violence may \nchange over time. Whether the result of a disclosure or a complaint, the University can assist with some of those responses, including providing \nacademic, work or University residence modifications, safety planning, personal support, making a complaint or other options that meet the goals \nof the Sexual Violence policy and related procedures.  \nSome may need a more comprehensive and coordinated response. The SVRT (Sexual Violence Response Team) is convened when an individual \ndiscloses that they have experienced sexual violence, and may need more than one modification to meet the goals of the Sexual Violence policy. \nIt is designed to provide access to multiple options, resources and responses without the individual having to approach each service separately.  \nIt should be understood that mediation is not appropriate for situations involving sexual violence. Mediation is a conflict resolution mechanism that \npresumes all parties have an equal role in resolving a conflict. Sexual violence is not a conflict, but a harm inflicted on another person. Mediation \nintroduces a significant risk of additional harm to the person to whom the violence was done and should never be considered an option in cases of \nsexual violence. \nWHAT ARE MY OPTIONS? \nPersonal Support | Medical Assistance | Safety | Modifications – Academic/Work/Living | Complaints | Other Resources and Services \nOptions, Resources and Services Information Document     Page 2 \nPersonal\tSupport\t\nOPTION HOW DO I DO THIS?

As one example, if a \nvictim did not scream or fight or say “no,” the assumption may be that there must have been implicit consent. These \nassumptions can be held by anyone receiving a disclosure, investigating, or adjudicating a complaint, or even by \nthose who have experienced sexual violence themselves. Education on these and other topics is designed to correct \nthese misconceptions. In addition, research on the potential effects of trauma on memory, recall and behaviour sheds \nnew light on methods for interviewing those who have experienced trauma. \nThe goals of education, bystander intervention and other training are to help those who experience sexual violence \nfeel safer in disclosing and/or making a complaint and seeking support; ensure that those who receive disclosures \nknow how to support and refer; allow investigators to use trauma-informed interview techniques in order to get the \nbest information possible from complainants; and ensure that decision-makers in complaint processes are able to \nappropriately interpret the evidence before them. Below is a non-exhaustive list of selected training and education \nopportunities. Any other relevant training should also be considered, as appropriate. \nFOR THE UNIVERSITY COMMUNITY \nThe resources below are available to members of the University community at no cost and provide education and \ntraining in the areas of understanding sexual assault, consent, bystander intervention, gender based violence, effects \nof trauma and trauma-informed interviewing.  \nSexual Assault Centre (no cost) \n Videos: Understanding Sexual Assault \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3j3qgLRQaIw&list=PL2V1RRG3M1rTKPuhw2eHWvVlVcrBcDKsH&index\n=1  \n Online guide: How to Respond to a Disclosure of Sexual Violence https://www.ualberta.ca/current-\nstudents/sexual-assault-centre/responding \n Working for Change workshops: Email edcoord@ualberta.ca  \nthe Landing (no cost) \nThe Gender Based Violence Prevention Program (GBVPP) is a campus and community-wide initiative designed to \nincrease awareness, education, communication, inclusion and safety.

This \nincludes, but is not limited to the following: \na. Sexual Assault  - Any form of sexual contact without consent. \nThis can include unwanted or forced kissing, fondling, vaginal \nor anal penetration or touching, or oral sexual contact. \nEducation and Training Information Document   Page 4 \nb. Sexual Harassment - as defined in the UAPPOL \nDiscrimination, Harassment and Duty to Accommodate Policy. \nc. Stalking - Repeated unwanted contact or communication \ndirected at another person that causes reasonable fear or \nconcern for that person’s safety or the safety of others known \nto them. The harm may be physical, emotional, or \npsychological, or related to the personal safety, property, \neducation, or employment of an individual.  \nStalking can occur physically (such as watching and \nmonitoring, pursuing or following, making threatening or \nobscene gestures, sending unsolicited gifts), electronically (for \nexample, continuously commenting or contacting via social \nmedia, surveillance, letters, text messages, emails or phone \ncalls), and/or through a third party.  \nd. Indecent Exposure - Exposing one’s genitals, buttocks and/or \nbreasts or inducing another to expose their own genitals, \nbuttocks and/or breasts in non-consensual circumstances, in \nperson or electronically. \ne.

Inducing intoxication, impairment or incapacity for the purpose \nof making another person vulnerable to non-consensual sexual \nactivity. \nh. Other analogous conduct. \nConsent Consent is a voluntary, ongoing, active and conscious agreement to engage in the sexual activity in question. Consent or a “yes” that is \nobtained through pressure, coercion, force, threats or by inducing \nintoxication, impairment or incapacity is not voluntary consent. Silence \nor ambiguity do not constitute consent. \nAdditionally, there is no consent when: \n it is given by someone else. \n the person is unconscious, sleeping, highly intoxicated or high, \nor otherwise lacks the capacity to consent. \n it was obtained through the abuse of a position of power, trust \nor authority. \n the person does not signify “yes”, says “no” or implies “no” \nEducation and Training Information Document   Page 5 \nthrough words or behaviours. \n the person changes their mind and withdraws their consent. \nConsent cannot be implied (for example, by a current or past \nrelationship, by consent to another activity, or by failure to say “no” or \nresist). In addition, consent cannot be given in advance of sexual \nactivity that is expected to occur at a later time. It is the responsibility of \nthe person wanting to engage in sexual activity to obtain clear consent \nfrom the other and to recognize that consent can be withdrawn at any \ntime. \nComplainant An individual who makes a complaint under a University process. \nRELATED LINKS \nShould a link fail, please contact uappol@ualberta.ca.
