Discussion: Dr Parilla explained that this program is one-of-a-kind internationally, and is based on feedback provided by Alberta educators in regards to inclusive educational opportunities for students with complex communication needs, which is a growing area. In regards to the program, he noted that it includes five online courses and that the program has partnered with the University of North Carolina, which will provide the program with sufficient expertise and foster access to the United States market, as well. Members discussed the cost of tuition for this certificate, and Dr Parrila explained that it is not expected to be a barrier to access. In addition, he acknowledged that expansion of the program at a Faculty level has not been considered. A member suggested that more planning could be done to assess another fee model for students enrolled in the program outside of Canada. Ms Collins noted that this is expected to be a cost-recovery program. Dr Parrila confirmed that the University of Alberta will retain copyrights to the material.",

Discussion: Dr Breitkreuz reported that this proposal aims to modernize the name of this major to align with existing field standards, and that it will assist in student recruitment. Specifically, she reported that this comes as a result of a call from the National Council of Family Relations recommending a common term throughout the field. A member enquired about whether this name change may be problematic for students in the future. A member pointed out that the name change seems to soften the name of the program, and enquired whether faculty members have recommended against it as a result. In response, Dr Breitkreuz explained that this name change would not impact the ontology of the program, but rather, relates more to a necessary brand change to attempt to heighten the profile of the program. A member expressed concern that this proposal follows a trend towards changing a name to fit current popular perspective.",

Most educators currently teaching students \nwith CCN lack the necessary training and experience to use specialized \nsupports effectively and to successfully teach students with CCN. \nTSCCN provides then with the necessary training. \nReplaces/Revises (eg, policies, \nresolutions) \nN/A \nTimeline/Implementation Date September 1, 2017 \nEstimated Cost and funding \nsource \n$70,000 (Alberta Education $62,500; JP Das Centre $7,500) – see \nproposed budget for estimated cost. \nNext Steps (ie.: \nCommunications Plan, \nImplementation plans) \nAdvanced Education for approval. The proposal is already shared with \nAlberta Education, Alberta Teachers Association, School \nSuperintendents, and Regional Collaborative Service Delivery (RCSD) \ncentres who are responsible for services. All are waiting for a go ahead \nto advertise it as the need for these specialists is urgent. \nSupplementary Notes and \ncontext \nN/A \nAlignment/Compliance \nAlignment with Guiding \nDocuments \nFor the Public Good \nGOAL: EXPERIENCE diverse and rewarding learning opportunities that APC Item 5 - page 1\nItem No. 5 \nGFC ACADEMIC PLANNING COMMITTEE \nFor the Meeting of December 14, 2016 \ninspire us, nurture our talents, expand our knowledge and skills, and \nenable our success. \nObjective 10: Expand access to and engagement in the University of \nAlberta for learners engaging in continuing and professional education \nprograms, experiences, and lifelong learning activities. \nStrategy i: Develop continuing and professional education programs that \nconnect the knowledge-mobilization activities of the university’s faculty \nmembers to the needs of diverse learner communities. \nStrategy ii: Create a wide range of opportunities, both in person and \nvirtual, for broad, learning-centred programs for alumni and other \ncommunities of learners engaging in continuing and professional \neducation. \nGOAL: EXCEL as individuals, and together, sustain a culture that fosters \nand champions distinction and distinctiveness in teaching, learning, \nresearch, and service. \nObjective 14:  Inspire, model, and support excellence in teaching and \nlearning. \nStrategy i: Foster, encourage, and support innovation and \nexperimentation in curriculum development, teaching, and learning at the \nindividual, unit, and institutional levels. \nThe 2016 Comprehensive Institution Plan \n“TEACHING AND LEARNING This is the core activity of the university—\nsupporting undergraduate and graduate students, researchers, and \nscholars, as well as accomplished members of professions who need to \nrefresh their educations to advance their positions in industry or to \nadvance industry itself.” \nCompliance with Legislation, \nPolicy and/or Procedure \nRelevant to the Proposal \n(please quote legislation and \ninclude identifying section \nnumbers) \n1.

The \nreview will focus on the institution’s assessment of student and employer demand; the situation of the \nprogram in the context of Campus Alberta; the financial viability of the program, including \nimplications for students and taxpayers; and dimensions of program quality.   \nBasic Information \nInstitution University of Alber ta \nProgram/specialization title \nTeaching Students with Complex \nCommunication Needs  \nCredential awarded University Cer tificate in Teaching Students \nwith Complex Communication Needs \nProposed Implementation Date September , 2017 \nAPC Item 5 - page 6\nNew Program Proposal – Comprehensive Review 2 \nCertificate/Diploma/Non-credential Programs  \nSECTION 1:  PROGRAM OVERVIEW \n1.1  Type of Initiative \nNew freestanding for credit University Certificate in Teaching Students with Complex Communication Needs. \n(Admission: Bachelor’s Degree) \n1.2  Program Description \nProvide a brief (1-2 paragraphs) description of the program, summarizing its intended purpose, curriculum \ndesign, and methods of delivery and highlighting distinctive attributes.  Attach as an Appendix a complete list of \ncourses, including credit values, instructional hours and brief (calendar style) course descriptions.  For elective \noptions, specify course selection parameters. Identify new courses to be developed for this program.   \nStudents with complex communication needs (CCN) are unable to communicate effectively using speech or \nsigned language alone and benefit from augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) strategies and tools \nto support communication and learning. They may also have vision impairment, hearing loss, physical \nchallenges, cognitive disabilities or some combination of any number of impairments that impact their learning \n(Iacono, 2014; Perry, Reilly, Cotton, Bloomberg, & Johnson, 2004). Students with CCN require specialized \nsupports to promote successful participation and learning as they work to access the general education \ncurriculum and to achieve general education standards and their individualized learning goals. Most educators \ncurrently teaching students with CCN lack the necessary training and experience to use specialized supports \neffectively and to successfully teach students with CCN (Costigan & Light, 2010). AAC is a foundational \ncomponent of instruction for students with CCN, and at present there are no university programs in Canada that \nfocus on teaching students with severe disabilities, such as those typically experienced by this population. The \nproposed free-standing University Certificate in Teaching Students with Complex Communication Needs \n(TSCCN) is a certificate program aimed at practicing teachers, learning coaches, and related professionals with \na Bachelor’s degree who work on multi-disciplinary teams to support the participation and learning of students \nwith CCN. TSCCN builds upon existing courses at the University of Alberta and the professional development \ncourses available at the Center for Literacy and Disability Studies at the University of North Carolina at Chapel \nHill. TSCCN’s goal is to make this critical content available to all Alberta educators and to educators and related \nprofessionals across the globe via online delivery. \nTSCCN provides educators with the knowledge and skills required to effectively support students’ ongoing \ngrowth in communication, language, literacy, and numeracy. TSCCN includes five courses (see Appendix A) \nthat explore the foundational knowledge and research-validated practices in comprehensive language, literacy \nand numeracy education.  The courses will be offered online one at a time in eight to twelve week blocks to \nallow full-time educators to participate. Educators completing TSCCN will be able to: (1) support development of \nand teach language skills to students with CCN through the use of AAC strategies and systems; (2) implement \ncomprehensive research-validated literacy instruction to students with CCN; (3) provide research-validated \ninstruction in numeracy to students with CCN; (4) provide instructional leadership in addressing the needs of \nstudents with CCN in their respective schools and school districts. \nTSCCN is unique in the world in its scope and focus. TSCCN is designed and delivered by a team of experts \nthat includes AAC specialists, literacy specialists, numeracy specialists, special educators, and university \nresearchers committed to promoting quality evidence-based approaches to teaching students with CCN. \nTSCCN is designed to meet the diverse needs of educators across Alberta and beyond. \n1.3  Enrolment Plan \nInclude assumptions and explanatory notes (e.g., attrition, part-time enrolment).   \nAPC Item 5 - page 7\nNew Program Proposal – Comprehensive Review 3 \nCertificate/Diploma/Non-credential Programs  \nTo be financially viable and sustainable in terms of instructor resources over a longer period of time, the \nUniversity Certificate in Teaching Students with Complex Communication Needs (TSCCN) will accept new \nstudents every two years and will be offered to a cohort of 25 students over two years. The Department of \nEducational Psychology has offered cohort programs for over 20 years, and recognizes the strengths of the \ncohort model for completion rate, student experience (Seifert and Mandzuk, 2006), and for building professional \nlearning communities (Lei, Gorelick, Short, Smallwood, and Wright-Porter, 2011) that continue collaborating \nafter completion of the program. For example, the Department of Educational Psychology have experienced \nhigh graduation rates for those students who have enrolled in School Counselling and Special Education cohort \nMaster’s programs. \nTSCCN is designed for part-time online study and all students will be part-time students. The maximum \nallowable time to complete the program is four years from the date of registration, but most students are \nexpected to complete the program in two years with their respective cohort. Based on our experience with \ncohort programs, we expect that there will be about 10% attrition due to changing work circumstances and other \nsignificant commitments. Students who will not be able to continue with their cohort will be offered an \nopportunity to complete their program with the next cohort.   \n• If program implementation will occur over a number of years, provide data for each year to full \nimplementation. \nIdeally, TSCCN will start in January 2017 with one cohort of 25 students, 23 of whom are expected to complete \nthe program in year 2. The second cohort will start in year 3 (2019), and so on. We expect to graduate 23 to 25 \nstudents every second year.  \n• If internal reallocation of existing resources is proposed, describe any anticipated decrease in \nenrolment in other programs that would result.   \nNo reallocation of resources is required and as TSCCN does not overlap with existing undergraduate or \ncertificate programs, we don’t anticipate it to affect enrolment in other programs. It may increase interest in \nspecial education graduate programs across Campus Alberta institutions. It may also increase interest in \ngraduate studies in Rehabilitation Medicine at the University of Alberta. \nProposed Enrolment Year 1 2017 \nYear 2 \n2018 \nYear 3 \n2019 \nYear 4 \n2020 \nYear 5 \n2021 \nBiennial \nOngoing \nTotal head count 0 0 0 0 0 0 \n• Part-Time Year 1 25 0 25 0 25 25 EVERY \nSECOND YEAR \n• Part-Time Year 2 0 23 0 23 0 23 EVERY \nSECOND YEAR \nAnticipated No. of Graduates 0 23 0 23 0 23 EVERY \nSECOND YEAR \nAPC Item 5 - page 8\nNew Program Proposal – Comprehensive Review 4 \nCertificate/Diploma/Non-credential Programs  \nSECTION 2:  DEMAND \n2.1  Student Demand Analysis \nAnalysis should be supported by relevant data for the region and for Campus Alberta, as might be derived from: \nsystematic questionnaire surveys of target audiences; application and enrolment summaries and trends for \nsimilar programs currently offered by other institutions; tabulations of unsolicited student inquiries and/or \nexpressions of interest obtained at student recruitment events; demographic projections for relevant sub-\npopulations.  \nThe TSCCN certificate proposal has been developed in response to demand from educators across Alberta and \nNorth America for formalized instruction in supporting the communication, literacy, and numeracy development \nof children and youth with CCN. The certificate builds on the professional development work at the Center for \nLiteracy and Disability Studies at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, and on current research, \nteaching, and professional development initiatives of scholars at the University of Alberta.  \nAs an indication of demand for this type of coursework, in the summer of 2015, 60 teachers, speech language \npathologists and occupational therapists attended a 5-day summer course on Communication and Literacy for \nStudents with Significant Disabilities taught by Dr. Karen Erickson, Director Center for Literacy and Disability \nStudies, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, David E. & Dolores (Dee) Yoder Distinguished Professor of \nLiteracy and Disability Studies, Director, Center for Literacy & Disability Studies, University of North Carolina at \nChapel Hill, and Dr. David Koppenhaver, Reading Program Director and Professor of Reading Education, \nAppalachian State University. The course was initially capped at 50 participants, but due to the larger demand \nfor this course 10 seats were added. Even with these additional seats, many interested educators were turned \naway. In October 2015, 260 educators attended a preconference session with Dr. Erickson held as part of the \nAlberta Teachers’ Association Council for Inclusive Education conference held in Edmonton. Further, CCN \nCommunity of Practice supported by Alberta Education and Regional Collaborative Service Delivery agencies \nhas over 200 participants that have attended the limited available professional development opportunities across \nthe province over the past two years. \nIn addition to the demand for information on teaching students with CCN across Alberta, Drs. Erickson and \nKoppenhaver do an average of 6 summer courses each year and are booked for trainings two years out. They \nhave done the 5-day courses in Portugal, Australia, and many Canadian provinces.  \nAt present there are no university credit courses that specifically focus on teaching this population of students. \nThis partnership between the JP Das Centre of Developmental and Learning Disabilities at the University of \nAlberta and the Center for Literacy and Disability Studies at the University of North Carolina will create the first \nof its kind certificate in the area of CCN where the emphasis is on literacy and numeracy as well as on \ndeveloping communication skills. Due to the international reputation and reach of the contributors and online \ndelivery, we expect to draw students from around the world. \n2.2  Labour Market Analysis \nAnalysis should be supported by relevant data and placed in the context of the target occupational/regional \nlabour market(s).  Relevant data sources include systematic surveys of prospective employers; occupational \nsupply/demand projections from government or industry sources; tabulations of job postings/‘help wanted’ \nadvertising; surveys of recruitment and graduate employment rates of similar programs; and demographic \nprojections (i.e. for relevant regions and sub-populations.)  Describe anticipated employment outcomes. \nStudents with CCN are identified as a “low-incidence” population. Prevalence data related to the number of \nstudents with complex communication needs vary by country, age and type of disability (Beukelman & Mirenda, \n2013). Recent estimates of the prevalence of complex communication needs among students receiving special \neducation services in different countries vary from a low of 3% of students receiving special education services \nAPC Item 5 - page 9\nNew Program Proposal – Comprehensive Review 5 \nCertificate/Diploma/Non-credential Programs  \nin 54 districts in Connecticut (Worah, 2011) to a high of 40% of students served in a variety of special education \nprograms in Israel (Weiss, Seligman-Wine, Lebel, Arzi, & Yalon-Chamovitz, 2005). Among preschoolers \nreceiving special education services in sites in Pennsylvania the reported prevalence was 12% (Binger & Light, \n2006), while 39% of students with severe intellectual disability were reported to have complex communication \nneeds in 19 schools in South Africa (Alant, 1999). Similar studies have not been completed in Alberta but \nCentral Alberta RCSD (see the attached letter of support) currently serves 98 children and assesses about 35 \nmore each year in their limited geographical area, and Calgary and Area RCSD serves over 400 learners with \nCCN (see the attached letter of support); on the basis of these numbers, we estimate that the overall frequency \nvaries between one and three students per school in typical inclusive education settings.  \nDespite the apparent low incidence of this population, speech-language pathologists, special education \nteachers, and occupational therapists are all likely to encounter individuals with complex communication needs \nwho require augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) in clinical and educational practice (Costigan & \nLight, 2010).  Up to 48% of speech-language pathologists working in the U.S. report that they work with students \nwho are non-verbal or use augmentative/alternative communication systems (ASHA, 2014). Similarly, up to 80% \nof special education teachers reported that they provided services to individuals with CCN (ASHA, 2002; Locke \n& Mirenda, 1992). The need for educators, particularly special educators, to have knowledge and skills in \nteaching children with CCN is great. There is also an increasing need for specialized professionals to support \ngeneral education teachers who have students with CCN in their classrooms. A recent study commissioned by \nthe Alberta Teachers Association to understand the state of inclusion in Alberta classrooms indicates that \nteachers are dissatisfied with availability of specialized professional supports (ATA, 2015) and this \ndissatisfaction is expressed with an increase in demand for professional development in the area (see above).  \nThe Government of Alberta recently established the Regional Collaborative Service Delivery (RCSD) model. \nThis model was created to support collaboration across the ministries of Education, Health and Human \nServices. Children and youth with CCN have been identified as one of the groups specifically targeted through \nthis effort. Extra funding resources are available to regions to provide appropriate supports and services for \nthese students, but there are insufficient numbers of professionals available to provide the supports and \nservices. In a recent survey of the Leadership teams, the need for professional expertise in the area of CCN was \nstrongly indicated. As a result, Alberta Education provided a grant for the development of this certificate and a \nletter of support (see attached).  \n2.3  Support \nProvide evidence of consultation with and approval/support from relevant professional organizations, \nregulatory bodies, advisory committees, employers, and/or industry. \nLetters of support from Alberta Education, the College of Alberta School Superintendents, Alberta Teachers’ \nAssociation, Center for Literacy & Disability Studies in University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, nine different \nRegional Collaborative Service Delivery agencies, and Universities of Athabasca, Calgary and Lethbridge are \nattached.  \n2.4  Clinical or Work Experience \nIf clinical or work experience is an essential part of program delivery: \n2.4.1 Provide evidence that the placements will be available when needed. \n2.4.2 Describe the student’s role in securing placements. \n2.4.3 Explain how the institution will supervise/monitor the learning experience of students in off-site settings? \n2.4.4 Identify potential employer/employee liability related to this aspect of the program, and how the institution \nintends to manage this liability. \nAPC Item 5 - page 10\nNew Program Proposal – Comprehensive Review 6 \nCertificate/Diploma/Non-credential Programs  \nSECTION 3:  INSTITUTIONAL AND SYSTEM CONTEXT \n3.1  Institutional Strategy \nHow does the proposed program align with the institution’s strategic priorities and the Comprehensive \nInstitutional Plan? \nThe proposed program is in line with the University of Alberta’s new Institutional Strategic Plan “For the Public \nGood” whose mission statement includes benefitting society through teaching and learning, community \ninvolvement, and partnerships. Further, TSCCN aligns closely with four of the seven value statements by \npromoting (1) the equality and dignity of all persons, (2) excellence in teaching that enriches experiences, \nadvances knowledge, and promotes public good, (3) the provision of intellectually rewarding educational \nexperiences to learners at all stages of life, and (4) the diversity, inclusivity and equity among some of the most \nvulnerable student populations.     \nMore specifically, TSCCN directly serves to materialize Objective 9 of the Plan: Expand access to and \nengagement in continuing and professional education programs, experiences, and lifelong learning activities. \nTSCCN provides engaging and critical learning opportunities to professionals by offering them pathways for \npursuit of specialized interests, cross-disciplinary learning, and professional and academic development. The \ncertificate is offered as credit courses to allow participating teachers to use university credits for salary \nincrement purposes. Further, TSCCN is designed and delivered by a team of experts that includes AAC \nspecialists, literacy specialists, special educators, and university researchers committed to knowledge-\nmobilization of research-validated approaches to teaching students with CCN. TSCCN will promote dialogue \nbetween university researchers and practicing teachers, and between teachers at different parts of the province \nand the world. It will help create learning communities focused on the best practices with students with CCN. \nTSCCN aims to provide exceptional and life-changing experiences to the participants by providing them with the \nknowledge, skills, and attitudes required to facilitate the research-validated practices in the schools they serve \nthat will promote successful participation and learning of their students with CCN. \n3.2  Institutional Programs \nExplain how the proposed program fits with existing programs at the institution, and the anticipated positive or \nnegative impacts on other programs. \nTSCCN is unique and has no overlap with existing certificate, undergraduate or graduate programs, and thus it \nis not expected to impact these in any manner. Due to its focus on providing quality instruction to a very specific \ngroup of learners, TSCCN will provide teachers who complete it an excellent entry-point for graduate studies in \npsychology, special education, rehabilitation medicine, speech language pathology, and language and literacy \nstudies. Such graduate programs are currently offered in multiple faculties at the University of Alberta (Faculty \nof Education, Department of Educational Psychology and the Faculty of Rehabilitation Medicine) as well as in \nother Campus Alberta institutions. \n3.3  Internal Review and Approval \nProvide a brief description of the internal review and approval process followed in developing the proposal. \nThis proposal was developed in consultation with Dr. Randy Wimmer, Acting Dean of the Faculty of Education, \nYvonne Norton, Assistant Dean, Dr. Lynn McGarvey, Vice Dean, Dr. Jacqueline Leighton, Department Chair of \nEducational Psychology, Dr. Rauno Parrila, Professor and Director of JP Das Centre on Developmental and \nLearning Disabilities, and Dr. Karen Erickson, the Director of the Center for Literacy and Disability Studies, a \nProfessor in the Division of Speech and Hearing Sciences, and the Yoder Distinguished Professor in the \nDepartment of Allied Health Sciences, School of Medicine at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. \nThe proposal was presented for review and accepted by the Department of Educational Psychology Department \nAPC Item 5 - page 11\nNew Program Proposal – Comprehensive Review 7 \nCertificate/Diploma/Non-credential Programs  \nCouncil in January 2016.  Faculty of Education accepted the proposal in June 2016 through the Undergraduate \nAcademic Affairs Council.   \n3.4  Campus Alberta Programs/Initiatives \nDiscuss the relationships (similarity, complementarity, transfer, competition) of the proposed program to other \nprograms or initiatives in Campus Alberta and explain what the proposed program would add to the system.  If \nthe proposed program would duplicate existing programs, explain why that duplication is warranted.   \nThe proposed program is unique in North America and the world. No other program in Canada focuses on the \nunique skills and knowledge necessary for teaching students with complex communication needs. The Special \nEducation Master’s program at the University of Alberta focuses on Reading, Writing, and Oral Language \nDisabilities, but particularly considers higher functioning populations. University of Calgary offers a Master’s \nprogram in Language and Literacy that focuses on cultural and linguistic diversity. University of Lethbridge offers \na Master’s program in Teaching, Learning and Neuroscience that focuses on brain-based education. Athabasca \nUniversity offers an Inclusive Education Minor that includes a course in assistive technology; assistive \ntechnology courses have also been offered periodically at University of Alberta and University of Calgary and \nthey are the only ones that have some overlapping content with the current certificate.  \n3.5  Consultation \nSummarize the type and outcomes of consultations with other institutions offering related programs. Attach \ncopies of relevant documents (e.g. letters, meeting summaries).  Discuss the potential for inter-institutional \ncollaboration.   \nNo other institutions offer related programs. However, the courses for TSCCN have been developed in \ncollaboration with experts from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Consultation with outside experts \nwill continue with regards to assessment of the program’s impact and its further development, as well as in \nidentifying the best instructors for each course. Letters of support for TSCCN from University of Calgary, \nUniversity of Lethbridge, and Athabasca University are attached. \n3.6  Learner Pathways \n3.6.1 Identify potential pathways from work to school (where applicable). \nTSCCN participants will be practicing teachers and other professionals (e.g., Speech Language Pathologists) \nstudying part time. We expect that upon completion of the certificate, some will be interested in pursuing further \nstudies at the graduate level either full- or part-time. \n3.6.2 Identify potential opportunities for transfer/laddering into the proposed program from other institutions or \nother programs within the institution; and for transfer/laddering from the proposed program to other \nprograms within the institution or at other institutions.  List any formal agreements for internal or inter-\ninstitutional transfer/laddering that have been negotiated to this point. \nAs TSCCN is a free-standing university certificate that requires a Bachelor’s Degree for entry, students will not \ntransfer or ladder into TSCCN from other programs. Further, since the admission criteria for university \ncertificates and graduate level degree programs differ, and because the courses taken as part of this certificate \nmay be taken at the undergraduate level, there is no automatic laddering from this certificate to other programs, \nsuch as a graduate-level Master’s program.  \n3.6.3 Estimate the portion of graduates who can be expected to proceed to further education directly. At a later \nstage in their careers.  What types of programs/credentials would they be most likely to pursue?   \nAPC Item 5 - page 12\nNew Program Proposal – Comprehensive Review 8 \nCertificate/Diploma/Non-credential Programs  \nWe expect that about a third of the graduates will consider graduate studies immediately upon completion and \nabout ten percent will pursue graduate studies one to three years subsequent to the completion of the \ncertificate.  \nSECTION 4:  FINANCIAL VIABILITY AND SUSTAINABILITY \n4.1  Annual Budget and Funding Sources \nIdentify annual and one-time expenditures and annual revenue for the program in the budget tables below.  If \nprogram implementation will take place over more than one year, provide estimates for each year until full \nimplementation.  Provide explanatory notes for all budget assumptions, such as inflation and per student tuition. \n(For proposals without significant impacts on institutional costs, revenues or enrolment, a detailed budget presentation will \nnot normally be required (please confirm with the department).  Such proposals will satisfy all of the following tests: \n1. The proposal is for a new specialization in an existing program, consisting of an innovative combination of existing \ncurricula. \n2. Overall enrolment capacity in the program is maintained. \n3.

The tuition is estimated based on delivery costs for \nonline programs being higher than face-to-face programs because of the need for further material development \nand IT support and maintenance. The proposed tuition is in line with other Education certificate programs under \nconsideration at the University of Alberta. At $1600 per student/per course (plus future CPI indexed increases), \nthe program is calculated to recover the instructional, administrative, and support costs associated with running \nit after the first year even if enrolment in a cohort falls to 20 students.    \n4.2.2 Discuss the financial impact on students and the learner funding system, taking into account the costs of \neducation and the potential debt burden relative to post-graduation earning capacity. \nThe cost for students will be $1,600 per course (plus future CPI indexed increases), or $8,000 for the program \nover the course of two years. We assume that school boards will allow their teachers to use existing \nprofessional development funds to support the tuition fees and make tuition supplements available.  \n4.2.3 If program funding includes internal reallocation, evaluate the impact of this reallocation on the \ninstitution’s operations and overall financial position. \nNot applicable \nAPC Item 5 - page 14\nNew Program Proposal – Comprehensive Review 10 \nCertificate/Diploma/Non-credential Programs  \nSECTION 5:  QUALITY ASSESSMENT \n5.1 Institutional Capacity \n5.1.1 List instructional positions that would support the proposed program, specifying position title, credential \nand experience requirements, and areas of expertise.  Distinguish between new and existing positions; \nand regular and sessional appointments.  Describe mechanisms (existing and planned) to develop and \nensure currency of teaching skills and disciplinary expertise. \nThe TSCCN content has been developed jointly by the JP Das Centre on Developmental and Learning \nDisabilities at the University of Alberta and the Center for Literacy and Disability Studies at the University of North \nCarolina at Chapel Hill. The course development is funded by a grant from Alberta Education. \nThe developers of specific TSCCN courses will be offered an opportunity to teach those courses. When they are \nnot available, they will be asked to identify other experts who can be asked to contribute. Postdoctoral and PhD \nresearch fellows at the Center for Literacy and Disability Studies, the JP Das Centre, and the Department of \nEducational Psychology at the University of Alberta will provide additional sources of expertise to support this \ncertificate. \nAs topics covered by TSCCN overlap significantly with research interests of the professors involved, currency of \nthe disciplinary expertise will be maintained. Similarly, as all instructors are active instructors in Education or \nrelated professions in university settings, currency of teaching skills should not be an issue. \n5.1.2 List instructional support positions (e.g. lab technicians, tutors) related to the proposed program.  \nTSCCN will be supported by graduate teaching assistants (GTAs at the PhD level) and one part-time \nadministrative assistant who is responsible for the technology maintenance and program administration. Costs \nfor these positions are included in the salary and benefits line of the budget above.  \n5.1.3 Describe facilities, equipment and information resources (existing and planned) that would house and \nsupport delivery of the proposed program. \nAll necessary facilities and equipment exist in the JP Das Centre and the Center for Literacy and Disability \nStudies; no new facilities are required besides a computer and necessary software for the administrative \nassistant. The University of Alberta library currently provides all the information resources needed, and the \nuniversity provides a platform for delivering online instruction (eClass).  \n5.1.4 Discuss the anticipated impacts of the proposed program on student support services. \nNo impact is anticipated due to all students being part-time students who take their courses online. All courses \ninclude a full-time GTA who will provide the students with technical support. \n5.2 Curriculum  \nThe curriculum for the proposed TSCCN program was developed based on the work of the Centre for Literacy \nand Disability Studies, in particular the professional development series that was created to support the \nDynamic Learning Maps Alternative Assessment and the research done at the Center in the area of effective \ncommunication and literacy practices for students with CCN. \nAPC Item 5 - page 15\nNew Program Proposal – Comprehensive Review 11 \nCertificate/Diploma/Non-credential Programs  \nThe curriculum development was further supported by the identification of educators’ professional learning \nneeds during the Communication and Literacy Summer Courses and the demand for ongoing professional \ndevelopment by the Alberta Professional Development Consortia and the ATA Inclusive Education Specialist \nCouncil. \n5.3 Academic Standards \nList the requirements for admission and any alternate routes to admission; for residency; for academic \nprogression; and for graduation.  Compare these requirements to those for similar programs. \nWe want TSCCN certificate be accessible to all teachers who need it. For this reason, the program is offered as \na university certificate rather than as a post-baccalaureate certificate that would require the applicants to meet \nthe general admission requirements of the Faculty of Graduate Studies and Research. The admission \nrequirements are as follows: \nTo be eligible for admission to University Certificate programs applicants must: \n(1) present a three- or four-year degree from an accredited postsecondary institution \n(2) meet the English Language proficiency requirements as specified in §13.3. \nSupporting Documents  \n(1) Official post-secondary degree transcripts demonstrating that the degree has been awarded.  \n(2) Most recent post-secondary transcripts, if they are from a different institution than (1). (Optional) \n(3) Letter of intent. \nGraduation: Certificates will be awarded for the successful completion of the designated courses within the \nCertificate and with a final GPA of 2.0 or above. Certificates must be completed within four years. \nApplication and Document Deadline: Applications will be submitted directly to the Faculty of Education and are \ndue one month before the next intake. Completed applications will be reviewed by TSCCN Admission \nCommittee.      \n5.4  Learning Outcomes    \n5.4.1 Summarize the learning outcomes of the proposed program (e.g. career-specific knowledge and skills, \nemployability skills).   \nTSCCN will provide special education teachers and other professionals with advanced knowledge and skills on \nhow to: \n• Implement Augmentative and Alternative Communication methods in the context of educational \nexperiences; \n• Design and deliver comprehensive literacy instruction for students with CCN; \n• Implement research-validated literacy and numeracy instruction and interventions to students with CCN \nin a variety of educational contexts;  \n• Work as a part of a multidisciplinary team in planning and delivering instruction to students with CCN; \nand \n• Provide effective leadership in their respective schools. \nTSCCN consists of five courses that focus on instructional design and methods, augmentative and alternative \ncommunication, emergent literacy, conventional literacy, and numeracy. \nThe key learning outcomes of each course are explained below.  \n1. Teaching Students with Complex Communication Needs: Instructional Design and Methods \nThis course will provide an overview of instructional practices that guide teaching and learning for \nstudents with complex communication needs. Upon completion of the course, the participants will be \nable to: \nAPC Item 5 - page 16\nNew Program Proposal – Comprehensive Review 12 \nCertificate/Diploma/Non-credential Programs  \n• Describe principles of Universal Design for Learning and explain how they relate to pedagogy, goal \nwriting, accommodations, and modifications for students with complex communication needs. \n• Identify specific collaborative teaching and team teaching approaches that support inclusive \neducation for students with complex communication needs. \n• Identify assessment practices and tools that are appropriate for students with complex \ncommunication needs. \n• Identify evidence-based approaches to instruction for students with complex communication needs \nand describe their application across different instructional contexts.  \n• Use Programs of Study/Standards to guide goal setting and instruction. \n2. Teaching Students with Complex Communication Needs: Augmentative and Alternative \nCommunication \nThis course will introduce classroom teachers and educational professionals to the practices, issues and \nimportance of providing augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) strategies and supports to \nstudents with complex communication needs. Upon completion of this course, the participants will be \nable to:  \n• Understand approaches to assessment of communication abilities in non-verbal students. \n• Understand the importance of language and literacy for students with complex communication \nneeds. \n• Explore evidence-based practices that can support AAC in the classroom. \n• Explore best practices in implementation of AAC in the classroom.  \n• Understand the issues around providing appropriate AAC for students and youth, including \nvocabulary selection, access, roles of communication partners, and creating an environment to \nsupport communication. \n• Explore technological devices that are used to provide voice output for children and youth with \ncomplex communication needs. \n• Explore and discuss how the tablet technologies and apps have impacted the world of AAC. \n• Explore common AAC practices such as Picture Exchange Communication Systems (PECS), \nPragmatic Organisation Dynamic Display (PODD), Aided Language Stimulation, Communication \nand Language Board Displays, and others based on student interests. \n3. Teaching Students with Complex Communication Needs: Emergent Literacy \nThis course will focus on high quality, comprehensive emergent literacy instruction for students with \ncomplex communication needs. The course will emphasize the use of symbol supported communication \nsystems and intentionally designed instruction that includes daily opportunities for developing \ncommunication and interaction skills, oral language understandings, alphabet knowledge and \nphonological awareness, understandings of concepts about print, and a positive disposition toward \nliteracy. Upon completion of this course educators will be able to: \n• Identify the principles of effective instruction that apply to emergent literacy \n• Identify learners who are emerging in their understandings of literacy regardless of age or other \nindividual characteristics \n• Describe the concurrent and interrelated relationship in the development of speaking, listening, \nreading and writing \n• Create a comprehensive instructional plan that fosters communication and literacy development for \nemergent readers and writers with complex communication needs.  \n• Identify and implement technologies, media, and materials that can positively impact emergent \nliteracy development and demonstrations.  \n4.

The course will emphasize the use of symbol and text based communication \nsystems and systematically designed instruction that includes daily opportunities for developing \nconventional skills in word reading (decoding and automatic word identification), text comprehension, \nsilent reading fluency, and writing. Upon completion of this course, the participants will be able to: \n• Understand the principles of effective, comprehensive, conventional reading and writing instruction.  \nAPC Item 5 - page 17\nNew Program Proposal – Comprehensive Review 13 \nCertificate/Diploma/Non-credential Programs  \n• Identify learners who are most likely to benefit from comprehensive, conventional reading and \nwriting instruction. \n• Describe how to support learning and use of AAC systems throughout conventional literacy \ninstruction. \n• Design specific lessons that address word reading, comprehension, silent reading fluency, and \nwriting for students with complex communication needs.  \n• Determine appropriate tools for individual students with complex motor impairments to use when \ngenerating text during instruction in the cognitive acts of writing. \n• Create a comprehensive instructional plan that fosters communication and conventional literacy \ndevelopment for students with complex communication needs.  \n• Use technologies, media, and materials that can positively impact conventional literacy \ndevelopment and demonstrations.  \n• Identify assessment approaches that are accessible and effective for students with complex \ncommunication needs. \n5. Teaching Students with Complex Communication Needs: Numeracy  \nThis course focuses on quality instruction in mathematics (including numeracy) and how it can be made \naccessible to students with complex communication needs. The course will emphasize the use of \nsymbol and text based augmentative and alternative communication systems, accessible instructional \nmaterials, and systematically designed instruction to support understandings of number sense; spatial \nreasoning; principles of geometry, measurement, data, and analytic procedures; and mathematical \nproblem solving including algebra. Upon completion of this course, the participants will be able to:  \n• Create an instructional environment that supports the learning of mathematics for students with \nCCN in order to foster conceptual mathematics understanding, application, and enjoyment. \n• Select and design mathematics tasks and tools that promote inquiry and problem solving, yet are \naccessible to students with CCN who often have co-occurring physical impairments. \n• Describe the importance of multiple means of representation in teaching mathematical thinking and \nproblem solving.  \n• With specific attention to the needs of students with complex communication needs describe \nprocesses for:  \no developing number sense.  \no teaching counting and cardinality  \no teaching calculation (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division). \no teaching measurement \no developing an understanding of basic geometric shapes and their attributes. \n• Create a comprehensive instructional plan that fosters communication and the development of \nmathematics skills and understandings.  \n5.4.2 Describe the consultative process with employers, industry/professional bodies or advisory groups that \nhelped formulate these learning outcomes. \nThe outcomes for the TSCCN program were developed in consultation with experts in the field of special \neducation, augmentative and alternative communication, and literacy. In specific, the program was developed in \ncollaboration with the Center for Literacy & Disability Studies, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (see the \nattached letter of support). \n5.4.3 Provide evidence of alignment/compliance with regulatory, industry, program accreditation and \nprofessional accreditation standards relevant to the program. \nNot applicable \nAPC Item 5 - page 18\nNew Program Proposal – Comprehensive Review 14 \nCertificate/Diploma/Non-credential Programs  \n5.5  Institutional Quality Assurance     \n5.5.1 Describe the criteria and methods for evaluating the success of the program and achieving continuous \nquality improvement.  Include expected outcomes, key performance indicators and performance targets \nfor the program.   \n1. Upon entry to the program, all students will be asked to complete a series of questionnaires assessing \ntheir (a) orientation to special education, (b) knowledge of universal design for learning and AAC, (c) \nknowledge of literacy and numeracy constructs, and (d) self-efficacy as special education teachers.  \n2. After every course, the students will complete the regular university online USRI evaluation forms. \n3. After every course, the students will complete a customized feedback form inquiring what aspects of the \ncourse were most useful in improving their instructional practice, what aspects we less useful, and \nadditional content they would like to see included in the course.  \n4. At the end of the program, all students will be asked to complete the same questionnaires as in the \nbeginning of the program.  \n5. Once a year, a program advisory committee (described in greater detail in 5.5.2) will examine the impact \nof the program, student feedback, evaluation results, and recommend changes when and where \nneeded.  \n5.5.2 Indicate whether a program advisory committee is planned or in place and, if so, comment on the role of \nthe committee in program quality assurance.  \nProgram advisory committee will consist of the Director of the JP Das Centre, the Director of Center for Literacy \nand Disability Studies, the Chair (or designate) of the Department of Educational Psychology, the Dean (or \ndesignate) of the Faculty of Education at the University of Alberta, and one representative of course instructors. \nThe committee task is to examine the impact of the program, student feedback, student evaluation results, and \nrecommend changes when and where needed. \nRECOMMENDATION (FOR DEPARTMENT USE) \nDo Any Issues or Information Gaps Remain? \nRecommendation(s) \nReviewer(s) \nDate Completed \nAPC Item 5 - page 19\nAPC Item 5 - page 20\nCASS \nOffice: #1200, 9925 – 109 Street, Edmonton, Alberta T5K 2J8 \nPhone: (780) 451-7106    FAX: (780) 482-5659    E-mail: barry.litun@cass.ab.ca   Website: www.cass.ab.ca \nCOLLEGE OF ALBERTA SCHOOL SUPERINTENDENTS \nApril 14, 2016 \nDr. Randy Wimmer, Interim Dean of Education \nUniversity of Alberta \n845 Education S \n11210 - 87 Ave. \nEdmonton, AB T6G 2G5 \nEmail – rwimmer@ualberta.ca \nDear Dr. Wimmer:  \nOn behalf of the College of Alberta School Superintendents (CASS), I am writing in support of \nyour proposed University Certificate in Teaching Students with Complex Communication Needs.  \nThe recommendation is based on information and recommendation I have received from Dr. \nDianne McConnell, who chairs the CASS Inclusive Education Committee. Dr. McConnell \nbelieves the program would be instrumental in developing capacity of Alberta teachers, enabling \nthem to support students that are among the most disadvantaged in our schools. \nThe certificate program supports Goal 1 of the current CASS Strategic Plan, which states \nAdvocacy for Students is Ongoing and Courageous. The program addresses two objectives \nwithin the goal, specifically: \na) Champion research on educational matters to help inform policy, decision-making, and \npractice across Alberta’s education system; and \nb) Forge strategic alliances to support and enhance the use of research as a tool to \nimprove student engagement, learning, and achievement. \nOne of the most powerful factors in supporting success for every student, including those with \nunique learning needs, is a knowledgeable and skilled teacher in the classroom. The Certificate \nin Teaching Students with Complex Communication Needs will play an important role in \nensuring that students across the province have access to teachers who are skilled at \nsupporting communication, language, literacy and numeracy.  I appreciate the work you and \nyour colleagues are doing to improve the pedagogy of Alberta teachers.  \nSincerely,  \nBarry Litun \nExecutive Director \nCc: John Waterhouse, CASS President 2015/16 \n Dr. Dianne McConnell, Chair CASS Inclusive Education Committee \nAPC Item 5 - page 21\nmailto:rwimmer@ualberta.ca\n~h Alberta ~ ~V~aS~ID\nTeachers’ Association ~ir~j~t ~a~e~uat~e\n191% Robert J Twerdoclib Sharon L Vogrinetz\n11010 142 Street NW, Edmonton, Alberta T5N 2R1 Vice-President Assistant Executive Secretary\nCarol D HendersonT 780-447-9400 or 18002327208 Past President\nF 780-455-6481\nwww.teachers.ab.ca\n2016 05 09\nDr Lynn McGarvey\nProfessor and Vice Dean\n845 Education South\nFa~’uI~ of Fducation\nUniversity of Alberta\nEdmonton AB T6G 2G5\nDear Dr McGarvey\nRe University Certificate (Undergraduate) in Teaching Students with Complex\nCommunication Needs\nPlease accept this short correspondence indicating the profession’s support for the new\nUniversity Certificate (Undergraduate) in Teaching Students with Complex Communication\nNeeds.

As the Director of the Center for Literacy and Disability Studies at the University \nof North Carolina at Chapel Hill, I understand the significant need for such a program and \nlook forward to working with you to develop and implement the program.   \nIn the summer of 2015, my colleague, David Koppenhaver and I taught a weeklong \nintensive seminar in literacy and complex communication needs at the University of Alberta.  \nWe extended the capacity for the course two times in order to begin to address the need \nacross the province. Even with an enrollment exceeding 60, we barely scratched the surface \nof interest and need.  The proposed certificate program has the potential to much more \neffectively address the need as the online format will dramatically increase the number of \npre-service and in-service educators who can participate.  \nAs a partner on this project, we are excited to work with faculty and staff at the University of \nAlberta to create the content for the courses in literacy and numeracy.  We have already been \nactively engaged in conceptualizing the program and developing initial course syllabi. As the \nprogram moves forward, we look forward to more work creating the courses themselves and \nteaching them when the program launches.   \nAll the best as you process the program proposal.  \nSincerely,  \nKaren A.

We understand that you are currently at \nthe stage of seeking University approval for this certificate.  \nWe are very supportive of providing this opportunity for teachers and other \nprofessionals as we know that we have many children and youth in our regions who \nrequire intensive support to have their communication needs meet through the use of \naugmentative and alternative communication. To support the needs of these children \nand youth, teachers require very specialized training and we understand that this course \nwork will support our teachers in developing those skills. \nWe were very pleased to hear that this course work is to be delivered online. As a \nnumber of our RCSDs are rural, professional will have equal access from across the \nprovince to complete this certificate. \nIn conclusion, we agree that this certification program is need to meet the needs of our \nchildren and youth. \nSincerely; \nSandra Zesko   Cathy Gukert \nAspen Collaborative   Central Alberta \nDenis Potvin    Terry Ramsay \nEastern Edge   Edmonton \nPatti Hill    Vicki Cooke \nLeduc and Area   St. Albert/Sturgeon \nParkland, Evergreen and Area \nAPC Item 5 - page 25\nTo whom it may concern, \nThis letter is to express our Northern Lakes Collaborative Services (NLCS) Regional                       \nCollaborative Services Delivery (RCSD) regional support for the development of the Teaching                       \nStudents with Complex Communication Needs (CCN) certificate.   \nAs a Northern Alberta RCSD region we see great need for and demand for this certificate now                                 \nand in the future. While the focus is on teachers, there is no doubt that Speech­Language                               \nPathologists, Occupational Therapists and other members of interdisciplinary teams will also be                       \ninterested in the certificate. The certificate could also lead to an MEd in Special (Inclusive)                             \nEducation, which may be of interest to some educators. \nWith the advent of RCSD regions were asked to build capacity within schools, families and                             \ncommunities and create resources to successfully support children and youth with CCN. Out of                           \nall low­incidence needs CCN is the one with the highest population numbers and it is a                               \nchallenge to provide adequate services to this population. \nAlthough there is great intent in following this request and also a growing recognition of the                               \nnumbers of children and youth who have complex communication needs (CCN) this is a very                             \nchallenging, time consuming and at times frustrating task especially for regions that are remote                           \nand have minimal resources at their fingertips. A lack of training and support for teachers who                               \nhave these children and youths in their classrooms and/or for teachers whose work involved                           \nsupporting classroom teachers (Learning Support Teachers, Special Educators, etc.) is one of                       \nmany barriers. Having access to online trainings such as this certificate will allow teachers and                             \nservice providers from across Alberta to obtain this important, yet very difficult to find, training. \nTeachers and service providers in Alberta and other provinces currently do not get the                           \nspecialized training needed to provide quality instruction, consultative services and supports to                       \nchildren and youth with CCN in their current university programs. Children and youth with CCN                             \nprovide unique challenges to educators and service providers as they do not have the oral                             \nlanguage abilities that are often taken for granted by educators. Their educational needs are                           \nfurther complicated by their needs for augmentative and alternative communication (AAC)                     \ndevices and supports. \nWhile AAC has been understood to be the domain of Speech Language Pathologists (see SAC                             \nposition paper for more information         \n(​http://www.sac­oac.ca/professional­resources/resource­library/sac­position­paper­role­speech­l\nanguage­pathologists­respect ) current research suggests the role of the teacher is critical in                         \neducational success of students with CCN (Beukelman & Mirenda, 2013; Loncke, 2014; Soto &                           \nZangari, 2009). And although AAC is an area targeted by Speech­language Pathologists, most                         \nAPC Item 5 - page 26\nhttp://www.sac-oac.ca/professional-resources/resource-library/sac-position-paper-role-speech-language-pathologists-respect\nhttp://www.sac-oac.ca/professional-resources/resource-library/sac-position-paper-role-speech-language-pathologists-respect\ngraduates would make use and benefit of a CCN certificate. During recent job interviews it was                               \nthe number one area being identified by graduating students that they would like to learn more                               \nabout and would like to have access to additional mentoring to best be able to support the                                 \nchildren and youth on their caseloads. \nIn Alberta, speech and language services in schools are primarily consultative in nature, leaving                           \nthe teacher and educational assistants to implement not only educational supports for students                         \nwith CCN but also AAC supports. In order to do so, teachers require the specialized training that                                 \na certificate such as the one under development by the University of Alberta and University of                               \nNorth Carolina at Chapel Hill. \nThere has been tremendous uptake by teachers and service providers across the province in                           \nin­service training that is being offered at both the provincial and regional level. This uptake                             \nsuggests a great untapped demand for knowledge and skills in this area. \nBest regards, \nKatrin Sannig, R.SLP \nRegional Manager, NLCS \nksannig@hpsd.ca \n780­552­3774 \nAPC Item 5 - page 27\nmailto:ksannig@hpsd.ca\nDonna Balas \nRegional Manager, \n Southeast Regional Collaborative Service Delivery \n58 Saamis Close SW \nMedicine Hat, Alberta \n403-866-3032 \ndonnabalas@me.com \nVIA EMAIL: rauno.parrila@ualberta.ca \nSeptember9, 2016 \nDr. Rauno Parrila \nDirector, Das Centre \nDepartment of Educational Psychology \n6-102 Education North \nUniversity of Alberta  \nEdmonton, AB T6G 2G5 \nDear Dr. Parrila \nOn behalf of the Southeast RCSD Leadership Team, I am writing to express our support for the development \nof a graduate certificate program focusing on teaching students with complex communication needs (CCN). \nThis letter received the unanimous support of our Leadership Team at our meeting on September 9, 2016.  \nOur Southeast region is fortunate to have the support of an AADL Level 3 Service Centre through partnership \nwith the SW RCSD and Alberta Health Services.  This service has meant that children and youth have access \nto assessment services and trial devices locally rather than travelling to Alberta Children’s Hospital in \nCalgary.  There have been increases in the use of low-tech (ex. PODD books), mid-tech  and high-tech (ex. \nNova chat)) devices. Over the past two years, we have moved from a caseload of about 10 children to \nserving over 40 in 2015-16. The numbers continue to grow as we expand our identification and \nunderstanding of the needs of children with CCN. The increasing number of identified children and youth \nusing communication devices in classrooms has meant that front-line professionals need to increase their \nknowledge of alternative communication systems and their implementation in school, home, and \ncommunity environments.   \nOur SE  RCSD has provided funds for professional development of teachers and SLPs in this area. The 5 day \ncourse in Edmonton with Dr. Karen Erickson and David Koppenhaver in July 2015, was funded by RCSD and \nhad great impact in expanding our understanding of CCN, in pockets. We need to continue professional \nAPC Item 5 - page 28\nmailto:rauno.parrila@ualberta.ca\ndevelopment and continue to expand our understanding of the communication and educational needs of \nthis population across our region.  \nFor the past two years, the Province-wide Low Incidence Team has offered a summer symposium in \nLethbridge with one of the sessions focused on complex communication.  In both years, the complex \ncommunication session has been well attended by teachers, educational assistants, and health professionals \nseeking to increase their ability to support students using AAC.  \nWe are very interested in the development of a certificate program that would be available to both \neducation and health professionals, especially given the option for distance/virtual delivery.  Not unlike \nother rural communities in the province, finding a way to release staff to attend courses in Edmonton is \nchallenging.  The development of an online certificate program available through the University of Alberta is \na tremendous opportunity for our professionals working and living in Southeast Alberta communities.  \nWe look forward to hearing more about the program once approved through the University processes.  \nSincerely, \nDonna Balas \nRegional Manager \ncc.

We are mandated by the provincial government to work \ncollaboratively across levels and systems and share our collective, limited resources and expertise as we \nsupport over 400 children and youth with complex learning and communication needs in the Calgary \narea. \nWe work closely with our partners to learn about and adopt consistent communication methods and \ntools across systems.  In April we hosted a professional education day which focused on teaching \nmethods for emergent literacy learners using aided language systems.  Our partnership also developed \nan information prescription on complex communication for families and care providers to access vetted \nresources and first-hand accounts from children, families and care providers working through complex \ncommunication challenges.   \nWhile research suggests the role of the teacher is critical in the educational success of students with \ncomplex communications needs, we know t collaborative approach is well received by children and \nyouth, families and their ‘wrap around team’ members.  In Alberta, speech and language services in \nschools are primarily consultative in nature, leaving the teacher and educational assistants to implement \nnot only educational supports for students with complex learning needs, but also augmentative and \nalternative communication (ACC) devices and supports. \nWe are continually exploring ways to build system capacity and sharing opportunities with our partners, \nand are very interested in the development of a distance education certificate program that could be \nmade available to all of our partners.  Such an approach supports our collaborative approach in working \nwith our children and youth as they learn to communicate with family, peers, and teachers in class, \ncommunity and home environments. \nAPC Item 5 - page 31\nmailto:rauno.parrila@ualberta.ca\nBeing able to access this specialized curriculum online will be well received by our partners who are \noften separated by geography, program, system, and schedule.

Post-Secondary Learning Act (PSLA): The PSLA gives GFC \nresponsibility, subject to the authority of the Board of Governors, over \nacademic affairs (Section 26(1)). Further, the PSLA gives the Board of \nGovernors authority over certain admission requirements and rules \nrespecting enrolment (Section 60(1)(c) and (d)). The Board has \ndelegated its authority over admissions requirements and rules \nrespecting enrolment to GFC. GFC has thus established an Academic \nStandards Committee (ASC).  \n2. PSLA: GFC may make recommendations to the Board of Governors \non a number of matters including the budget and academic planning \n(Section 26(1)(o)). GFC delegates its power to recommend to the Board \non the budget and on new or revised academic programs to the GFC \nAcademic Planning Committee (APC).  \n3. PSLA: The PSLA gives Faculty Councils power to “provide for the \nadmission of students to the faculty” (29(1)(c)).  \n4. PSLA: The PSLA gives Faculty Councils the authority to “determine \nthe programs of study for which the faculty is established” (Section \n29(1)(a)); to “provide for the admission of students to the faculty” \n(Section 29(1)(c)); and to “determine the conditions under which a \nstudent must withdraw from or may continue the student’s program of \nstudies in a faculty” (Section 29(1)(d)).  \n5. UAPPOL Admissions Policy: “Admission to the University of Alberta \nis based on documented academic criteria established by individual \nFaculties and approved by GFC. This criteria may be defined in areas \nsuch as subject requirements, minimum entrance averages, and \nlanguage proficiency requirements. In addition to academic requirements \nfor admission, GFC authorizes each Faculty to establish such other \nreasonable criteria for admission of applicants as the Faculty may \nconsider appropriate to its programs of study, subject to the approval of \nGFC (e.g. interview, audition, portfolio, etc.) The admission requirements \nfor any Faculty will be those approved by GFC as set forth in the current \nedition of the University Calendar. In addition to the admission \nAPC Item 6 - page 2\nItem No. 6 \nGFC ACADEMIC PLANNING COMMITTEE \nFor the Meeting of December 14, 2016 \nrequirements, selection criteria for quota programs, where they exist, will \nalso be published in the current edition of the University Calendar. The \nresponsibility for admission decisions will be vested in the Faculty \nAdmission Committees or in the Deans of the respective Faculties, as \nthe councils of such Faculties will determine.”  \n6. UAPPOL Admissions Procedure:  \n“PROCEDURE 1. EFFECTIVE DATE OF CHANGES TO ADMISSION \nREGULATIONS \n Following approval by GFC: a. Where changes to admission regulations \nmay disadvantage students in the current admission cycle, normally \nimplementation will be effective after the change has been published in \nthe University Calendar for one full year (i.e., effective the second year \nthat the information is published in the University Calendar). […]  \nb. Where changes to admission regulations are deemed by the \napproving body to be “advantageous to students”, normally the date of \nimplementation will be effective immediately or at the next available \nintake for the admitting Faculty.”  \n7. UAPPOL Academic Standing Policy: “All current academic standing \nregulations, including academic standing categories, University \ngraduating standards and requirements for all individual programs will be \nthose prescribed by Faculty Councils and GFC as set forth in the \nUniversity Calendar.”  \n8. UAPPOL Academic Standing Regulations Procedures: “All \nproposed new academic standing regulations and changes to existing \nacademic standing regulations will be submitted by the Faculties or the \nAdministration to the Provost and Vice-President (Academic). Faculties \nwill also submit to the Provost and Vice-President (Academic) any \nproposed changes to the use and/or computation of averages relating to \nacademic standing, including promotion and graduation. \n9. GFC Academic Standards Committee (ASC) Terms of Reference \n(3. Mandate):  \n“B. Admission and Transfer, Academic Standing […] \ni. All proposals from the Faculties or Administration related to admission \nand transfer, to the academic standing of students […] are submitted to \nthe Provost and Vice-President (Academic)(or delegate) who chairs the \nGFC Academic Standards Committee.

Statement indicating completion of departmental and/or Faculty approval processes. \nThis proposal went through both the Department of Financial and Statistical Analysis and the Department of \nAccounting, Operations and Information Systems in the Fall of 2015 and was approved by both Departments. It \nwas submitted to the Faculty of Business Undergraduate Studies Policy (USPC) Committee on January 14, \n2016, and approved at that time. It then went to Faculty of Business Council on January 27, 2016, and was \napproved. The initial approval was for a change of name to an existing Honors program. University \nGovernance advised that the change of name was not the appropriate pathway to create the new program and \nso the new program was resubmitted to USPC on September 23, 2016 and approved. It was submitted to \nBusiness Council on September 28, 2016 and approved. \n8. Attach proposed Calendar program and/or course changes. \nAttached as Appendix B. \n9.

What is the rationale for the program proposal? \nWhen the Honors program in Management Science was first created in 2003, the academic area of \nManagement Science was located within the Department of Finance and Management Science. This area was \nalways a mixture of academics primarily involved in Statistics and those primarily involved in Operations \nManagement. The Honors program in Management Science had always followed the general course \nrequirements for the Operations Management Major, with the addition of some additional Honors program \nrequirements. There never was a Management Science major. \nIn 2011, the Management Science group split into two, with the Operations Management group moving to the \nnewly re-named Department of Accounting, Operations and Information Systems. Responsibility for the \nOperations Management major also moved to the new Department. \nUntil the fall of 2015, there had never been a student in the Honors program in Management Science. The \nprogram had not been looked at in some time and the inconsistency inherent in its title was not noticed. \nHowever, when the student applied to the program, it became apparent that her interest was in Operations \nManagement and that the academic staff member most able to supervise the program was in Operations \nManagement. The courses already required were mainly Operations Management courses, and only a small \namount of adjustment was needed to create an enriched program for this student. Both Departments involved \nreadily agreed that the name change made sense and that the Honors program should be renamed and \nhoused in the same Department that housed Operations Management. \nIt is difficult to compare this nomenclature as Honors programs are not common in Undergraduate Business \ndegrees. But the subject matter of the program is well accepted throughout Canada as “Operations \nManagement”. \n11.  Provide the expected enrolment (or other) impact on the academic unit(s) offering the program and other \naffected units if applicable. Include information on the current enrolment.  \nThere is expected to be only minimal impact on the Department given that it is anticipated that the number of \nstudents in this program will always remain small. There is currently 1 student in the Honors program in \nmanagement Science who will be transferred to the Honors program in Operations Management if this \nproposal is approved. It is likely that the program would attract only one new student per year entering into \nYear Three, and a total of two students at steady state which is well within the capacity of the Department. \n12.  Do you anticipate an enrolment (or other) impact on programs at other institutions or regulatory bodies?  \nDescribe any consultations that have occurred with other institutions and professional organizations. \nThe new program is not expected to have any adverse effects or impact on any external stakeholders. \nEmployers are substantially more familiar with the title “Operations Management” than they are with \nManagement Science. Other post-secondary institutions that might consider a graduate from an Honors \nprogram for graduate work will be very familiar with this terminology and it will more accurately describe the \nstudent’s program. There have been no consultations with any external organizations. \n13.  Are there any resource implications (budget, information technology (IT), library (Library Impact Statement), \nlaboratory, space, student services, administrative services (eg, FGSR, Registrar’s Office, or IST), as \napplicable) for the proposed change? If so, please provide detail and evidence of consultation with affected \nunit(s) and/or appropriate University officers/committees. \nThe new program is not expected to have any major effects on any relevant units within the University of \nAlberta. There may be a minor impact on the Office of the Registrar. There will be no resource implications for \nany unit. The Registrar’s Office has reviewed the material and has no concerns. \nThe only impact on students will be on the single student currently in the program. We are requesting that this \nbe implemented for January 2017 to allow this single student to graduate with this designation. There has \nnever been another student in the program. One of the student members on USPC is an Operations \nManagement major and declared herself “very excited” by this change, feeling it would make the area more \nrelevant to students.\nAPC Item 6 - page 6\nAppendix A– Sample Enrolment Table  \nProposed Enrolment 2016-17 2017-18 2018-19 2019-20 \nAnnual \nOngoing \n• Total Full-Time head count 1 1 2 2 2 \n• Full-Time Year 1 0 0 0 0 0 \n• Full-Time Year 2 0 0 0 0 0 \n• Full-Time Year 3 0 1 1 1 1 \n• Full-Time Year 4 1 0 1 1 1 \n• Total Part-Time head count 0 0 0 0 0 \n• Part-Time Year 1 0 0 0 0 0 \n• Part-Time Year 2 0 0 0 0 0 \n• Part-Time Year 3 0 0 0 0 0 \n• Part-Time Year 4 0 0 0 0 0 \n• Total Work Experience hc 0 0 0 0 0 \n• Work Experience Year 1 0 0 0 0 0 \n• Work Experience Year 2 0 0 0 0 0 \n• Work Experience Year 3 0 0 0 0 0 \n• Work Experience Year 4 0 0 0 0 0 \n• Anticipated Number of \nGraduates \n1 1 1 1 1 \nAPC Item 6 - page 7\nThis agenda and its corresponding attachments are transitory records.

Rationale for the change (for example, changes in industry and/or post-secondary system \nnorms for nomenclature, in technology, in curriculum, etc.).  Include a survey of current \nnomenclature for similar programs offered across Campus Alberta and, where relevant, \nfurther afield. \nInnovation has become much more of a central part to what is meant by \n“Entrepreneurship”. Emphasizing innovation is more reflective of changes in scholarship \nand practice in the area of entrepreneurship. In recent years, student interest in \nentrepreneurship and innovation has grown dramatically. This has dovetailed with key \nstrategic initiatives of the School of Business to bolster our curricular and co-curricular \nofferings in entrepreneurship and innovation. This includes our launch of entrepreneurship \nHUB (eHUB) last year.  \nWe also have aggressively sought to build out our entrepreneurship and innovation \nofferings to serve the broader campus. eHUB is now supported by Central administration \nand we service students from faculties across campus (arts, science, medicine, ALES, \nengineering etc.). We have also launched cross-campus student courses -- entrepreneurship \n101 -- and this coming year, women's entrepreneurship. While students interested in family \nenterprise will still be able to take family business courses in the context of our proposed \nAPC Item 7 - page 3\nrevised major, the revised major will better reflect the demands of students and more \nproperly signal the content of what we aim to deliver through our curricular and co-\ncurricular suite of initiatives.  \nStudents members in the Faculty of Business Faculty Council spoke and voted in favour of \nthis change. \nThe University of Calgary calls its concentration in this area “Entrepreneurship and \nInnovation”. Mount Royal University has an “Innovation and Entrepreneurship” minor. \nMacEwan and Lethbridge Universities both teach entrepreneurial courses that emphasize \ninnovation. \n4. Impacts on students (active, stop-outs, graduates) and plans to ameliorate these impacts.  \nInclude evidence of consultation with students, as well as plans to allow active students the \nopportunity to graduate with the established credential (should they wish), and plans to deal \nwith graduates of the program coming forward to request an exchange of their credential \nfor the new. \nThere is almost no adverse effect on students. There is no change to the content of the \nmajor. Any student currently in the program with the existing name will be permitted the \nchoice of whether to graduate with the existing named major or take the new name until \n2020. As of August 2016, there are 26 students in the major, and so it will be possible to \nindividually counsel all of them if there are any concerns. Note that students have been \nreported under the Business specialisation (BUS) to present. \n5. Provide evidence of consultation with relevant external stakeholders, for instance \nemployers, professional/regulatory organizations or other post-secondary institutions.  \nIdentify anticipated impacts on stakeholder groups (if any) and outline plans to ameliorate \nimpacts. \nThis proposal was developed in consultation with the Centre for Entrepreneurship and \nFamily Enterprise, eHUB, and the Alberta Business Family Institute. The name change is \nnot expected to have any adverse effects or impact on any external stakeholders. \n6. Identify anticipated impacts on relevant units within the institution (e.g. Registrar’s Office, \nCommunications) and summarize the implications of the proposed change for institutional \nresources. \nThe name change is not expected to have any major effects on any relevant units within the \nUniversity of Alberta. There may be a minor impact on the Office of the Registrar. There \nwill be no resource implications for any unit. \nAPC Item 7 - page 4\n1 \nFaculty of Business \nBachelor of Commerce \nCalendar Change Request Form \nDepartment:   Strategic Management and Organization \nImplementation: Normal (effective 2017-2018)    XX  Early _______ \nType of Change: Course Deletion ____   Course Change ____   New Course ____ \n   Major Change   XX  New Major      ____   Program Change  ___ \n    Calendar Change (Other)  ____ \nCURRENT PROPOSED \nMajor in Entrepreneurship and Family \nEnterprise [Business]   \nMajor in Entrepreneurship \nand Innovation [Business] \nDescription of Field \n    Entrepreneurial activity is vital to \neconomic development and societal well-\nbeing.

Two streams are available—\nthe general entrepreneurship stream and the \nfamily enterprise stream. Depending upon \ntheir emphasis, students will learn how to: \n(1)Identify and evaluate business \nopportunities, mobilize resources, and create \nan organization; \n(2)Manage the transition from an \nentrepreneurial start-up to a more complex \nbusiness entity; \n(3)Interact with family enterprises more \nDescription of Field \nEntrepreneurship and innovation are vital to \neconomic development, wealth creation, and \nsocietal well-being.

If \nthey will be advising family enterprises \ninternationally: Add SMO 442 and 435. \nRationale: In recent years, student interest in entrepreneurship and innovation has grown \ndramatically. This has dovetailed with key strategic initiatives of the School of Business to \nbolster our curricular and co-curricular offerings in entrepreneurship and innovation. This \nincludes our launch of entrepreneurship HUB (eHUB) last year. We also have aggressively \nsought to build out our entrepreneurship and innovation offerings to serve the broader \ncampus. eHUB is now supported by Central administration and we service students from \nfaculties across campus (arts, science, medicine, ALES, engineering etc.). We have also \nlaunched cross-campus student courses -- entrepreneurship 101 -- and this coming year, \nwomen's entrepreneurship. While students interested in family enterprise will still be able to \ntake family business courses in the context of our proposed revised major, the revised major \nwill better reflect the demands of students and more properly signal the content of what we \naim to deliver through our curricular and co-curricular suite of initiatives. \nThis proposal eliminates the separate stream for Family Enterprise and simplifies the overall \nrequirements. \nSubmitted By:  Yoni Reshef, Chair SMO    Date:  January 14, 2016 \nDepartment Chair:  _______________________________  Date:  ______________ \n    (signature) \nAPC Item 7 - page 10\nItem No. 8 \nGFC ACADEMIC PLANNING COMMITTEE \nFor the Meeting of December 14, 2016 \nOUTLINE OF ISSUE \nAction Item \nAgenda Title: Proposal to Change the Name of the Major ‘Family Ecology to ‘Family Science’, in the  \nBachelor of Science in Human Ecology, Faculty of Agriculture, Life and Environmental Science \n(ALES). \nMotion:  THAT the GFC Academic Planning Committee approve, with delegated authority from General \nFaculties Council, the proposed name change of the major Family Ecology to Family Science in the Bachelor \nof Science in Human Ecology, as proposed by the Faculty of Agricultural, Life and Environmental Science, \nand as set for the in Attachment 1, to take effect upon final approval.  \nItem   \nAction Requested Approval Recommendation   \nProposed by Stanford Blade, Dean, Faculty of Agricultural, Life and Environmental \nSciences \nDeanna Williamson, Chair, Department of Human Ecology \nPresenter Rhonda Breitkreuz, Human Ecology Program Chair, Faculty of \nAgricultural, Life and Environmental Sciences  \nScott Jeffrey, Associate Dean Undergraduate,  Faculty of Agricultural, \nLife and Environmental Sciences \nDetails \nResponsibility Provost and Vice-President (Academic) \nThe Purpose of the Proposal is \n(please be specific) \nTo approve the proposed Program Name Change in the Bachelor of \nScience in Human Ecology, from the Family Ecology Major to the Family \nScience Major \nThe Impact of the Proposal is To align with the shift in the discipline of family ecology nomenclature as \nrecognized by the National Council of Family Relations.

Rationale for the change (for example, changes in industry and/or post-secondary system \nnorms for nomenclature, in technology, in curriculum, etc.).  Include a survey of current \nnomenclature for similar programs offered across Campus Alberta and, where relevant, \nfurther afield. \nIn 2015, the Department of Human Ecology Undergraduate Program Committee discussed \nthe merits of changing the name of the Family Ecology Major to the Family Science Major. \nIn March, 2016, the Department of Human Ecology Department Council approved this \nchange, in conjunction with recommendations for changes to the University of Alberta \nCalendar. \nThe impetus for this change came from discussions organized by the National Council of \nFamily Relations (NCFR). NCFR, established in 1938, is the organization developed to \ncatalyze research, theory, and practice related to families. It has 3200 members worldwide. \nAnnually, it organizes an international conference, and houses three top-tier family science \njournals. \nIn August 2014, NCFR published findings from a task force assigned with examining the \nfuture of the discipline of family science. One of the key issues that surfaced from task \nforce consultations and reviews was the concern about the “identity crisis” of the discipline \nof family science. One of the reasons identified for the difficulty in branding family science \nACP Item 8 - page 3\neffectively was the differences in names for departments and family related degrees: family \nstudies, human development, family ecology, family and human development, etc. \nThere is now convergence around the notion that “family science” is a name that should be \nused to promote common branding of the discipline. The term “family” is broad enough to \nencompass the key content of the discipline, and “science” denotes a scientifically rigorous \nand engaged scholarship within the discipline. Moreover, graduates of the major receive a \nBachelor of Science degree (BSc in Human Ecology).  In line with this thinking, Faculty \nMembers in the Human Ecology Department agree that it is time to change the name of our \nmajor to reflect the general shift in the discipline of family science as recognized by the \nNational Council of Family Relations. \n4. Impacts on students (active, stop-outs, graduates) and plans to ameliorate these impacts.  \nInclude evidence of consultation with students, as well as plans to allow active students the \nopportunity to graduate with the established credential (should they wish), and plans to deal \nwith graduates of the program coming forward to request an exchange of their credential \nfor the new. \nThere are no expected impacts on students as this is a simple name change. Once approved, \nstudents will be admitted into the Family Science Major and will graduate with that major.  \nStudents previously admitted will graduate from the Family Ecology Major (the major to \nwhich they were admitted).  Students in the Family Ecology Major who wish to graduate \nwith a Family Science Major will be permitted to transfer to the Family Science major. \nThere are no curricular changes resulting from the name change, so no students will be \ndisadvantaged by the change.  \nConsultations with students included: \n●  In March 2016, 25 students in a senior level Family Ecology course (HECOL \n440) were invited to discuss the proposed name change in class.  A few students \nnoted that that they saw the measure as enhancing the profile of the discipline in \nCanada. Nobody raised any objections. \n● In April 2016, an email was sent to all students in the Human Ecology program in \nApril 2016.  The email explained the proposed change and solicited student \nfeedback.  Of the 168 students who received the email, three replied with positive \nreactions.  There were no negative comments received.  \n● Students were present as voting members when the proposal was approved at \nmeetings of the Human Ecology Undergraduate Program Committee, the Human \nEcology Department Council, the ALES Faculty Council.  There were no \ndissenting votes or comments. \n● The Human Ecology Students Association, which represents the interests of all \nHuman Ecology students, was consulted and supports the change (see attached \nletter of support). \n5. Provide evidence of consultation with relevant external stakeholders, for instance \nemployers, professional/regulatory organizations or other post-secondary institutions.  \nACP Item 8 - page 4\nIdentify anticipated impacts on stakeholder groups (if any) and outline plans to ameliorate \nimpacts. \nNCFR discussions have involved stakeholder groups, including other post-secondary \ninstitutions, professional/regulatory bodies and employers.  There are no anticipated \nimpacts on stakeholder groups. \n6. Identify anticipated impacts on relevant units within the institution (e.g. Registrar’s Office, \nCommunications) and summarize the implications of the proposed change for institutional \nresources. \nThere will be limited impact on other units.  Minor coding changes for Campus Solutions \nwill be requested.  Recruitment literature is updated annually, so the name change will be \neasily adopted.  ALES will ensure that all sections of the Calendar that mention the major \nare updated. \nACP Item 8 - page 5\nAPPENDIX 1:  Proposed Calendar Change \ncurrent proposed \nBSc Human Ecology \n… \nNotes \n1.

The University is enriched by \ndiversity, and it welcomes and seeks to include many voices, including those that have been under-represented or \nexcluded.  \nThis policy is guided by the following principles:  \n1. Equity  \nEquity is about fairness: in access – to education, to employment – and in opportunity to succeed in these \ndomains. As a guiding principle of this policy, equity reflects an understanding that the University of Alberta is \nan increasingly diverse community and that it will respect and value the differences of its members.  \n2.

Academic Freedom  \nThe University of Alberta’s motto, Quaecumque Vera (whatsoever things are true) declares the University’s \ncommitment to academic freedom and freedom of speech. As an institution of higher learning and research, \nthe University is devoted to discovery, debate, difference of opinion, and the careful and public weighing of \nideas and actions. Members of the University have the right to pursue the truth in their research and \npublications, artistic creations, teaching, learning, service, and public debate. This includes the right to \nquestion and criticize the status quo. Academic freedom, however, is not without limits. It is not, for example, \na justification or license for discrimination or harassment or for preventing the lawful exercise of free speech. \nPurpose \nThe purpose of this policy is to foster and protect a respectful environment for work, study, and living that \nsupports the dignity and equality of equity for all members of the University of Alberta. This policy expresses the \nUniversity’s commitment to a work, study, and living environment that is free of discrimination and harassment, and \nit ensures that the University of Alberta will meet both its obligations under law and its ethical responsibilities as an \ninstitution of higher learning. These legal and ethical responsibilities include the duty to accommodate and the \nprovision of opportunities to persons who require accommodation based on a protected ground. \nPOLICY \n1.

When a complaint of discrimination or harassment is established, appropriate action is taken, \nregardless of the authority or seniority of the offender. Individuals who engage in harassing or discriminatory \nbehaviours may be subject to disciplinary action.  \nThe University has an overriding institutional interest in maintaining an environment free from discrimination \nand harassment and may therefore itself initiate an investigation, or become a complainant, or continue with a \ncomplaint withdrawn by a complainant. \nRetaliation or reprisal against a person who has made a complaint, or against witnesses to a complaint, are \nsimilarly prohibited. Individuals who engage in retaliation may be subject to disciplinary action. \nThe University also recognizes the serious nature of allegations of discrimination and harassment that are \nmade in bad faith, and it may take disciplinary action should allegations of discrimination or harassment be \nshown to be malicious, frivolous, fraudulent, or vexatious.

The University’s duty to \naccommodate is far-reaching.

Currently, T to justify a \npractice, standard, decision or rule as a BFR or BFOR, the University must demonstrate, on a balance of \nprobabilities, that the impugned practice, standard, decision or rule:  \na) was adopted for a rational purpose connected to the performance of the job or the provision of the \nservice;  \nb) was adopted in an honest and good faith belief that it was necessary to the fulfillment of the job or \nservice;  \nc) is reasonable and necessary to the fulfillment of the job or service.  \nTo show that the practice, standard, decision or rule is reasonable and necessary, the University must \ndemonstrate that accommodation of the employee or student would impose undue hardship on the University. \nProcedures on requesting and dealing with addressing accommodation issues are published under this policy \nand include examples of accommodation measures and assessingments of undue hardship. \n3.

It may \nbe an isolated act or repetitive conduct, but cannot be trifling. A reprisal or \nthreat of reprisal against an individual for rejecting a sexual solicitation or \nadvance may also constitute sexual harassment. \nAPC Item 9 - page 11\n U of A Policies and Procedures On-Line (UAPPOL) \nThe person(s) engaged in harassment need not have the intention to \nharass; it is the objective assessment of the circumstances that matters. \nHow would a reasonable observer perceive the situation? A complainant \nneed not expressly object to unwelcome conduct or comments, although \nany clear indication that the behaviour is unwanted will satisfy the test. A \ncomplainant's apparent passivity or failure to object overtly to sexual \nadvances does not necessarily signal consent or welcomed behaviour, \nespecially where a power imbalance exists between the individuals.  \nRacial Harassment involves unwanted or unwelcome comments, conduct \nor behavior that humiliates, intimidates, excludes or isolates an individual \nor group by focusing on their race, ethnicity, origin or religion. Overall, \nracial harassment undermines self-esteem and is a violation of the dignity \nand security of the individual or group(s) that it targets. \nDuty to Accommodate The duty to accommodate obligates the University to make reasonable \nadjustments, to the point of undue hardship or as required by law, to the \ndelivery of services (including teaching and the method of evaluation) and \nthe conditions of employment in order to reduce or eliminate the impact of \ndiscriminatory rules, policies, practices, standards, terms of employment, \nor decisions, which have an adverse impact on an individual or group of \nindividuals based on a characteristic or perceived characteristic referenced \nin the protected grounds.  \nAccommodation Accommodation is the process of making reasonable adjustments to the \ndelivery of services and the conditions of employment in order to alleviate \nany adverse impacts on persons that result from the application of reduce \nor eliminate the impact of discriminatory rules, policies, practices, \nstandards, terms of employment, or decisions, due to which have an \nadverse impact on an individual or group of individuals based on a \ncharacteristic or perceived characteristic referenced in the protected \ngrounds. Accommodation is a shared responsibility between the University \nand the individual in need of accommodation, and is assessed on the \nunique circumstances of each individual. The process requires reasonable \naccommodation, not instant or perfect accommodation. The recipients of \naccommodation (e.g. students, faculty and staff) may be required to try \ndifferent accommodation options. The University is required to provide \nreasonable accommodation up to the point of undue hardship.  \nAccommodation neither requires nor implies that the University lower its \nacademic or professional standards. Nor does accommodation relieve \nstudents of the responsibility to demonstrate the essential skills and \ncompetencies required by programs or staff of the responsibility to meet \nthe performance requirements of a position in which they are \naccommodated. \nBona fide requirement (BFR) / \nBona fide occupational \nrequirement (BFOR) \nA limitation on individual rights may be reasonable and justifiable if the \nUniversity can show that a discriminatory practice, standard, decision or \nrule is a “bona fide requirement” (BFR) or “bona fide occupational \nrequirement” (BFOR). To justify such a determination Currently, to \nestablish a BFR or BFOR, , the University must demonstrate, on a balance \nof probabilities, that the impugned practice, standard, decision or rule:  \na) was adopted for a rational purpose connected to the performance of \nthe job or the provision of the service;  \nb) was adopted in an honest and good faith belief that it was \nnecessary to the fulfillment of the job or service;  \nc) is reasonable and necessary to the fulfillment of the job or service.  \nProtected Grounds Discrimination is prohibited based on the following protected grounds:  \na) race  APC Item 9 - page 12\n U of A Policies and Procedures On-Line (UAPPOL) \nb) colour  \nc) ancestry  \nd) place of origin  \ne) religious beliefs  \nf) gender, gender identity and gender expression (including \npregnancy and gender identity) \ng) physical disability  \nh) mental disability  \ni) marital status  \nj) family status  \nk) source of income  \nl) sexual orientation  \nm) age  \nn) political beliefs;  \nor any other groups as amended from time to time.  \nUndue Hardship The University has a duty to take reasonable steps to accommodate \nindividual needs to the point of undue hardship. Undue hardship occurs \nwhen accommodation would create onerous conditions for the University.  \nWhile undue hardship will be decided in the circumstances of each case, \nonerous conditions may include, but are not limited to, the following.  \nWhen the proposed accommodation would: including but not limited to the \nfollowing, should be considered:  \na) pose  when there is a risk to the safety of others or a substantive \nrisk of personal injury to the person seeking accommodation, \nb) entail unreasonable financial cost such that a program or service \nwould cease to exist, or otherwise  be unreasonable for  the \nUniversity to bear the costs of accommodation,  \nc) effectively lower academic and/or when accommodation \nalternatives would result in lowering performance standards or \nresult in substantive job requirements being unmet,  \nd) unduly disrupt or interfere with when the accommodation would be \nunduly disruptive to an academic staff or collective agreement or \ncause substantial detrimental effects on other employees,  \ne) When an educational accommodation would result in essential \nelements of an educational service or program not being offered to \nother students, or cause a detrimental effect on other students. as \na result of accommodating an individual or a group of students.  \nAll students are bound by the Code of Student Behaviour.  \nInformal Resolution Informal resolutions are those that achieve remedies agreeable to \ncomplainants and respondents, but do not invoke formal resolution \nprocedures. Informal resolutions involve the relevant parties, and may \ninclude coaching, counseling, supporting, mediating, or otherwise \nfacilitating the resolution of the complaint. See procedures linked to this \nPolicy.  \nFormal Resolution Formal resolutions are effected through procedures described in the \nUniversity’s academic staff and collective agreements with AASUA and \nNASA, in the Code of Student Behaviour, in the Postdoctoral Fellows \nPolicy or in the procedures linked to the Discrimination, Harassment and \nDuty to Accommodate Policy.  \nRemedy The general purposes of a remedy are:  \na) to restore, as closely as possible, to a person whose complaint of \ndiscrimination or harassment has been sustained, the position she \nor he would have been in had the discrimination or harassment \nnot occurred; and  \nb) To prevent further acts of discrimination or harassment.  \n APC Item 9 - page 13\n U of A Policies and Procedures On-Line (UAPPOL) \nA remedy will be appropriate to the individual case and severity of the \nfinding of discrimination or harassment. It may include, but is not limited to, \nan apology, the creation of a policy, a promise or requirement to cease the \nbehaviour, or a transfer.  \nComplainant A complainant is a person who alleges s/he has experienced believes he \nor she has been a victim of discrimination and/or harassment and initiates \na complaint against a member of the University community or other \nindividual covered under this Policy. \nRespondent A respondent is a member of the University community who has been \naccused of discrimination or harassment by a complainant.  \nRELATED LINKS \nShould a link fail, please contact uappol@ualberta.ca.

Members of the University community, who would experience discrimination because of  a \ncharacteristic that falls w ithin a protected ground, have the right to be reasonably accommodated.   \nThe provision of  reasonable accommodations gives ef fect to the inherent dignity of  each individual and enables \nindividuals to equitably participate in those protected areas, including services related to post-secondary education. \nSome of  these services include, but are not limited to, participation in or access to course w ork, practicum and clinical \nplacements, co-op placements, employment, graduate internships, library services, athletic services, school teams, \ncafeteria services, parking and transport services, computing services, health services, counseling services and \nothers. The University is required to provide reasonable accommodation up to the point of  undue hardship, except in \ncases w here the  University can show  that the discriminatory practice, standard, decision or rule is a “bona fide \nrequirement” (BFR) or a “bona fide occupational requirement” (BFOR). Examples of  accommodation measures \nand assessing undue hardship information can be found in a link at the end of  this procedure. \nPurpose \nAccommodation enables equitable participation in the areas of  employment, tenancy, education, and access to \nother goods and services. \nAccommodation should be provided in a manner that respects the dignity of  the individual, meets the needs of  that \nparticular individual, promotes integration and full participation, and respects conf identiality. \nAcademic accommodation aims to ensure that members of  the University community w ho w ould experience \ndiscrimination based on any of  the protected grounds have reasonably equal access to services provided by post-\nsecondary education. These services include but are not limited to course w ork, practicum and clinical placements, \nco-op placements, graduate internships, library services, athletic services, school teams, cafeteria services, parking \nand transport services, computing services, health services, counseling services and others. \nThe University is required to provide accommodation up to the point of  undue hardship.  \nThe purpose of  this procedure is to set out: \nAPC Item 9 - page 21\n U of A Policies and Procedures On-Line (UAPPOL) \n● the general responsibilit ies that various University units have to fulf il the duty to accommodate  \n● the process to request and implement reasonable accommodations and the more specif ic responsibilities that \neach party has in the search for reasonable accommodations \n● the appeal process in the event there is an alleged failure to reasonably accommodate a member of  the \nUniversity community \n● information related to privacy and document retention.  \nPROCEDURE \nGENERAL RESPONSIBILITIES \nThe duty to accommodate is an institutional obligation and a shared responsibility betw een the University and the \nmember of  the University community requiring accommodation.

Accommodation is a \nshared responsibility betw een the University and the individual in need of  \naccommodation, and is assessed on the unique circumstances of  each \nindividual. The process requires reasonable accommodation, not instant or \nperfect accommodation. The recipients of  accommodation (e.g. students \nand staf f ) may be required to try dif ferent accommodation options. The \nUniversity is required to provide reasonable accommodation up to the \npoint of  undue hardship.  \nAccommodation of  students neither requires nor implies that the University \nlow er its academic standards. Nor does accommodation relieve the \nstudent of  that student’s responsibility to develop the essential skills and \ncompetencies required by programs. Accommodation neither requires nor \nimplies that the University low er its academic or professional standards. \nNor does accommodation relieve students of  the responsibility to \ndemonstrate the essential skills and competencies required by programs \nor staf f  of  the responsibility to meet the performance requirements of  a \nposition in w hich they are accommodated. \nUndue Hardship The University has a duty to take reasonable steps to accommodate \nindividual needs to the point of  undue hardship. Undue hardship occurs \nw hen accommodation w ould create onerous conditions for the University.  \nWhile undue hardship w ill be decided in the circumstances of  each case, \nonerous conditions, including but not limited to the follow ing, should be \nconsidered:  \na) w hen there is a risk to the safety of  others or a substantive risk of  \npersonal injury to the person seeking accommodation.  \nb) w hen f inancial cost is such that a program or service w ould cease \nto exist due to the f inancial burden of  the accommodation, or other \ncircumstances w here it w ould be unreasonable to expect the \nUniversity to bear the costs of  accommodation.  \nc) When accommodation alternatives w ould result in low ering \nAPC Item 9 - page 26\n U of A Policies and Procedures On-Line (UAPPOL) \nperformance standards or in substantive job requirements being \nunmet.  \nd) When the accommodation w ould be unduly disruptive to an \nacademic staf f  or collective agreement or cause substantial \ndetrimental ef fect on other employees.  \ne) When an educational accommodation w ould result in essential \nelements of  a service or a program not being of fered to other \nstudents, or cause a detrimental ef fect on other students, as a \nresult of  accommodating an individual or a group of  students.  \nAll students are bound by the Code of  Student Behaviour. \nAccommodation of  students neither requires nor implies that the University \nlow er its standards nor does accommodation relieve the student of  their \nresponsibility to develop the essential skills and competencies required by \nprograms.  \nBona fide  requirement (BFR) / \nBona fide  occupational \nrequirement (BFOR) \nA limitation on individual rights may be reasonable and justif iable if  the \nuniversity can show  that a discriminatory practice, standard, decision or \nrule is a “bona f ide requirement” (BFR) or “bona f ide occupational \nrequirement” (BFOR). To justify such a determination, the University must \ndemonstrate, on a balance of  probabilities, that the impugned practice, \nstandard, decision or rule:  \na) w as adopted for a rational purpose connected to the performance of  \nthe job or the provision of  the service;  \nb) w as adopted in an honest and good faith belief  that it w as \nnecessary to the fulf illment of  the job or service;  \nc) is reasonable and necessary to the fulf illment of  the job or service.  \nDuty to Accommodate The duty to accommodate obligates the University to make reasonable \nadjustments, to the point of  undue hardship or as required by law , to the \ndelivery of  services (including teaching and the method of  evaluation) and \nthe conditions of  employment in order to reduce or eliminate the impact of  \ndiscriminatory rules, policies, practices, standards, terms of  employment, \nor decisions, w hich have an adverse impact on an individual or group of  \nindividuals based on a characteristic or perceived characteristic referenced \nin the Protected Grounds.  \nProtected Grounds Discrimination is prohibited based on the follow ing protected grounds:  \na) race  \nb) colour  \nc) ancestry  \nd) place of  origin  \ne) religious beliefs  \nf) gender, gender expression and gender identity (including \npregnancy and gender identity)  \ng) physical disability  \nh) mental disability  \ni) marital status  \nj) family status  \nk) source of  income  \nl) sexual orientation  \nm)  age  \nn) political beliefs;  \nor any other groups as amended f rom time to time.  \nProtected Areas Discrimination is prohibited in the follow ing protected areas: \na) employment  \nb) tenancy  \nc) access to goods and services \nAPC Item 9 - page 27\n U of A Policies and Procedures On-Line (UAPPOL) \nd) access to accommodations or facilities customarily available to \nmembers of  the public \nDiscrimination A distinction, w hether or not intentional, based on a characteristic or \nperceived characteristic referenced in the Protected Grounds that has the \nef fect of  imposing on an individual or group of  individuals burdens, \nobligations or disadvantages that are not imposed on others, or of  \nw ithholding or limiting access to opportunities, benef its and advantages \navailable to other individuals in society.  \nRELATED LINKS \nShould a link fail, please contact uappol@ualberta.ca.

Recognizing At \nRisk Behaviour and responding with interest and concern are critical factors in preventing potential \nviolence (including harm to self, others and University property). The objective of this Policy is to create a \nsystem that will allow for the gathering of reports of At Risk Behaviour from across the University in order \nto facilitate a “connecting of the dots” of what could otherwise be viewed as isolated and less urgent \nincidents. If the connection between those incidents leads to the conclusion that an individual is in need of \nassistance, the existing support systems in place for members of the University community would work \nwith the Individual at Risk in an effort to provide that individual with the assistance required and \ntherefore minimize the possibility of a situation escalating. \nIt is important to recognize that the University also has systems in place for dealing with disciplinary \nmatters (e.g. The Code of Student Behaviour and the various collective agreements), and for dealing with \ncases of imminent danger (e.g. The Protocol for Urgent Cases of Disruptive, Threatening or Violent \nConduct (GFC Policy 91) and the Emergency Management PlanOffice). \nPurpose \nThe purpose of this policy is to facilitate early identification of At Risk Behaviour and create a system \ndesigned to receive and consolidate reports of At Risk Behaviour. Consolidating reports of At Risk \nBehaviour will enable a team to identifyidentification of situations in which seemingly isolated incidents \nare, in fact, connected so that the At Risk Behaviour can be properly assessed and the Individual At Risk \noffered assistance when deemed appropriate. Doing so should result in increased mental wellness and/or \na decreased risk of violence and at the same time reduce the likelihood of matters escalating.  \nThis policy also offers an opportunity for concerned members of the University Community to report At \nRisk Behaviour.  \nAPC Item 10 - page 5\nhttps://policiesonline.ualberta.ca/policiesprocedures/policies/recruitment-policy.pdf\nhttps://policiesonline.ualberta.ca/policiesprocedures/procedures/recruitment-policy-appendix-a-definition-and-categories-of-academic-staff-and-colleagues.pdf\nhttps://policiesonline.ualberta.ca/policiesprocedures/procedures/recruitment-policy-appendix-b-definition-and-categories-of-support-staff.pdf\n  U of A Policies and Procedures On-Line (UAPPOL) \nPOLICY \n1.
