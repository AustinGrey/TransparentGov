            "Description": "Purpose of the Proposal: For discussion and feedback. Member input will be used in the refinement of the new institutional strategic plan. Discussion: The Chair reviewed the how the draft institutional strategic plan had been developed starting with a Senior Administration retreat in summer of 2015, and including the first joint retreat of GFC, the Board of Governors, Senate, and Alumni Council Executive ever held at the University of Alberta. He noted that the key issues identified during these exercises were included within the subsequent Discussion Paper. In addition to this early consultation, he reported that there was extensive consultation including round tables, updates, and forums with over 850 individuals, online feedback and finally, the creation of the Institutional Strategic Plan Advisory Committee. He emphasized that members of this Committee were diligent in attending each meeting or forum, considering all responses and feedback, identifying themes, and working with the writing team to compose the actual draft. The Chair noted that the document has been created around five verbs: Build, Experience, Excel, Engage, Sustain; each of which includes a related goal, objectives and strategies. He also acknowledged the tension between those calling for a short and succinct document and those in favour of a detailed, in-depth review of the academy’s activities. In response, the document was crafted in such a way to allow readers to peruse it for three minutes, review it in 30 minutes, or examine it in three hours. During the discussion members expressed support for the draft including the use of the five verbs and the manner in which it captures current and future areas of focus. In regards to the title of the document, members provided numerous favourable comment, including that “For The Public Good” reflects that the University of Alberta is a public institution and that is it important for the unique mission of the academy. On this point, the Chair noted that the University of Alberta is a major international research institution and that the document must also reflect this. A member suggested “Uplifting the Whole People”, and the Chair acknowledged that the academy would always preserve that particular promise in its actions. A member noted that the tax payer should be considered when considering a title for the document. The Chair thanked members for their comments and invited them to provide any additional thoughts via the website. He reminded members that the final document would be presented for final recommendation by General Faculties Council to the Board of Governors at the May 30, 2016 meeting. In conclusion, the Chair recognized Dr Amy Dambrowitz and Dr Anne Bailey for their work on the development and draft of the institutional strategic plan.",

            "Description": "Purpose of the Proposal: To provide General Faculties Council (GFC) with additional information regarding the role of GFC and delegated authority to GFC Standing Committees and to engage GFC in a discussion on the merits of the current delegations. To ask members to serve on the working group to provide recommendations for GFC’s consideration at the May 30, 2016 meeting. Discussion: Mr Thaker provided members with an update in regards to the Academic Governance Working Group established by the GFC Exective Committee in response to the Motions passed at the January 25, 2016 meeting of GFC to review and vote upon GFC’s delegated authorities to its Standing Committees. He acknowledge the assistance of Ms Marion Haggarty-France (University Secretary) and Ms Meg Brolley (GFC Secretary and Manager of GFC Services) in this endeavour. Dr Elliott highlighted the issues of concern under review including a perceived lack of transparency and the perception that nothing substantive comes before GFC. Following this overview, the delegated authorities and organizational chart of all GFC Standing Committees. Dr Elliott noted the number of hours of committee meetings and of GFC meetings. He pointed out a summary of Motions passed under delegated authority by GFC’s Standing Committees from 2015-2016. Dr Elliott suggested that, while GFC retains authority related to high level strategic and stewardship policy issues, items that a Standing Committee considers to be of major strategic significance or long term impact, and those where there was a strong division of opinion at the Standing Committee level, the full potential of GFC is underutilized, and that more strategic issues should come forward to GFC. He acknowledged that this may require a culture change. He reported that the members of the Working Group did not identify any issues with existing delegations. There was a brief discussion on how many meetings of GFC there should be each year; a member suggested that GFC members may request additional meetings if more substantive business were to come forward. On the issue of transparency, Dr Elliott reported that a high level of transparency already exists, although not many members may be aware of this. He cited, as examples, the availability of all Standing Committee meeting materials online and that all of these are open meetings. In addition, he noted a number of operational changes, some of which are recommended Students’ Union paper, “A Reflection on the State of Academic Governance at the University of Alberta”, had already been implemented. These changes include name cards at GFC, the availability of GFC attendance letters for students, increased communication and interaction between GFC and the Board of Governors and the availability of all past meeting materials on the University Governance website from March 1, 2016 onward. Finally, Dr Elliott invited members of GFC to join the Working Group to provide further viewpoints. He also noted that a link was provided on the University Governance website for comments which would be provided to the working group. During the ensuing discussion, members agreed that a special meeting of GFC would need to be scheduled to address this topic in greater detail, and to allow for more discussion. In addition, a member emphasized that there could be more focus on the SU Report during the discussions as it contained many relevant ideas. A member suggested that more meetings would not solve the issue of GFC’s limited engagement in large, strategic issues. She recognized that, although recent meetings had improved, there could be further work to ensure that meetings contain appropriate proposals. A member thanked the Working Group for their work and added that it seems like GFC’s Standing Committees are doing all of the real work, with the GFC Executive Committee considering urgent items and routine items. He encouraged the Chair to bring more items of importance to GFC and noted that meetings have improved. A couple of members expressed concern about application deadlines and the method of GFC Standing Committee member elections, adding that there was confusion surrounding the role of the GFC Nominating Committee. A member also noted that GFC is not aware of items being considered by its Standing Committees. She questioned how this could be changed. A member requested a review of GFC’s delegations of authority to individuals, as well. The Chair thanked members for their important comments and added that the individual GFC Standing Committees would be reflecting on these issues and would report back to the Working Group. He noted that another meeting would be required to fully discuss these issues and that this opportunity to review the processes of self-governance is valuable. He reminded members that the GFC structure and processes had developed over many years and that GFC members continue to drive change in response to current context. He noted, for instance, that the use of secret ballots for GFC was an unusual practice. He encouraged GFC members to volunteer for the Working Group. Ms Meg Brolley, in the absence of Dr Mirko van der Baan, Chair of the GFC Nominating Committee, provided members with a reminder to check the governance website for current vacancies on standing committees.",

The initial phase of consultation wrapped up and provided extensive and wide-\nranging advice and feedback on our shared goals and objectives. Our aim is to develop a plan \nthat reflects our common values and captures our collective vision of the university community \nand articulates our aspirations. In the years ahead, we will look to this one strategic plan to guide \nall of our institutional academic and administrative priorities and decisions. The first draft of the \nplan has been released and we will engage in consultation with members from across the \ncampus community. After review and revision to incorporate the consultation feedback, we \nanticipate the final draft will make its way through the governance cycle for approval at the  \nJune 17 meeting of the Board of Governors.   \nThe coming year will see significant renewal within our leadership. The Chancellor search is well \nunderway, and we look forward to the announcement of our next Chancellor in May and last \nmonth we welcomed Michael Phair as our new Chair of the Board of Governors.  You will also be \naware that two of our long-standing Vice-Presidents, Don Hickey and Phyllis Clark, will not seek \nrenewal to their terms when they end in the coming year. We have launched the search for their \nsuccessors. We have also undertaken searches for a number of our faculty deans this year. I \ncannot thank our leadership team enough for the guidance and support they have given me this \npast year. I appreciate the passion they bring to their roles, the talent and strength they have \nfostered within the university community, and their commitment to helping in the transition \nprocess.  \nI look forward to working with all of our new team members, along our tremendous community of \nfaculty, staff, student and volunteers.  \nYours sincerely, \nDavid H. Turpin, CM, LLD, FRSC \nPresident and Vice-Chancellor \nGENERAL FACULTIES COUNCIL - Item No. 3\nhttp://www.president.ualberta.ca/\n1 \nREPORT OF THE PRESIDENT TO GENERAL FACULTIES COUNCIL \nMARCH 2016 \nIn addition to sharing good news about the University, this report is focused on three specific themes reflecting \nthe majority of my activity over the last few months: 1) Building Community Engagement, 2) the Institutional \nStrategic Planning Process, and 3) Advancing Specific Priorities. \n1. Building Community Engagement \nMy focus has been on establishing connections within the university and with our supporters locally, \nprovincially and nationally. Below is a summary of some of those activities since the last GFC meeting: \nInternal connections \nBoard Chair – As you know, the provincial government has appointed Michael Phair as Chair of the University \nof Alberta Board of Governors for a three-year term. Since his appointment late last month, Mr. Phair and I \nhave already had a number of meetings. \nExternal connections \nGovernment – The Honourable Marlin Schmidt, recently named Minister of Advanced Education, held a \nconference call with all 26 Alberta post-secondary presidents soon after his appointment. He followed up with a \nmeeting in mid-February with the Universities of Alberta, Calgary and Lethbridge. He is familiar with the \nUniversity of Alberta, having visited campus in the fall, and I look forward to working with him in his new role. \nThe Honourable Navdeep Singh Bains, Minister of Innovation, Science and Economic Development, recently \ntoured the National Institute for Nanotechnology. I always appreciate the opportunity to showcase our world-\nclass research, and facilities, to members of government. \nWe welcomed the Honourable Kirsty Duncan, Minister of Science, and the Honourable Amarjeet Sohi, Minister \nof Infrastructure and Communities, to our North Campus this month for a meeting, lab tour and announced that \nnine University of Alberta recipients - amounting to a total of $2.08 million in funding – were successful in the \nCanada Foundation for Innovation’s John R. Evans Leaders Fund competition. Minister Duncan and I also had \nan opportunity to sit down for a one-on-one discussion. \nComprehensive Academic and Research Institutions (CARI) – The Alberta CARI Presidents meet regularly \nto discuss a variety of issues related to running these universities as a part of Campus Alberta. I met with \nElizabeth Cannon and Mike Mahon recently to further these discussions and together we made a joint budget \nsubmission to the Provincial Government. This submission makes the case for continuing the Bill 3 funding.   \nDonors and Industry Supporters – Engaging with key donors and industry partners is a critical aspect of my \nrole and I am pleased with the results of these meetings. I have travelled recently to Calgary and Ottawa and \ncontinue to have strategic meetings in Edmonton, as well.  \nhttp://www.alberta.ca/release.cfm?xID=40278FC2B09A2-EF2F-78D2-7BB36DAD1E0AA7E7\n2 \n2. Institutional Strategic Planning Process \nA university’s institutional strategic plan is the single most powerful tool for building a shared vision, enabling \nco-ordinated efforts, and maximizing finite resources. Ideally, it should empower each one of us to work \ntowards collective goals. The University of Alberta’s next institutional strategic plan must be the product of our \ncommunity’s efforts to share ideas and aspirations for the next decade. \nFrom November to early March this year, we led more than 30 meetings across all U of A campuses, including \nfive campus forums and five roundtables. More than 850 people have been consulted in person. Many others \ncontributed to the discussion online. With the assistance of the Institutional Strategic Planning Advisory \nCommittee, we have identified consensus themes and ideas and were pleased to present the first draft of the \ninstitutional strategic plan, tentatively entitled “For the Public Good,” to the campus community last week. \nIn drafting this document, our aim has been to capture the energy and enthusiasm we heard throughout the \nconsultations. Ours is a community that is keen to build on our strengths and to act for the benefit of both our \nuniversity and the public good. That energy infuses our document. \nThe plan, as drafted and structured, allows readers to approach it in different ways. With five succinct actions \n(Build, Experience, Excel, Engage, and Sustain) and five broad goals, the plan can quickly unfold, with a \nrunning narrative tying together goals and objectives to show our overall direction for the future. A reader can \nfind both the U of A’s story and our plans for the future, but the document can be digested in just five minutes \nor over the course of an hour or two. \nWe have now entered the second phase of the Institutional Strategic Planning process: consultation and \nfeedback on the draft plan. During this meeting of the GFC we will present the first draft of the plan. This draft \nwas the topic of a campus forum on March 14th and will continue marking its way through the community for \nfeedback and the final draft of the Institutional Strategic Plan will be presented to the Board in June. \n3 \n3. Advancing Specific Priorities \nInfrastructure Funding – A major objective has been to see both Federal and Provincial infrastructure funding \ntargeted to post-secondary institutions. This priority has occupied considerable time in Ottawa and Edmonton. \nMaskwa House of Learning / Wahkohtowin Lodge -   Maskwa House will serve as a gathering place for \nIndigenous people on the university’s North Campus, but it is only part of the university’s overall commitment to \nReconciliation. I am pleased to report that Wahkohtowin Lodge will be opening its doors at our Augustana \nCampus later in March. These gathering places are foundational to the ongoing efforts to support and \ncelebrate our Indigenous students and faculty, and build understanding between Indigenous and non-\nIndigenous peoples.  \nScholarship for Syrian Students - As the unrest and uncertainty continues in Syria and other parts of the \nworld, I am proud that the University of Alberta has been able to make a difference in the lives of several \nstudents and researchers. The President’s Award for Refugees and Displaced Persons, which covers tuition \nand living expenses for up to 10 Syrian students per year, has been awarded to two deserving students. Both \nNaseen Alrayes and Badi Jabbour studied medicine in Syria before being forced to flee their homes and \nschools for fear of the missiles and bombs devastating their communities. I am pleased to report that these two \nstudents commenced their studies at the University of Alberta in January. \nThe Scholar Rescue Fund is an initiative from the U.S.-based Institute for International Education that provides \nfellowships and visiting appointments for threatened scholars to continue their work in safety at participating \nacademic institutions. This year the University of Alberta has accepted two visiting scholars from Syria through \nthis program. \nUAlberta North - UAlberta North is a new entity within the University of Alberta that will act as a focal point for \nresearch, partnerships and advocacy for initiatives involving the North. Its mandate is based on the University’s \nNorthern Strategy and takes on some responsibilities from the retiring Canadian Circumpolar Institute and \nadditional roles to unify northern efforts throughout the university. Roger Epp is the Director of UAlberta North \nand is charged with identifying the best ways to collaborate with existing projects, and develop new \npartnerships and engagement with the North. By leveraging strategic partnerships we can further our \nunderstanding of issues affecting our northern environments and neighbours, how those issues affect a greater \nenvironment and community, and explore emerging issues and areas of interest.  \n4 \n4. Good News \nEvery day our faculty, operational staff and students have news-worthy accomplishments, each with a history, \na future and a team of individuals that helped make it happen. Here are a few recent stories:  \nInstitute of Circulatory and Respiratory Health (ICRH) - Brian Rowe has been appointed as scientific \ndirector of the Canadian Institutes of Health Research’s (CIHR) ICRH. The ICRH supports research into a wide \nrange of conditions associated with the heart, lung, brain, blood and blood vessels, critical care and sleep. The \nfour-year appointment, effective January 1, gives Dr. Rowe the opportunity to help shape the future of \nCanadian research in circulatory and respiratory health. With the new appointment, Rowe says he will now \nspend about half of his academic time on CIHR activities, while still continuing his work as a professor and \nresearcher at the University of Alberta and an emergency physician with Alberta Health Services.  \nCanada Research Chairs (CRC) – This program was created in 2000 to help attract and retain some of the \nworld’s most accomplished and promising minds. There are two tiers to the program: tier one awards $200,000 \nannually over seven years, and tier two awards $100,000 annually over five years. The Federal Government \nrecently announced two new CRCs for the University of Alberta, along with one advancement in tier, and \nseven renewals worth a total of $10.4 million. The U of A now boasts 49 tier 1 chairs and 35 tier 2 chairs worth \n$13.3 million annually.  \nAssociation of Faculties of Medicine of Canada - Jack Jhamandas, currently a Distinguished University \nProfessor in the Division of Neurology in the Faculty of Medicine & Dentistry at the University of Alberta, has \nbeen appointed as Vice-President, Research, for the Association of Faculties of Medicine of Canada. His \nresponsibilities include liaising with key stakeholders and providing leadership to AFMC on the promotion of \nhealth research in Canada. \nAwards \nGeoff Gowan Lifetime Achievement Award - This award was created by the Coaching Association of \nCanada in 1996 to recognize individuals who have made lifetime contributions to coaching development. \nProfessor Emeritus John Hogg was awarded the 2015 Geoff Gowan Lifetime Achievement Award for his \ninnovative body of work in swimming, and joins an elite group of previous winners that includes Clare Drake, \nbasketball coach Jack Donahue and Olympic rowing coach Al Morrow. \nAmerican National Academy of Inventors (NAI) – University of Alberta Vice President (Research) Lorne \nBabiuk has been named a Fellow of the NAI, one of the highest professional distinctions accorded to academic \n5 \ninventors who have demonstrated a highly prolific spirit of innovation in creating or facilitating outstanding \ninventions that have made a tangible impact on quality of life, economic development, and welfare of society. \nItem No. 4 \nGENERAL FACULTIES COUNCIL \nFor the Meeting of March 21, 2016 \nOUTLINE OF ISSUE \nAgenda Title: First Draft: Institutional Strategic Plan  \nMotion:  N/A \nItem   \nAction Requested Approval Recommendation  Discussion/Advice Information \nProposed by David H.

The University \nof Alberta gives a national and international voice to innovation in our province, taking a lead role \nin placing Canada at the global forefront.\nValues\nThe University of Alberta community of students, faculty, staff, and alumni rely on shared, deeply \nheld values that guide behaviour and actions. These values are drawn from the principles on \nwhich the University of Alberta was founded in 1908 and reflect a dynamic, modern institution of \nhigher learning, leading change nationally and internationally.\nAbove all, we value intellectual integrity, freedom of inquiry and expression, and the equality \nand dignity of all persons as the foundation of ethical conduct in research, teaching, learning, \nand service.\nWe value excellence in teaching, research, and creative activity that enriches learning \nexperiences, advances knowledge, inspires engaged citizenship, and promotes the public good.\nWe value learners at all stages of life and strive to provide an intellectually rewarding educational \nenvironment for all.\nWe value academic freedom and institutional autonomy as fundamental to open inquiry and the \npursuit of truth.\nWe value diversity, inclusivity, and equity across and among our people, campuses, and \ndisciplines.\nWe value creativity and innovation from the genesis of ideas through to the dissemination of \nknowledge.\nWe value history and tradition, celebrating the contributions of students, alumni, faculty, staff, \nvolunteers, Indigenous peoples, and other groups, which bring pride to the university.\n4\nU N I V E R S I T Y  O F  A L B E R T A\nAt the University of Alberta, we begin with people—people with ideas, \ntalent, and purpose. Then, we act.\nWe seek knowledge. We educate citizens. We ask the big questions. We push the limits of \nhuman understanding and knowledge. We engage with partners and communities close to home \nand around the world to lead positive change. We empower creative people to take risks and \nexperiment.\nWhy? The answer is simple: We are a public university acting for the public good.\nWhen we act, we provide meaningful educational experiences, promote innovative thinking, \nand develop compelling and relevant solutions that matter. When we lead, we tackle the most \nimportant local, national, and global challenges. When we excel, our work sparks and feeds \nwidespread social, cultural, and economic benefits for others—indeed for the uplifting of the \nwhole people.\nIn For the Public Good—our institutional strategic plan for the coming decade—we embrace and \naffirm our vision to inspire the human spirit through outstanding achievements in learning, \ndiscovery, and citizenship in a creative community, building one of the world’s great universities \nfor the public good.\nWe forge ahead, motivated and supported by the University of Alberta’s 108-year history of \nleadership, achievement, and public service. Inspired by the goals and aspirations in this plan, \nwe will:\nBUILD a diverse, inclusive community of exceptional students, faculty, and \nstaff from Alberta, Canada, and the world.\nEXPERIENCE diverse and rewarding learning opportunities that inspire \nus, nurture our talents, expand our knowledge and skills, and enable our \nsuccess. \nEXCEL as individuals, and together, sustain a culture that fosters and \nchampions distinction and distinctiveness in teaching, learning, research, \nand service.\nENGAGE communities across campuses, the province, Canada, and the \nworld to create reciprocal, mutually beneficial learning experiences, \nresearch projects, partnerships, and collaborations.\nSUSTAIN our people, our work, and the environment by attracting and \nstewarding the resources we need to deliver excellence to the benefit of all.\nIn pursuit of these shared goals, the University of Alberta will deepen our dedication to excellence \nand extend our record of public leadership, playing a lead role in building a better province, a \nbetter Canada, and a better world.\nD\nR\nAFT\n5\nI N S T I T U T I O N A L  S T R A T E G I C  P L A N  -  M A R C H  2 0 1 6 \nThe University of Alberta is Alberta’s educator, generator of new ideas, and engine of social, \ncultural, and economic prosperity. Created by one of the first acts of the legislature, our \nuniversity is one of the province’s most enduring and vital public institutions. As our name \nsuggests, our history is bound to that of Alberta; we acknowledge with pride that we stand on \nTreaty 6 Territory, the traditional gathering place of First Nations, Métis, and Inuit peoples.  \nFor more than a century, University of Alberta scholars have inspired graduates to become \npurposeful, active citizens and leaders. Our alumni—now numbering more than 275,000—\nhave founded more than 70,000 organizations and businesses around the world, creating \none and a half million jobs, nearly 400,000 in Alberta. Along with inspiring next-generation \nleaders, University of Alberta scholars have engaged in research and creative activities \nanswering fundamental questions, building new industries and businesses, healing the \nsick, fostering social and economic change, and leading an innovative and vibrant arts and \nculture scene. They are world leaders in fields as diverse as virology, literature and history, \nagricultural genomics and proteomics, paleontology, and energy. Today, the University of \nAlberta is one of Canada’s leading research universities. Standing with pride among the \nworld’s finest public institutions, the University of Alberta brings the ideas of Albertans to \nthe world, and the world of ideas to Albertans.\n6\nU N I V E R S I T Y  O F  A L B E R T A\nBUILD\nGOAL: Build a diverse, inclusive community of \nexceptional students, faculty, and staff from Alberta, \nCanada, and the world. \nThrough the development of strategic recruitment, retention, and renewal plans, the University \nof Alberta will build a community of exceptional students, scholars, researchers, and staff \nfrom Alberta, Canada, and the world. We will foster an inclusive culture in which people excel \nthrough exchange and collaboration, enriched by the diversity of individuals, groups, disciplines, \nperspectives, approaches, and questions that compose our community. We will sustain this \nculture and community through rich educational and life experiences in a supportive learning \nenvironment. We will engage Indigenous students and nations to create programs and spaces \nthat acknowledge the complexities of Canada’s history.

GFC considered numerous documents including two \nadministrative papers: Moving Forward – White Paper on General Faculties Council Reforms, and \nReport of Task Force on GFC Reforms; one document from the Students’ Union: Discussion Paper on \nGeneral Faculties Council; plus GFC Executive Committee Guidelines for Discussion Topics for \nMeeting of GFC; and associated minutes for these discussions at both GFC and the GFC Executive \nCommittee. These documents span a time frame of June 2013 to February 2015. \nIn addition to the discussion, two motions proposed by members were approved by GFC:  \nMotion I:  THAT General Faculties Council will review the delegation of its authorities to all of its \ncurrent committee, and by 30 June 2016 vote on whether to renew or revise these delegated \nauthorities. \nMotion II: THAT the review of the governance and operations of the General Faculties Council is \nto be informed by the June 2013 report “A Reflection on the State of Academic Governance at \nthe University of Alberta” \nThe GFC Executive Committee was tasked with developing concrete plans to prioritize and address the \nissues raised and the approved motions and report back to GFC within the proposed timelines. \nAt the February 1, 2016 meeting, the GFC Executive Committee discussed the feedback and direction \nfrom GFC. A few members of the GFC Executive Committee formed a working group to work further on \nthis matter. The working group met twice between the February 1 and March 7 GFC Executive \nCommittee meetings. The GFC members who submitted the above motions were invited to attend a \nworking group meeting to present their viewpoints; only one member was able to attend. \nAfter a further discussion at the March 7 GFC Executive Committee meeting, the following plan of \naction was developed for the consideration of GFC.  The GFC Executive Committee would present to \nGFC an overview of issues identified through the January 25 discussion and the distributed documents, \nand additionally provide an overview on the delegations to GFC standing committees. The Committee \nwould also update GFC on operational changes made, or in the process of being made, to address \nconcerns expressed in relation to transparency and communication.  \nRecently

It is difficult to accurately represent in an organizational chart the manner in which business flows through the University of Alberta’s academic governance system. For that reason, those \ninterested in learning more are referred to the appropriate source documents, including the Post-Secondary Learning Act, GFC’s Terms of Reference, the General Terms of Reference for GFC\nStanding Committees, and the individual GFC Standing Committee Terms of Reference for details on roles/responsibilities and delegations of authority.\n2. The GFC Executive Committee has been distinguished in this chart given its central role in setting the Agendas for all GFC meetings.  That said, not all academic business flows up to and is\nconsidered by GFC; in some instances, certain GFC Standing Committees have delegated authority to make final decisions or to recommend directly to the Board of Governors..\n3. The GFC Replenishment Committee’s sole function is to replenish the GFC Executive Committee (which functions, too, as GFC’s Nominating Committee).  As such, nominee slates go directly \nfrom GFC RC to GFC.\nItem 5 - Attachment 3\nPage 1 of 8 \nGFC STANDING COMMITTEE DESCRIPTIONS  \nThe Post-Secondary Learning Act (PSLA) gives General Faculties Council (GFC) responsibility, subject to the \nauthority of the Board of Governors, over \"academic affairs\" (section 26(1)). To carry out its responsibilities, \nGFC has established standing committees and appeal boards and has enacted policies governing the \nreplenishment and operation of those groups.  Full terms of reference for the following committees can be found \non line on the University Governance website (www.ualberta.ca/governance ).   \nGFC has nine (9) standing committees and three (3) appeal boards supported by University Governance. \nStanding Committees \n• GFC Academic Planning Committee (APC \n• GFC Academic Standards Committee (ASC)  \n• GFC Committee On The Learning Environment (CLE)  \n• GFC Campus Law Review Committee (CLRC)  \n• GFC Executive Committee (GFC EXEC) And GFC Nominating Committee (GFC NC) \n• GFC Facilities Development Committee (FDC)  \n• GFC Replenishment Committee \n• GFC Undergraduate Awards And Scholarship Committee (UASC)  \n• GFC University Teaching Awards Committee (UTAC)  \nAppeal Boards \n• GFC Academic Appeals Committee (AAC)  \n• University Appeal Board (UAB) \n• GFC Practice Review Board (PRB) \nGFC ACADEMIC PLANNING COMMITTEE (APC) \n• The GFC Academic Planning Committee (APC) is the senior standing committee of General Faculties \nCouncil (GFC).  It deals with a wide range of institutional academic, financial, and planning and priorities \nissues.  It may also consider or recommend to GFC on academic issues related to: restructuring, research, \nand academic service units. It is responsible for promoting excellence in undergraduate teaching and in \ngraduate studies and research.  GFC APC recommends to GFC and/or the Board of Governors on: the \nUniversity's longer term academic and financial development; establishment, termination, or restructuring of \nacademic units; enrolment planning; budget matters; facilities-related policy; institutional-wide admission, \ntransfer, and academic standing/graduation proposals; and termination of academic programs.   \n• It acts under delegated authority from GFC in approving proposals concerning: establishment of new \nundergraduate and graduate academic degree and diploma programs and specializations; establishment, \nrevision to, and termination of academic centres and institutes; creation, revision, or deletion of graduate \ndegree specializations; substantive revisions to existing undergraduate and graduate academic programs; \nand name changes of Departments and Divisions (on Faculty names, it recommends to GFC).  Finally, GFC \nAPC may recommend to the Board of Governors and/or GFC on any other matter deemed by the Committee \nto be within the purview of its general responsibility and to decide on any routine academic matters not \nalready covered by GFC's delegations to the Provost and Vice-President (Academic) or its other standing \ncommittees.  \nChair: Provost and Vice-President (Academic) \nMembership:  Broadly-constituted committee that includes all major institutional stakeholders, with: the Vice-\nPresident (Research), Vice-President (Finance and Administration), the Presidents of the two student \nassociations, one Dean, one Chair, along with GFC-elected faculty and student representatives.

J. Hampson: \nA question was posed at the November 23rd General Faculties Council regarding whether or \nnot administration would consider mandating the inclusion of emergency protocols in course \nsyllabi. Although protocols exist, many students remain unaware of proper procedures to be \nfollowed in the event of emergencies on campus, such as an active shooter. Is there an update \nthat can be provided with respect to the inclusion of evacuation and lockdown procedures in \ncourse syllabi? Is there anything that student leaders can do to assist in addressing this \nawareness gap? \n[Response from the Vice-President (Finance and Administration) will be forwarded to GFC when \nprovided and will appear as Item 7.1 R] \nRelevant Policy:  \nGFC Policy on Question Period: GFC Terms of Reference Section 4 (Procedures)  \nGFC policy provides that Question Period is one half-hour in length and comprises both oral and \nwritten questions. Question Period can be extended if there is a motion to do so. Written \nquestions requiring a written answer should be submitted at least six working days in advance \nof a GFC meeting to give Administration sufficient opportunity to respond.  \nQUESTION TO ADMINISTRATION: \nA question was posed at the November 23rd General Faculties Council regarding whether or not \nadministration would consider mandating the inclusion of emergency protocols in course syllabi. \nAlthough protocols exist, many students remain unaware of proper procedures to be followed in the \nevent of emergencies on campus, such as an active shooter. Is there an update that can be provided \nwith respect to the inclusion of evacuation and lockdown procedures in course syllabi? Is there \nanything that student leaders can do to assist in addressing this awareness gap? \nRESPONSE: \nThe top priority of the University is the safety and security of its staff, students and visitors. To that end \nthe University employees a range of communication strategies and tools to inform the university \ncommunity of its health and safety practices and procedures including what actions should be taken in \nthe event a major incident on campus.   \nOne of the most challenging issues the university faces is communicating with over 50,000 individuals \nas quickly as possible in the event of an incident. In response to this challenge the University has \ndeveloped UofA Alerts – a comprehensive range of emergency communication tools including: \n• the University’s webpage \n• Twitter \n• Facebook \n• Alertus – beacons and electronic message boards (in select buildings) and desk-top notifications \n• the University’s  mobile app with emergency “push” notification \n• email \nThe primary location for the most up-to-date and accurate information in the case of an emergency \nwill always be the University’s main website. The University’s webpage is also the primary site for \nregular access to health and safety information, policies, practices, e-learning modules and the health \nand safety related support units that can assist you. \nWe are very supportive of adding a statement to course outlines (syllabi) that will direct students to a \nsingle website that will provide them with all the necessary health and safety information they require \nat the university, including how to respond to a major emergency. We also look forward to working \nwith the student associations to assist in reaching out to all students regarding the importance of this \ninformation and where to access it. Over the next several months the Provost and Vice-President \n(Academic) and the Vice-President (Finance & Administration) will work with the Registrar’s Office and \nappropriate GFC committees to propose that an appropriate message be incorporated into each \ncourse outline, as set out in the Course Requirement, Evaluation Procedures and Grading section of the \nUniversity Calendar. \nSteven Dew, Provost & Vice President (Academic) \nPhyllis Clark, Vice President (Finance & Administration) \nItem No. 8 \nGENERAL FACULTIES COUNCIL \nFor the Meeting of March 21, 2016 \nGeneral Faculty Council Standing Committee Report \nExecutive Committee  \n1.

The \nNominating Committee is charged with ensuring the best possible match between prospective members and \nthe committees to which they are nominated. The annual replenishment of staff and student committee \nmemberships takes place each spring; however, on an ad-hoc basis, the GFC NC may be called upon to fill \ncommittee vacancies as they occur. \nPresidential/Vice-Presidential/Decanal Search and Review Committees are regularly established at the \nUniversity of Alberta. General Faculties Council (GFC) is routinely called upon to arrange for the election of \nrepresentative(s) to populate search/review committee compositions in accordance to the policies and \nprocedure within the Recruitment Policy (in UAPPOL). Campus interest and response to a nomination call may \ngenerate a pool of multiple nominees, thus requiring an election (held by GFC) to declare the successful \ncandidate(s) to a membership role on the selection/review committee. It's regular practice by the GFC \nNominating Committee, through the delegation of authority by GFC, to electronically distribute nomination calls \nto the relevant constituencies (academic staff, non-academic staff, public members) in order to raise awareness \nand encourage nominations and/or expressions of interest from eligible nominees, as stipulated within the \nestablished committee membership composition. \nRECENT MEMBERSHIP APPOINTMENTS/RE-APPOINTMENTS \nAdvisory Search Committees for: \nThe Vice-President (Finance and Administration) and The Vice-President (Facilities and Operations) \nIn accordance to the `Search Procedure for Vice Presidents’ – Appendix “A” (in UAPPOL),  \nThe following individuals have been declared elected by acclamation to serve as the two (2) Faculty \nmembers from Categories (A1.1, A1.6 or their counterparts in A1.5 and A1.7): \n• Dr. Charles Putman (Faculty of Physical Education and Recreation\n• Dr. Vikas Mehrotra (Alberta School of Business)\nThe following individual has been declared as elected to serve as the one (1) Academic Staff member (from \nStaff Categories: A1.2, A1.3, A1.4 and their counterparts in A1.5): \n• Ms. Susan Babcock (Research Ethics Office)\n [END] \nItem No. 11\nhttp://www.governance.ualberta.ca/�\nPage 1 of 1 \nGFC NOMINATING COMMITTEE \n9-March-2016 \n[CIRCULATION BY EMAIL] \nThe GFC Nominating Committee (NC) presents the following nominations for consideration by General Faculties \nCouncil. Upon receipt of this GFC NC Report, members of GFC may submit additional nominations to Ms Ann \nHodgson, Coordinator to the GFC NC, University Governance, extension 2-1938 (ann.hodgson@ualberta.ca). \nAdditional nominations must be received by Ms Hodgson by 12:00 PM on March 15, 2016. The nominees must be \nboth eligible and willing to serve. A brief (approx.150 words) biographical sketch must accompany nominations. If \nno additional nominations are received by the deadline, the nominees noted below will be declared elected. \n“The Nominating Committee is charged with ensuring the best possible match between prospective members and \nthe committees to which they are nominated. It is also the Nominating Committee’s responsibility to ensure the \nbroadest possible base of representation given the available pool of nominees.” [GFC Nominating Committee \nTerms of Reference] The GFC NC is committed to a process that is rigorous in seeking talented individuals for \ncommittee service and devotes substantial time to consultation.   \nFor the terms of reference and full membership composition of GFC Standing Committees, Appeal Boards and \nother committees to which GFC elects, please refer to the University Governance main website and navigate to the \nappropriate committee webpage.

Activities \ninclude presentations to classes, departments, and other \ngroups as requested, and maintaining the website, found at \nwww.osja.ualberta.ca.  \nThroughout the 2014/15 academic year, Deborah Eerkes was \nthe Director of the Office of Student Judicial Affairs. In this \nposition she administers the office, oversees the preventative \nThe attached charts reflect the number of cases completed \nby the Discipline Officer between July 1, 2014 and June 30, \n2015.  In order to align the numbers with those collected \nby University Governance, the cases counted in this report \ninclude those in which the appeal deadline falls between July \n1, 2014, and June 30, 2015. Note that the statistics reported in \nthis document reflect only the cases referred to the OSJA and \ndo not provide total numbers for Code of Student Behaviour \nviolations.\nOver the year, the two Discipline Officers rendered a total \nof 44 discipline decisions. The complexity and seriousness of \nthe offences is reflected in the sanctions imposed, including \nWhen students do engage in behaviour that violates the Code \nof Student Behaviour, one of the two Discipline Officers in \nthe OSJA investigates the allegations and makes decisions \naccording to the procedures set out in the Code. Faculty \nAssociate Deans (mostly academic offences) and University of \nAlberta Protective Services or Unit Directors (non-academic \noffences) refer files with recommendations for sanctions. The \nDiscipline Officer meets with the accused student, investigates \nthe complaint if the facts are in dispute, then makes a decision \non whether the student violated the Code and, if so, what \nsanctions are warranted, using the recommendation from the \nComplainant as a starting point.\nprograms and is one of the two Discipline Officers. Chris \nHackett was Discipline Officer and Academic Integrity \nprogram coordinator. \nORGANIZATION\nDISCIPLINE CASES\n5 expulsions, 7 exclusions, 18 suspensions, 27 orders of \nconduct probation, 2 fines, and 2 orders of restitution. Charges \nwere dismissed in 4 cases. See Fig. 2 below for a three year \ncomparison. \nOf the 44 cases, 7 were appealed to the University Appeal \nBoard; two were upheld, four were denied and one was still \npending at the writing of this report. In addition, the OSJA \nheard one appeal of a violation notice, as compared to 2 the \nprevious year.\n2\nFig. 2 Disposition of Decisions of the Discipline Officer\nNote: Some cases result in multiple sanctions, therefore the total \nnumber of sanctions (65) is greater than the number of cases (44).  \nSANCTION \n(In addition to sanctions already imposed by Deans and/or Unit \nDirectors)\nNUMBER IMPOSED\n2014/15 2013/14 2012/13\nExpulsion 5 1 2\nSuspension 18 6 16\nConduct Probation 27 24 34\nFine 2 1 3\nExclusion 7 3 6\nSuspension University Resources 0 1 0\nRestitution 2 2 2\nReprimand 0 3 3\nCharges upheld; no additional sanction 0 0 1\nCharges dismissed; no sanction 4 6 2\nTotal Sanctions 65 47 66\nDISCIPLINE OFFICER NUMBER OF CASES COMPLETED\n2014/15 2013/14 2012/13\nD.

While this is a slight increase over 2013/14, \nthe office finished the year with 13 open investigations as \nwell as the 44 completed files, showing an overall increase in \ncases. They are complex, often involving legal or procedural \nconsiderations. Investigations take on average 25 hours to \ncomplete, although the time required ranged from 6 hours for \nthe simplest investigation to 97 hours for the most complex. \nMost cases fell within the 15-30 hour range. \nThe majority of academic discipline cases are handled at \nthe Faculty level and OSJA does not become involved. \nAppropriately, only the most egregious cases are referred \nto the OSJA with recommendations for severe sanctions. \nThese cases tended to be more complex in nature and often \ninvolved second offences. Because the statistics cited herein \napply strictly to the Office of Student Judicial Affairs, any \ntrends identified in terms of academic misconduct must not \nbe generalized to the entire University. For a total number \nof academic offences that did not involve a referral to the \nOffice of Student Judicial Affairs, please refer to the Appeals \nCoordinator’s report from University Governance.\nFaculties submitted 19 of our 44 files, and roughly 57% came \nfrom University of Alberta Protective Services (non-academic \nmisconduct). See Fig. 3 below for a three year comparison.\nOf the 19 cases referred to the OSJA by Faculties for academic \nmisconduct, 9 had prior offences and 5 had no record of \nprior offences but were found to have committed multiple \noffences simultaneously. The remaining 5 cases were deemed \nsufficiently serious to warrant a severe sanction for a first \noffence.\nCOMPLAINANT\nNUMBER OF CASES COMPLETED \n2014/15 2013/14 2012/13\nAgricultural, Life and Environmental Sciences 2 0 1\nArts 6 3 1\nBusiness 2 1 1\nEducation 0 0 1\nEngineering 1 1 0\nExtension 2 0 0\nFGSR 3 2 2\nPharmacy 0 0 1\nPhysical Education and Recreation 0 0 1\nScience 3 2 8\nResidence Services 0 0 1\nUniversity of Alberta Protective Services (UAPS) 25 31 33\nTOTAL 44 42 51\nFig. 3  Origin of Cases  \n4\nAs is often the case, gender seems to play a role in non-\nacademic offences: 20 out of 25 students who committed \nnon-academic offences were male, 5 were female. This year \nwas unusual in the sense that there was also a marked gender \ndifference in the academic misconduct cases, in which more \nthan twice as many male as female students were found to \nhave committed offences.

The offences for which they were \nbeing charged were nearly evenly split between academic \noffences (11) and non-academic offences (12). \nOf the 44 cases in the Office of Student Judicial Affairs, \nstudents in their first and fourth years, as well as graduate \nstudents, were most likely to violate the Code of Student \nBehaviour. Nine (9) first-year students, 7 second-year students, \n3 third-year students, and 9 fourth-year students committed \nviolations. In addition, 9 graduate students – 6 in Doctoral \nprograms and 3 working toward Masters’ degrees – were \nreferred to the OSJA last year. Seven (7) other Students \nwho were in the “N/A” category (Open Studies, After Degree \nprograms or the Faculty of Extension), were required to meet \nwith a Discipline Officer.

It can be found at:\nosja.ualberta.ca/en/Instructors/Resources.aspx \nAcademic Integrity Symposium  \n(17–18 October 2014)  \nThe OSJA partnered with MacEwan University to host an \nAlberta Academic Integrity Symposium. The keynote speaker \nwas James M. Lang, author of Cheating Lessons: Learning from \nacademic dishonesty. The symposium was attended by approxi-\nmately 100 people from around the province, and session includ-\ned a wide variety of topics, such as: international students and \nacademic integrity, the use of text matching software to detect \nplagiarism, and teaching for integrity.\nProvincial Academic Integrity Strategy  \nFollowing the symposium, and working with the Senior Student \nServices Officer (SSSO) group of Alberta, the OSJA and our \nMacEwan partners led a province-wide workshop on 17 \nApril 2015 to develop a made-in-Alberta strategy to address \nacademic integrity. With a focus on teaching and learning, \nthe workshop resulted in a series of four academic integrity \n“statements” to be used at any Alberta institution, whether \nresearch intensive, technical or practice-based programs, to \nhelp teach academic integrity.\nAcademic Integrity promotional videos \nIn early 2014, the OSJA, released three videos promoting \nacademic integrity to provide a starting point for professors to \ndiscuss cheating and plagiarism and to help engage students \nin the discussion. By the end of the 2014/15 year, the videos \ncollectively garnered 29,900 views. They are available on the \nOSJA website at osja.ualberta.ca/Students.aspx \nAcademic Integrity Council \nOne of the recommendations from the 2011 Academic \nIntegrity Task Force was to form an Academic Integrity \nCouncil, made up of students, faculty and staff who have \nresponsibilities or interest in academic integrity. The Council \nacts as an advisory body to the OSJA in order to coordinate \nefforts across campus and make improvements to the \nAcademic Integrity program. The Council is chaired by C. \nHackett and met twice in the 2014/15 academic year. Topics \ndiscussed included: engaging students in academic integrity \nbefore they get in trouble, assignment and test design to \ndiscourage academic misconduct, the Alberta Provincial \nAcademic Integrity Strategy, and the Students’ Union’s report \non international students and academic integrity.\nPresentations \nThe OSJA provided a total of 49 presentations on academic \nintegrity, restorative justice, the Code of Student Behaviour, \nstudent/staff interaction and student ethics this year, a \nslight decrease from last year’s total of 53 presentations. \nPresentations on campus included the International Centre, \nFGSR, Lister Residence, Centre for Teaching and Learning, \nSexual Assault Centre, Healthy Campus Unit, Secondary \nEducation, Faculty of Science, Residence Life, Engineering, \nthe Global Administrators Leadership Delegation (GALD), and \n100-level English classes. \nAcademic Discipline Meeting \nThe OSJA organized and participated in a meeting for the key \nstakeholders in academic discipline, including Associate Deans, \nthe Dean of Students, the Student OmbudService and the \nAppeals Coordinator. The meeting provides a forum for open \ncommunication between those involved in academic discipline \nand to address procedural issues that arise in our work. Topics \ncovered this year included: the juxtaposition of academic \nand non-academic misconduct, creating a reporting culture, \nensuring consistency across faculties, and paper mills / online \nhomework services.\n9\nCampus Law Review Committee (CLRC) \nThe Discipline Officer holds an Ex Officio position on CLRC, \nworking closely with other CLRC members to propose policy \nupdates and changes.\nUniversity of Alberta Review of Prevention \nand Response to Sexual Assault  \nThe OSJA embarked on a campus-wide review of the current \nstate of prevention of and response to disclosures of sexual \nassault. Twenty two campus unit interviews were conducted, \nworking toward a report for the Interim Vice-Provost and \nDean of Students. \nStudent Advisors’ Conference \nThe OSJA provided an overview of the possibilities for using \nRestorative Justice techniques for community building and \ndevelopment on 11 March 2015.\nInternational Center for Academic Integrity \n(ICAI) Conference \nThe OSJA provided a preconference workshop in Vancouver, \nBC on 27 February 2015 entitled, “Serious Message, Comedic \nDelivery.”\nUNIVERSITY COMMUNITY AND BEYOND\nStaff Development \nThe OSJA worked with Residence Services to design \nand deliver training to student and professional staff on \nrestorative justice and investigation techniques. In addition, \nthe OSJA provided the following professional development \nopportunities:\n• Understanding the Code of Student Behaviour for \nSexual Assault Centre volunteers;\n• Response to high-risk drinking to the Health and \nWellness Team (now the Healthy Campus Unit);\n• Code of Student Behaviour for graduate student TAs \n(three sessions provided through the FGSR Teaching \nWeek);\n• Preventing and Addressing Academic Misconduct for \nfaculty three sessions for the Faculty of Education \nand on through the Centre for Teaching and \nLearning); and\n• Decision making under the Code of Student \nBehaviour for the Faculty of Science.\nRestorative Justice Training \nThe OSJA is also engaged as members of the Residence \nRestorative Justice Training Team. The team designs and \ncarries out annual staff training for all Residence Life Staff, as \nwell as monthly training sessions addressing specific areas of \nRestorative Justice or Residence processes as needed.  Given \nthe success of the three day training last year, registration \nwas again opened up across the country and a number of \ncolleagues from seven Western Canadian institutions attended \nthe training. A considerable amount of time was spent this year \nredesigning the curriculum, using a blended learning model \nwith an online component and ample opportunity to practice \nnew skills in person.\nGlobal Academic Leaders Development \n(GALD) program \nThe OSJA provided two sessions and held a discussion \nwith groups of administrators from Chinese universities on \ndisciplinary processes and academic integrity. \nInter University Conversation on Sexual \nAssault Prevention and Response \nC. Hackett presented on the University of Alberta’s response \nto sexual assault in Vancouver, BC on 21 April 2015. \n10\nCoalition for Action on High Risk \nDrinking (CAHRD) \nD. Eerkes Chaired the Coalition for Action on High Risk \nDrinking (CAHRD), which involves representatives from \nthe Dean of Students’ Office, UAPS, University Wellness, \nResidence Life, Office of the Student Ombuds, Risk \nManagement Services, the Students’ Union, and the Addictions \nand Mental Health Research Lab, Responsible Hospitality \nEdmonton, Alberta Health Services and the Alberta Gaming \nand Liquor Commission (AGLC). A self-assessment tool, called \nCheck Yourself, for students to gauge their drinking habits in \nrelation to social norms and personal harms was introduced in \nFall 2009 and continued this past year. In addition, CAHRD has \na seat on the Alberta Safer Bars Council, where we can connect \nwith bar owners, police and health professionals as well as \nmunicipal representatives, and is connected with the Alberta \nAlcohol Strategy.  Cerina Lee, student CAHRD member, and \nMelissa Visconti attended the Coalitions Connect Conference \nhosted by Alberta Health Services on behalf of CAHRD. \nRespectfully submitted,\nDeborah Eerkes, Director\nThe OSJA looks forward to continued collaboration with other \nunits within the University. The more we can forge ties with the \nUniversity community, the stronger our prevention network \nwill become.\n11\nItem No. 15B \nGENERAL FACULTIES COUNCIL \nFor the Meeting of March 21, 2016 \nOUTLINE OF ISSUE \nAgenda Title: Annual Report of the Appeals and Compliance Officer (2014-2015) \nItem   \nAction Requested Approval Recommendation  Discussion/Advice Information \nProposed by Michael Peterson, Appeals and Compliance Officer, University \nGovernance \nPresenter Michael Peterson, Appeals and Compliance Officer, University \nGovernance \nSubject Reporting of Discipline and Appeal Statistics \nDetails \nResponsibility Provost and Vice-President (Academic) \nThe Purpose of the Proposal is \n(please be specific) \nTo provide the annual report of statistics, as required by GFC policy.  \nThe Impact of the Proposal is N/A \nReplaces/Revises (eg, policies, \nresolutions) \nN/A \nTimeline/Implementation Date N/A \nEstimated Cost N/A \nSources of Funding N/A \nNotes N/A \nAlignment/Compliance \nAlignment with Guiding \nDocuments \nDare to Discover – Value 3:  “integrity, fairness, and principles of ethical \nconduct built on the foundation of academic freedom, open inquiry, and \nthe pursuit of truth[.]” \nCompliance with Legislation, \nPolicy and/or Procedure \nRelevant to the Proposal \n(please quote legislation and \ninclude identifying section \nnumbers) \n1.

Some statistics for previous years are also included \nfor comparison. \nThis report sets out information about discipline decisions and the appeal process under the Code of Student \nBehaviour (COSB) and the Code of Applicant Behaviour (COAB), with a focus on the university appeal level of the \nUniversity Appeal Board (UAB). This report also sets out information for the two other university level appeal \nbodies, the General Faculties Council Academic Appeals Committee (GFC AAC) and the General Faculties Council \nPractice Review Board (GFC PRB), again focusing on the university appeal level. \nRole of the Appeals Coordinator \nAs Appeals and Compliance Officer, I carry out the role of the Appeals Coordinator under the COSB, COAB, \nUniversity of Alberta Academic Appeals Policy and University of Alberta Practicum Intervention Policy for the \nUAB, GFC AAC and GFC PRB. In this role I am neutral and do not advocate for either party in an appeal. I \nfacilitate or administer the appeal process steps from the time an appeal is received, through the hearing and decision \nmade by an appeal panel, to distribution of the written decision. I also provide procedural information to the parties \nto an appeal and to the appeal panel throughout the appeal process. \nApart from individual appeals, I also oversee the university level appeal system to ensure that the university \ncontinues to implement a fair process by which to address appeals. This includes helping to educate panel members \nas to the framework within which they work when hearing appeals and attempting to help the university community \nunderstand that framework. This report will hopefully aid in that understanding. \nUniversity Level Appeal Process \nThe university level appeal system is made up of three main appeal bodies – the UAB, the GFC AAC and the GFC \nPRB.  \nDiscipline decisions arise as a result of a student being charged with an offense (academic and/or non-academic) \nunder the COSB or COAB. When the appropriate decision-maker has made a final decision as to offense and \nsanction, any parties to that decision have a final appeal to the UAB. \nPage 2 of 5 \nAttachment 1.0 \nThe UAB generally hears appeals from students charged under the COSB or COAB who disagree with the discipline \ndecisions. UAB decisions are final and binding, within the university, subject to judicial review. Under the COSB \nthe UAB has the broad authority to determine whether an offense was committed and to confirm, vary or quash \nsanctions imposed. \nUnder the Academic Appeal Policy, academic standing issues are heard by the GFC AAC. The GFC AAC hears \nappeals from students wishing to appeal faculty decisions on matters of academic standing, including matters such \nas a requirement to withdraw, denial of graduation or promotion. The GFC AAC hears appeals from students after \nthey have exhausted all other avenues of appeal within a faculty. GFC AAC decisions are final and binding, within \nthe university, subject to judicial review. The authority of the GFC AAC is to uphold (and award any remedy not \ninconsistent with faculty rules) or deny an appeal depending upon whether a miscarriage of justice, as defined by the \nAcademic Appeals Policy, occurred within the faculty process.  \nUnder the Practicum Intervention Policy, appeals concerning practicum interventions are heard by the GFC PRB. \nThe GFC PRB’s decisions are final and binding, within the university, subject to judicial review. \nA fourth body, the Three Person Panel under section 30.5.2(8) of the COSB, deals with appeals of decisions not to \nproceed with complaints. (Subsequent to the time period of this report, the COSB was revised to set up a new system \nfor such decisions, eliminating the Three Person Panel.)  \nPrinciples of the Appeal Process  \nAppeals at the university level deal with complex issues affecting students, faculties and the university as a whole. \nGiven this impact, and the fact that this is the final level of appeal so that the issues will be heard for the last time \nwithin the university, it is very important that the appeal process is fair and perceived to be fair. Coming to decisions \nthrough a fair process is also a means to promote confidence in those decisions by the parties and the appeal panels \nthemselves. Being the final level of appeal, the decisions or process may also be subject to judicial scrutiny. \nThe authority of the appeal bodies (UAB/GFC AAC/GFC PRB) flows from the powers delegated under the Post-\nSecondary Learning Act and the appeal bodies carry out their authority as outlined in the applicable university \nappeal policy, and in keeping with the principles of administrative fairness. The principles of administrative fairness \nare the basis for our appeals policies, help us to interpret those policies and provide the framework within which our \nappeal panels make decisions.    \nWhile the appeals process may at times seem complicated and time-consuming, the formal steps of our process \nrecognize the impact and finality of these decisions and ensure the opportunity for parties to an appeal to make their \nbest cases and be heard. Our appeals process is not a court process, but has been designed to allow for students and \nuniversity decision-makers to be able to be heard by an objective panel coming from the university community. The \nsystem is flexible in that it is able to deal with a wide variety of appeals and circumstances (from students and \nuniversity staff representing themselves or being helped by on-campus advisors, to appeals involving lawyers  \nPage 3 of 5 \nAttachment 1.0 \nrepresenting both parties) through consistently applying basic principles of administrative fairness. At its core, our \nappeals system involves the parties fully disclosing and knowing their cases before an appeal hearing, then \nappearing at a hearing where they are able to present and question arguments and information before an objective \nappeal panel. (The UAB process also allows for the option of a paper-only or documentary review hearing, rather \nthan an in-person hearing, when only the severity of sanction, and not the offense, is being appealed.) The appeal \npanel then considers and weighs all of the submissions of the parties and comes to a decision, which it fully explains \nin writing.      \nCurrent Trends \nAs can be seen in the attached statistics, the significant increase in the number of appeals to the university level \nappeal bodies seen in 2013-2014 has been sustained. The current year-to-date suggests we will again see a similar \nnumber. 2014-2015 saw the continued increase in the number of overall decisions made by Deans, with the majority \nof those decisions concerning the academic offenses of plagiarism and cheating. That increase in turn explains, at \nleast in part, the sustained larger number of appeals. Although not statistically tracked, a significant number of \nappeals are received from international students.   \n2014-2015 also saw an increase in the number, complexity and time spent addressing issues (including dealing with \nparties' legal counsel) of appeals to the UAB of non-academic offenses under the COSB.  \nAppeal panels have continued to address complex issues during the appeal process. This includes procedural \nrequests and issues raised by the parties to appeals both before and during hearings. When such issues are raised, the \nappeal panel chair (and sometimes the full appeal panel) must decide how to address the issue, consider the \narguments and circumstances, and then come to a decision to address the issue. The chair (and sometimes full panel) \ndoes this through consultation with the Appeals Coordinator, obtaining legal advice when necessary. Again, all such \ndecisions are made consistently with the relevant appeals policy and principles of administrative fairness, with the \naim of providing both parties a fair opportunity to be heard. Appeals involving legal counsel representing one or \nboth parties are often of a complex nature and often take more time throughout the process.   \nAs a result, the timeframe for an appeal to be completed varies. Some appeals have more procedural issues to \naddress due to the understanding of the parties, some appeals have more procedural issues to address due to the \nnature of the appeal itself. \nIn previous years I found that some of the procedural issues that the appeal panels had to deal with were due to the \nunderstanding of the process by the parties. Working within my role, and with the help of the Office of General \nCounsel, I have continued to promote an understanding of the appeal process and the principles upon which it is \nbased, through meeting with individual students, student advisory groups and faculty groups.  \nIn my past annual report I noted two examples – documentary evidence and witnesses - in the UAB process where \nprocedural issues can arise, leading to arguments by the parties and extra steps in the appeal process. I believe the  \nPage 4 of 5 \nAttachment 1.0 \npast year saw an increased understanding in the university community of the framework and principles of a fair \nappeal process within which the appeals panels address such issues, including the authority of the appeal panels and \nthe appeal process as outlined in the appeal policies, so that parties have been able to more effectively present their \ncases and provide the appeal panels with the information they need to make reasonable decisions.        \nSpecifically, the appeal procedure outlined in the COSB provides for a disclosure process so that both parties are \nable to prepare within a reasonable time before the appeal hearing. If evidence is submitted with too little time \nbefore a hearing, this can lead to the possibility of postponing the hearing. If new evidence or an unnamed witness is \nattempted to be introduced at a hearing, the COSB contains a section that has as its starting point the fact that the \nUAB can refuse to accept introduction of the evidence, on the basis that it would be an unfair surprise to the other \nside and disadvantage them in being able to present their case. However, the COSB also allows the UAB to allow \nany evidence it deems appropriate. If the UAB decides, after hearing from both parties, that the information is \nneeded, it may decide to remedy any potential unfairness by providing time for the other side to prepare, through an \nadjournment. The UAB is not an investigative body, but tries to make its decisions based upon the evidence \npresented by the parties. When issues such as this are raised, though, the UAB will consider how to address the \nmatter based on the principles of fairly allowing both parties to present their cases and having available all the \nrelevant information it needs to come to a decision.  \nWhen witnesses are involved, the COSB appeal process includes both parties providing a witness list by a time \nspecified before the hearing. If a new witness is named at a hearing, the UAB will address the resulting issue in a \nsimilar manner as it does any proposed new evidence. Difficulties have arisen in some cases where no witnesses \nwere called, yet were needed by the UAB to speak to and be questioned about an issue directly in dispute. If it \ndeems it necessary, after hearing from both parties, the UAB can direct that a party call a witness, after an \nadjournment for both parties to prepare. As with any evidence, the starting point is that it is up to the parties to \ndecide how to best present their cases and who to call as a witness, if anyone. However, circumstances can arise \nwhereby the UAB is asked to or decides it needs to address the issue. Whether a witness’ attendance is needed or not \ndepends on what is at issue and in dispute in the appeal, and what a witness may add. \nAppeal Panel Membership \nAll of the university level appeal panels are made up of volunteers. While the exact makeup of a panel depends on \nthe applicable appeal policy, generally the panels are a combination of undergraduate/graduate students and \nacademic staff selected from the university’s appeal panel membership lists. Members serve on approximately six \nappeal panels within a calendar year, but this number varies depending on the number of appeals received and the \nfaculties involved. Appeal panel members come from the greatest variety of faculties possible. For objectivity, no \nappeal panel member may sit on an appeal involving a party from his or her faculty. Appeal hearings are scheduled \nthroughout the academic year, including summer, mostly in evenings around academic schedules. Student panel \nmembers usually serve for two year terms, while academic staff panel members usually serve for three year terms \n(with the possibility of serving additional terms).  \nPage 5 of 5 \nAttachment 1.0 \nIn addition to their understanding of the university environment from their experience as students (both \nundergraduate and graduate) and academic staff, our panel members are provided ongoing training in understanding \nthe principles of administrative fairness within which their tribunals operate. This helps to ensure that, as discussed \nabove, the appeal process is a fair one, with both parties to an appeal being given the opportunity to fully make their \ncases to an objective decision-maker.    \nThe service of appeal panel members is a significant commitment, including considering and addressing procedural \nissues arising before and during hearings, conducting hearings, deliberating and drafting written reasons for \ndecisions. All of our panel members recognize the need to objectively hear submissions from parties to an appeal, \nanalyze and weigh evidence, then come to a reasonable decision based on that evidence. I try to ensure that appeal \npanels have all the needed resources to perform this role. I thank all of the appeal panel members for serving our \nuniversity community, often addressing difficult issues involving student careers, faculty standards and the integrity \nand values of the university.
