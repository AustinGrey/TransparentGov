Discussion: Mr Whitton provided members with an overview of the Annual Report of the Residence Discipline Statistics for 2015-2016. In addition to providing members with historical context in relation to the adoption of Restorative Justice (RJ), he explained the methodology in tracking discipline statistics. He then presented annual data reflecting violations, sanctions and incidents which saw an increase from the last reporting period. He further noted a decrease in alcohol-related incidents on campus. Finally, he noted that there was a marked increase in tracking students at risk. During the ensuing discussion, Mr Whitton addressed questions surrounding cases of eviction, the use of RJ in sexual assault cases, whether incidents occurring off campus are tracked, clarification surrounding reporting processes, and whether any of the reported sanctions are repeated. It was noted that the graphs within the Report were incomplete; the report will be revised to address this and re- posted. The Chair thanked Mr Whitton for his Report and commended him on the successful culture change following RJ's establishment.",

He explained that the draft Policy was developed utilizing consultation with a broad range of stakeholders. Members expressed various comments and questions, including clarification surrounding the definitions of “consent”, “fleeting”, “sexual harassment”, “pressure”, “indecent images”, “concern”, “complaint”; clarification in relation to how processes must change once this Policy is enacted; the power dynamic between instructors, supervisors and learners; whether the definitions would also appear in the Codes; clarification about how the Policy addresses those members of the community not formally affiliated with the University of Alberta such as volunteers; how this Policy and its procedures will address those who do not formally disclose. Dr Costopoulos noted that the definitions with the draft Policy are being reviewed by General Counsel. In addition, he also noted that work was underway on other recommendations from the Review of the University's Response to Sexual Assault including development of educational and training measures for members of the academy. He concluded by stating that the educational component will be a key element of this Policy's implementation and impact. ",

As in past years, we’ve seen a continued acceptance of \nRestorative Justice as simply “the way we address conduct” as opposed to a unique and novel \nconcept that students struggle with. That being said, this past year highlighted the necessity of \ncontinued training on how to functionally use Restorative Justice in a residence community to \nensure consistent application of RJ principles across our residence halls, including to address \nbehavior previously thought to be the realm of the Residence Agreement.\nWhile in previous years we struggled to generate consistent data due to a changeover in our \nHousing Management system, this year’s data was captured with the same methodology as seen \nin the 2014/2015 Annual Report. Unfortunately, in July of 2016 our Housing Management \nSystem provider announced they would be discontinuing support for the Judicial management \nmodule in which we compile these statistics. While that does not impact this year’s data, it may \ncause challenges for future reports. However, we continue to work with our Housing \nManagement System provider to ensure our ability to report on our discipline statistics goes \nunchanged. \nAs with last year, we tracked our judicial statistics on two criteria: Violations, and Sanctions. \nThis allows us to more accurately reflect restorative principles in our judicial statistics. A key \nfactor of restorative justice is that it does not focus on a ‘rule’ that was broken; instead it focuses \non the harms that come from a person’s actions. Accordingly, violations are based on the \nbehaviour of the student that causes harm. \nSanctions are the results of those violations. In many cases, a single restorative sanction can \naddress the harms of several violations (for example, an apology to an entire community may be \nsufficient to address multiple harms caused).\nIn 2015/2016, we had 1,064 unique incidents. This represents a 25% increase over last year’s \nnumber (851 unique incidents); this increase is largely due to increased use of Restorative Justice \non East Campus to manage a wider range of cleanliness and operational issues. In the past, this \ntype of student behavior was almost exclusively handled through our Operations unit but in \nkeeping with our stated position that Restorative Justice is our preferred method of dealing with \nstudent conduct, training on Restorative Justice was extended to our Assignment Coordinators \nand Unit Coordinators. As such, a significant number of incidents were dealt with via Restorative \nJustice. Using restorative justice for cleanliness issues is a new practice for us and we expect \ncontinued growth in its utilization in the future. \nThese incidents resulted in 1210 violations. Those violations were resolved using 668 sanctions, \nof which 83% were Restorative solutions (Community Resolutions, Apology Letters, \nBehavioural Agreements, or Restorative Agreements). This is a slight reduction from last year’s \nfigure of 87%, but given the greater emphasis on Cleaning and Operations issues being dealt \nwith through Restorative Justice, this drop is quite minor.\nIn 2014/2015, Lister Centre accounted for the majority of our conduct with 66% of our total \nincidents originating in Kelsey, Mackenzie, Henday, or Schäffer Hall. However, with the use of \nRestorative Justice for cleanliness issues in 2015/2016, the divide was right down the middle \nwith exactly 50% of our conduct cases in each portfolio. \nLast year’s report highlighted that we saw only 23% of total incidents directly related to alcohol, \nwhich was a 30% improvement over the year before. This year, that trend of improvement has \ncontinued with only 13% of total incidents directly related to alcohol. This trend of improvement \ncan likely be attributed to a change in the cultural of alcohol use in Lister center over the past \nseveral years, such as limited alcohol-related events and preventing consumption in public \nspaces.\nIn last year’s report we began collecting the frequency with which students of concern were \nmanaged by our staff, and discovered that from October (when we started tracking) through to \nMay of 2015, we had approximately 70 students at risk incidents (56 unique students). We \ntracked this figure again, and from May of 2015 to August of 2016 we found we had a marked \nincrease to 172 students of concern that came to our attention, with 126 unique cases.\nSanctions Issued:\nAlc\noh\nol \nPr\nob\nati\non\nAp\nolo\ngy\n Le\ntte\nr\nBe\nha\nvio\nral\n P\nrob\nati\non\nBe\nha\nvio\nura\nl A\ngre\nem\nen\nt\nCl\nea\nnin\ng C\nha\nrge\nCl\nea\nnin\ng R\nes\ntitu\ntio\nn\nCo\nmm\nun\nity\n R\nes\nolu\ntio\nn\nDa\nma\nge\n C\nha\nrge\nDa\nma\nge\ns R\nes\ntitu\ntio\nn\nEv\nict\nion\nNo\n S\nan\ncti\non\n - N\not \nRe\nsp\non\nsib\nle\nNo\nne\n S\npe\ncif\nied\nVis\nitin\ng R\nes\ntric\ntio\nn-50\n50\n150\n250\n350\n450\n550\n650\n3\n71 66\n104\n15 11\n366\n3 4 13\n116\n612\n12\nSanctions Issued May 2015 to August 2016\nNote: None Specified = No Responsible Student Identified; No Sanction – Not Responsible = \nStudent Identified, but found Not Responsible. \nIncidents by Location:\n0 20 40 60 80 100 120 140 160 180\nTamarack\nSchaffer\nResidence Saint-Jean\nPinecrest\nNo Specific Location\nNewton\nMichener Park\nMain Lister \nMackenzie\nLinden\nKelsey\nI-House\nHUB\nHenday\nGrad Res\nECV\nAlder\n11\n161\n79\n39\n11\n104\n30\n58\n126\n2\n60\n39\n167\n125\n23\n28\n1\nIncident Location 2015/2016\nItem No. 6 \nGFC CAMPUS LAW REVIEW COMMITTEE \nFor the Meeting of September 22, 2016 \n OUTLINE OF ISSUE \nAdvice, Discussion, Information Item  \nAgenda Title: Sexual Violence Policy: Development Update \nItem   \nProposed by André Costopoulos, Vice-Provost and Dean of Students \nWayne Patterson, Executive Director, Human Resource Services and \nActing Associate Vice-President (Human Resources) \nPresenter André Costopoulos, Vice-Provost and Dean of Students \nWayne Patterson, Executive Director, Human Resource Services and \nActing Associate Vice-President (Human Resources) \nDetails \nResponsibility Provost and Vice-President (Academic) \nVice-President (Finance and Administration) \nThe Purpose of the item is \n(please be specific) \nTo provide an update and gather feedback on the first draft of the Sexual \nViolence Policy. \nTimeline/Implementation Date Vetting of Policy in Fall 2016.  \nSupplementary Notes and \ncontext \nThe Government of Alberta has made it clear that they expect every \ninstitution to produce a stand-alone policy on sexual violence.

First draft of Sexual Violence Policy (pages 1 – 7) \nPrepared by: Deborah Eerkes, Director, Student Conduct and Accountability deerkes@ualberta.ca  \nmailto:deerkes@ualberta.ca\nDRAFT 11-AUG-16 \nSexual Violence Policy \nOffice of Accountability: Provost and Vice-President (Academic) \nVice-President (Finance and Administration) \nOffice of Administrative \nResponsibility: \nVice-Provost and Dean of Students \nVice-Provost and Associate Vice-President \n(Human Resources) \nApprover: Board of Governors  \nScope: Compliance with this University policy extends to \nall members of the University Community. \nOverview \nSexual violence is a complex and serious problem in society and on university campuses. \nSexual violence can affect individuals of all genders, gender identities, gender expressions, and \nsexual orientations, as well as those from all racial and economic backgrounds, and their loved \nones. \nThe University recognizes the harm caused by a culture in which common attitudes, norms and practices \ntolerate, normalize, trivialize, excuse or outright condone sexual violence. This culture is perpetuated \nthrough  images, television, music, jokes, advertising, jargon, words and figures of speech that normalize \nsexual coercion and shift blame onto those who have experienced sexual violence. As an institution that \nexists in the context of that culture, the University takes seriously its responsibility to reduce sexual \nviolence by fostering a culture of consent and support through education, training and policy. \nThis policy is guided by the following principles: \n● Safety in the work, study and living environment, providing a community in which sexual \nviolence is not tolerated \n● The inherent dignity of all members of the University of Alberta community \n● Comprehensive and coordinated support for anyone in the University Community who \nhas experienced sexual violence regardless of whether they disclose or make a \ncomplaint  \n● Procedural fairness and support in all formal processes related to sexual violence \n● Fostering a culture of consent and support through education, training and policy \nPurpose \nThe purpose of this policy is to make explicit the University’s commitment to addressing sexual \nviolence through education and awareness, comprehensive support for those having \nexperienced sexual violence, and clear, appropriate and fair processes for addressing \ncomplaints of sexual violence. \nPOLICY \nIt is the policy of the University of Alberta that sexual violence committed by any member of the \nUniversity community is strictly prohibited. Any member of the University Community who \ndiscloses having experienced sexual violence will receive support, whether or not it took place \non University property or in relation to University activities.

The University recognizes the possible effects of trauma on \nthose who have experienced sexual violence and supports the efforts of individuals to seek \nsupport and recover.

All University disciplinary \nprocesses are confidential. The privacy and confidentiality of those involved in a disclosure or \ncomplaint of sexual violence will be protected; however, it is important to note that there may be \nlimits to the University’s ability to do so, when: \n● There is a likely risk of harm to self or others; \n● There is reason to believe that other members of the University community may be at \nrisk of harm; or \n● Reporting or action is required or authorized by law. \nAll parties will be informed of the limits of confidentiality.

A complaint made in good faith is not a \nviolation of this policy even if it is not proven in a complaint process. \nDEFINITIONS \nSexual violence Any physical or psychological violence carried out \nwithout consent through sexual means or by targeting \nsexuality. This includes, but is not limited to sexual \nassault, sexual harassment, stalking, indecent \nexposure, voyeurism, distribution of intimate \nimages, inducing incapacitation for the purpose of \nmaking another person vulnerable to non-consensual \nsexual activity, and other analogous conduct. \nDisclose/Disclosure A disclosure occurs when anyone tells a University \nofficial that they have experienced sexual violence.  \nComplaint A complaint is a disclosure for the purpose of initiating \na formal process.  \nSexual assault Having or attempting to have contact of a sexual nature \nwith another individual without that person’s consent, \nincluding but not limited to kissing, fondling, vaginal, \noral or anal penetration or touching.  \nSexual Harassment \n(see also Discrimination, \nHarassment and Duty to \nAccommodate Policy) \nConduct or comment of a sexual nature, which \ndetrimentally affects the work, study or living \nenvironment or otherwise leads to adverse \nconsequences for the target of the sexual harassment. \nIt can be either one-time or repeated and:  \na) is demeaning, intimidating, threatening, or abusive; \nand  \nb) is not trivial or fleeting in nature; and  \nc) causes offence and should have reasonably been \nexpected to offend; and  \nd) serves no legitimate purpose for the work, study or \nliving environment, and  \ne) undermines authority or respect in the work, study or \nliving environment, or impairs work or learning \nperformance, or limits opportunities for advancement or \nthe pursuit of education or research, or creates an \nintimidating, hostile or offensive work or learning \nenvironment.  \nIt may consist of unwanted sexual attention, sexually \noriented remarks or behaviours, or the creation of a \nnegative psychological and emotional environment \nbased on gender, gender identity or sexual orientation. \nIt may be an isolated act or repetitive conduct, but \ncannot be trifling. A reprisal or threat of reprisal against \nan individual for rejecting a sexual solicitation or \nadvance may also constitute sexual harassment.  \nThe person(s) engaged in harassment need not have \nthe intention to harass; it is the objective assessment of \nthe circumstances that matters. How would a \nreasonable observer perceive the situation. A \ncomplainant need not expressly object to unwelcome \nconduct or comments, although any clear indication \nthat the behaviour is unwanted will satisfy the test. A \ncomplainant's apparent passivity or failure to object \novertly to sexual advances does not necessarily signal \nconsent or welcomed behaviour, especially where a \npower imbalance exists between the individuals. \nStalking Repeated unwanted contact or communication of a \nsexual nature directed at another person that causes \nreasonable fear or concern for that person’s safety or \nthe safety of others known to them. The harm may be \nphysical, emotional, or psychological, or related to the \npersonal safety, property, education, or employment of \nan individual.  \nStalking can occur physically, (such as watching and \nmonitoring, pursuing or following, making threatening or \nobscene gestures, sending unsolicited gifts) and/or \nelectronically (for example, continuously commenting or \ncontacting via social media, surveillance, letters, text  \nmessages, emails or phonecalls).  \nVoyeurism Surreptitiously observing another individual’s nudity or \nsexual activity without the knowledge and consent of all \nparties involved. \nDistribution of intimate images Non-consensual sharing, distribution or streaming of \nimages, video or audio recording of sexual activity or \nnudity, without the knowledge and consent of all parties \ninvolved, or the threat to do the same. \nIndecent exposure Exposing one’s genitals and/or breasts or inducing \nanother to expose their own genitals and/or breasts in \nnon-consensual circumstances, in person or \nelectronically. \nConsent Consent is a voluntary, ongoing, active and conscious \nagreement to engage in the sexual activity in question. \nConsent or a \"yes\" that is obtained through pressure, \ncoercion, force, or threats is not voluntary consent.  \nThere is no consent when: \n·         it is given by someone else \n·         the person is unconscious, sleeping, highly \nintoxicated or high, or otherwise lacks the capacity to \nconsent \n·         it was obtained through the abuse of a position of \npower, trust or authority \n·         the person does not say \"yes\", says \"no\", or \nimplies \"no\" through words or behaviours. \n·         the person changes their mind.  \nConsent cannot be implied (for example, by a current or \npast relationship, by consent to another activity, or by \nfailure to say “no” or resist). In addition, consent cannot \nbe given in advance of sexual activity that is expected \nto occur at a later time. It is the responsibility of the \nperson wanting to engage in sexual activity to obtain \nclear consent from the other. \nRetaliation Taking, attempting to take or threatening to take any \nadverse action or retribution of any kind against anyone \ninvolved in a sexual violence process including the \nperson who made a disclosure or complaint, and \nanyone involved in an investigation or resolution of an \nallegation of sexual violence, or friends or family \nmembers of the same.  \nRetaliation can take many forms, including threats, \nintimidation, pressuring, harassment, continued abuse, \nviolence or other forms or threats of harm to others, \nand in varying modes, including in person and in \nelectronic communication or through third parties. \nRetaliation can also include adverse employment or \neducational actions made or taken against an individual \nbecause of participation in the reporting, investigating \nand/or resolution of an alleged violation of this policy, or \nany conduct that would discourage a person from \nengaging in the same. \nRELATED LINKS \nShould a link fail, please contact uappol@ualberta.ca.
