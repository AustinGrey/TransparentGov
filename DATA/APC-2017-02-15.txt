            "Description": "Purpose of the Proposal: To recommend approval of the Sexual Violence Policy, Procedure and related Information documents. Discussion: Dr Costopoulos noted that the proposal, drafted with extensive feedback and consultation, represents an institutional statement of principles surrounding awareness, survivor support, and due process for those accused of sexual violence. A member proposed a friendly amendment to the definition of Distribution of Intimate Images to include child pornography to include “images prohibited by law”. It was agreed that this amendment would be included subject to the approval of the Chair of the GFC Campus Law Review Committee (CLRC). GFC Secretary’s Note: Following the meeting, the Chair of CLRC and General Counsel were consulted and did not approve the amendment to the definition, citing the following rationale: 1. No amendment is required to the definition in the Policy because conduct that violates any municipal by-law, Provincial or Federal statute or regulation is already included within Section 30.3.6(2) of the Code of Student Behaviour - Breach of Rules External to the Code. 2. Amending the definition in this manner runs contrary to statutory interpretive principles. 3. Related to #2, the proposed amendment does not align with the unifying concept/essential element outlined in the definition of Distribution of Intimate Images. That is, all of the prohibitions apply to non-consensual distribution. To add child pornography or other images \"prohibited by law\" fundamentally alters the nature of the conduct that is intended to be captured by the definition. [Children cannot consent to the distribution of their images, especially pornographic ones]. The proposal therefore stands as presented.",

Discussion: The Chair noted that, upon request of a member, ENGG 490 and EDU 211 would be extracted from the main Motion to be considered individually. Ms Collins reported that the proposal includes course- and program-specific fees levied by departments for experiential learning opportunities such as field trips. She explained that the Registrar’s Advisory Committee on Fees (RACF) reviews these items each year and that students are represented on RACF. She noted that these items require final approval from the Board of Governors. During the discussion, members identified that some of the items, such as EAS 237, represented a substantial increase in costs. In response, it was reported that in previous years, some of these items had significant industry supplementation and that without those resources they would be impossible to maintain. A member also sought clarification surrounding the notion that an increase in deposit amount would increase enrolment, and it was noted that there was indeed evidence to support this for undergraduate students.",

Ideas and discussions will contribute to further discussions and consultation and inform the final report and recommendations which come forward to GFC in April 2017. Discussion: Dr Burshtyn provided the committee with observations made by the GFC Ad Hoc Committee including the range of items covered within the APC mandate, APC’s role in program approval and that of the Academic Standards Committee and the Executive Committee, the role of APC in relation to the GFC Committee on the Learning Environment (CLE) and the GFC Facilities Development Committee (FDC), and the consideration of establishing a specific GFC Research Committee. Members identified a number of items which would benefit from clarification in the current terms of reference including APC’s role in approving new buildings and policies surrounding campus planning, whether APC is the proper body to approve college-level programming, and that members enjoy the range of areas currently within APC’s mandate. Regarding a GFC Research Committee, it was noted that a similar advisory body already reviews institutional research and that it might be disadvantageous to single out research. A member noted that CLE lacks any delegated authority from GFC, and that certain big projects such as the CLE Subcommittee on Attributes and Competencies Final Report, endorsed by the committee in 2013, did not result in any actions by GFC.",

The Policy suite includes key definitions to educate all \nmembers of the university community.   Fundamental principles \nestablished in the policy suite include the importance of believing \nsurvivors when they disclose an experience of sexual violence and \nproviding support, accommodations, interim measures, and information \non filing a formal complaint.  \nIn addition, the proposed policy indicates “The University takes seriously \nits responsibility to reduce sexual violence by fostering a culture of \nconsent and support through education, training and policy.”  The impact \nwill be an increasingly educated and informed community that can better \nhandle disclosures and complaints of sexual violence. \nThe Government of Alberta has made it clear that they expect every \ninstitution to produce a stand-alone policy on sexual violence.  \nReplaces/Revises (eg, policies, \nresolutions) \nN/A \nTimeline/Implementation Date Upon final approval \nEstimated Cost and funding \nsource \nN/A \nNext Steps (ie.: \nCommunications Plan, \nImplementation plans) \nThe University’s central Marketing and Communications office will \ndevelop and execute a communications strategy to inform the campus \nand broader communities.

Overview \na.  Sexual violence is a complex and serious problem in society and on university campuses. Sexual \nviolence can affect individuals of all gender identities, gender expressions, and sexual orientations, as \nwell as those from all ages, abilities, racial, cultural and economic backgrounds. \nb. The University recognizes the harm caused by a culture in which common attitudes, norms and practices \ntolerate, normalize, trivialize, excuse or outright condone sexual violence. Sometimes called rape culture, \nit is perpetuated through images, television, music, jokes, advertising, jargon, words and figures of \nspeech that normalize sexual coercion and shift blame onto those who have experienced sexual violence. \nAs an institution that exists in the context of that culture, the University takes seriously its responsibility to \nreduce sexual violence by fostering a culture of consent and support through education, training and \npolicy. \nc. This policy is guided by the following principles: \ni. the need for safety in the work, study and student residence environment, providing a community \nin which sexual violence is not tolerated, \nii. the inherent dignity of all members of the University community, \niii. the importance of fostering a culture of consent and support through education, training and \npolicy initiatives, \niv. the need to identify and dismantle barriers to making a disclosure and/or complaint,  \nv. access to support for anyone in the University community who discloses that they have \nexperienced or been affected by sexual violence, and \nvi. procedural fairness and support for the parties to formal complaint processes related to sexual \nviolence. \n2. Purpose \nThe purpose of this policy is to state the University’s commitment to addressing sexual violence through \neducation and awareness, providing access to comprehensive support for those who have experienced or \nbeen affected by sexual violence and implementing transparent and fair processes to resolve and adjudicate \ncomplaints of sexual violence. \n  U of A Policies and Procedures On-Line (UAPPOL) \n3. POLICY \na.  It is the policy of the University of Alberta that sexual violence committed by any member of the University \ncommunity is prohibited and constitutes misconduct. Prohibited conduct includes: sexual violence, sexual \nassault, sexual harassment, stalking, indecent exposure, voyeurism, and distribution of intimate \nimages.  \nb. Any member of the University community who discloses having experienced sexual violence will have \naccess to support, whether or not the sexual violence took place on University property or in relation to \nUniversity activities. Where the University has jurisdiction, complaints will be addressed under the \napplicable policies or procedures, including, for example, the Code of Student Behaviour, the \nPostdoctoral Fellow Policy, NASA, AASUA or GSA collective agreements, or other applicable \nemployment contracts and agreements. \n4. COMMITMENT TO THOSE WHO HAVE EXPERIENCED SEXUAL VIOLENCE \na. Sexual violence can have serious and enduring negative effects on physical, mental, emotional and \nspiritual health and wellness. The University recognizes the possible effects of trauma on those who have \nexperienced sexual violence and supports the efforts of individuals to seek support and recover. \nRegardless of where or when it took place, any person who discloses and/or makes a complaint of sexual \nviolence can expect to be: \ni. treated with respect, dignity and compassion, \nii. informed about on- and off-campus resources and supports, \niii. provided with access to support which is non-judgmental, coordinated and comprehensive  \niv. offered options for academic, recreational, University residence and/or workplace modifications \nto prevent further unwanted contact with the subject of the disclosure and ameliorate, to the \nextent possible, the negative impacts of the sexual violence on the person’s working, study or \nstudent residence environment, \nv. provided with information about available complaint processes should they wish to pursue a \ncomplaint within the University and/or to an external law enforcement agency, and  \nvi. offered safety planning assistance. \nb. Subject to the limitations set out in section 6 of this policy, those who experience sexual violence will be \nconsidered the primary decision-maker in matters pertaining to themselves. As such, they can determine \nwhether, to whom and what to disclose, and whether to make a complaint within the University and/or an \nexternal law enforcement agency. \n5. RESPONSIBILITIES \na. The University recognizes its institutional responsibility to: \ni. provide an effective policy and procedures to address and prevent sexual violence, \nii. raise awareness about the policy and procedures and relevant support services on campus \nthrough institution-wide education, \niii. raise awareness of consent, sexual violence, prevention, and appropriate responses to \ndisclosures of sexual violence through institution-wide education, \niv. balance the duty to ensure procedural fairness for any person accused of sexual violence with \nsupport and fairness for the complainant within the University’s complaint processes,  \nv. maintaining safe and neutral mechanisms for individuals to disclose or make a complaint of \nsexual violence, \nvi. ensuring the safety of the working, learning and student residence environment by various \nmeans, including the imposition of interim measures, where appropriate, \nvii. provide coordinated and comprehensive supports for those who disclose sexual violence, and \nviii. ensure that all individuals investigating or adjudicating complaints of sexual violence in any \nUniversity complaints process have appropriate training. \nb. All senior leaders, including the President, Vice-Presidents, Deans, Directors and Chairs and other \nofficers of the University exercise administrative responsibility to implement this policy and the related \nprocedures within their respective areas of responsibility, including by creating, supporting and \n  U of A Policies and Procedures On-Line (UAPPOL) \nmaintaining a work, study and student residence environment that promotes a culture of consent, free \nfrom sexual violence. \nc. All members of the University community are responsible for promoting respect and dignity for each other \nby encouraging a culture of consent; and for contributing to work, study and student residence \nenvironments in which individuals can disclose experiences of sexual violence without fear of disbelief, \ndisrespect or reprisal. \n6. PRIVACY AND CONFIDENTIALITY \na. Privacy and confidentiality are essential for creating an environment where those who have experienced \nsexual violence feel safe in disclosing their experience and seeking support. However, it is important to note \nthat there may be limits to the University’s ability to maintain privacy and confidentiality in some cases, \nincluding where: \ni. there is a likely risk of harm to self or others, or \nii. reporting or action is required or authorized by law or University policy. \nb. Whether or not the University can maintain the privacy and confidentiality of a disclosure will be determined \non a case by case basis, in consultation with relevant University officials. \nc. In relation to complaints, all University complaint processes are confidential. In any complaint process, \nsufficient information, including the identity of the complainant, must and will be disclosed to the accused in \norder to meet the requirements of procedural fairness.  \nd. Whether in the context of a disclosure or a complaint, all parties will be informed of the limits of privacy and \nconfidentiality. In cases where confidentiality cannot be maintained, those affected will be informed and \nsupported throughout the process. In such cases, only necessary information will be disclosed, and only to \nthose with a need to know.  \n7. STATEMENT AGAINST RETALIATION \nRetaliation against any person involved in a disclosure or complaint of sexual violence is prohibited. Where it \nhas jurisdiction, the University will investigate all reports of retaliation in accordance with the appropriate \ncomplaints processes. \n8. BAD FAITH COMPLAINTS \nThe University recognizes the serious nature of complaints made under this policy, and may take disciplinary \naction where allegations of sexual violence are shown to be malicious, fraudulent, and/or vexatious. A \ncomplaint made in good faith is not a violation of this policy even if it is not proven in a complaint process. \n9.

OVERVIEW \na. The University recognizes the difference between a disclosure and a complaint, and is committed to \nresponding to and reducing sexual violence and attending to its effects by providing  \n supports and resources to persons who have experienced sexual violence and to any other member of \nthe University community who has been affected by sexual violence,  \n interim measures to ensure the safety of the University’s learning, working and residence environment, \n processes to fairly adjudicate formal complaints of sexual violence, and \n education and training to the University community about sexual violence and, in particular, to those \ninvestigating and adjudicating complaints of sexual violence.  \nb. The University will consult with University of Alberta Protective Services (UAPS), Human Resource Services, \nlegal, medical, and/or psychological experts and others as appropriate in determining how to act on \ndisclosures or complaints of sexual violence. \n2. PURPOSE \nThe purpose of this procedure is to \n provide guidance to members of the University community on receiving and responding to disclosures of \nsexual violence, \n outline supports, modifications and protections the University may be able to offer to persons who have \nexperienced sexual violence,  \n provide authority for the imposition of interim measures to ensure the safety of the working, learning and \nUniversity residence environment,  \n describe the procedures through which complaints of sexual violence will be addressed and, where \nwarranted, discipline imposed, and  \n address education and training in, and awareness of, sexual violence for the University community \ngenerally and, in particular, for those investigating and adjudicating complaints of sexual violence.  \nPROCEDURE \nThe University’s response to a disclosure will, to the extent possible, be guided by the wishes of the person who \nexperienced the sexual violence. In this regard, in response to a disclosure, the person who experienced sexual \n  U of A Policies and Procedures On-Line (UAPPOL) \nviolence can ask the University to provide supports and resources, facilitate academic, residential, recreation \nand/or work modifications, consider the imposition of interim measures, and initiate an investigation of a complaint \nin accordance with the procedures in applicable agreements or policies. \n3. INTERIM MEASURES \na. Interim measures are non-disciplinary conditions that may be imposed on a person alleged to have committed \nsexual violence. The University may impose interim measures in response to either a disclosure or a \ncomplaint where the allegations would \ni. if proven, constitute sexual violence, and \nii. with regard to all of the circumstances, be a risk to an individual, the community or the integrity of any \npotential investigation. \nb. The purpose of such interim measures is to ensure personal safety, discourage or prevent retaliation, \nprevent further sexual violence, protect confidentiality, minimize disruption to the learning, working or \nUniversity Residence environment and/or preserve the University’s ability to conduct a thorough investigation. \nc. Having regard to all of the circumstances, where interim measures are imposed, they must be, appropriate \nand proportionate to the seriousness of the alleged conduct, and as minimally restrictive as possible to \nachieve their purposes. As a result, interim measures will be based on considerations including, but not \nlimited to: \ni. the reasonable wishes of the person who experienced the sexual violence,  \nii. the nature and/or severity of the alleged conduct, \niii. reasonably credible information about patterns of conduct or previous history of sexual violence or other \nmisconduct, \niv. the potential impact of the measures on the person(s), including on their academic program and/or \nemployment,  \nv. the potential impact of the measures on the learning, working or University Residence environment, \nvi. in the case of employees, in accordance with their relevant collective agreement, and \nvii. any other relevant information.  \nExamples of interim measures can be found in the University’s Sexual Violence Interim Measures Information \nDocument. \nd. The decision to impose interim measures will be made by: \ni. in the case of students, the Vice-Provost and Dean of Students, or designate. \nii. in the case of faculty and staff, the Provost and Vice-President (Academic) and/or the Associate Vice-\nPresident (Human Resources), or designate. \niii. in the case of postdoctoral fellows, the Vice-President (Research) , or designate. \nDecision makers may consult as needed in determining whether to impose interim measures and the nature \nof those measures.  \ne. In all cases, decisions on interim measures must be provided in writing and include: \ni. particulars of the measure(s), \nii. information about the right to request a reconsideration, \niii. information about relevant complaint processes, if applicable, and \niv. referrals to supports and/or services. \nf. The person(s) on whom interim measures are imposed may request a reconsideration from the decision \nmaker after sixty (60) days or such earlier time as agreed to by the decision maker. Further, at any time, on \nthe basis of new information, the decision maker may on his or her own initiative reconsider the interim \nmeasures imposed and renew, revise, or revoke any or all of the measures, or impose additional interim \nmeasures. \n  U of A Policies and Procedures On-Line (UAPPOL) \ng. Interim measures will be re-evaluated when a complaint process is concluded. \n4. PROCEDURES TO ADDRESS COMPLAINTS \na. Complaints of sexual violence will be resolved according to the procedures set out in the University’s \nagreements with the Association of Academic Staff: University of Alberta (AASUA), the Non-Academic Staff \nAssociation (NASA), the Graduate Student Assistantship Collective Agreement, the Postdoctoral Fellows \nDiscipline Procedure, the Code of Student Behaviour, the Residence Agreement, Practicum Intervention \nPolicy, and any other applicable contracts, agreements or policies. \nb. In all cases, use of the procedures at the University does not preclude a report to the appropriate law \nenforcement agency, professional governing body, or pursuing any other civil or other remedy available at \nlaw. \nStudents \nc. Complaints of sexual violence against students will be addressed using procedures outlined in one or more of \nthe following documents. When the person accused in the complaint is:  \ni. a student, the Code of Student Behaviour, \nii. a student living in a University Residence, the Breach of Residence Agreement process,  \niii. a student in a practicum placement, the Practicum Intervention Policy; \niv. a graduate student while appointed in a role as a graduate teaching assistant, graduate research \nassistant or short-term academically-related employment at the time of the offence, the Graduate Student \nAssistantship Collective Agreement. \nAs noted, students may be subject to more than one procedure and may, therefore, be subject to several \nprocedures concurrently.  \nEmployees, postdoctoral fellows and volunteers \nd. Complaints of sexual violence against employees, postdoctoral fellows and volunteers will be resolved \nthrough the following procedures. When the person accused in the complaint is:  \ni. a member of the Non Academic Staff Association (NASA), the processes outlined in the collective \nagreement between the University and NASA;  \ni.ii. or the Association of Academic Staff: University of Alberta (AASUA), the processes outlined in the \napplicable collective agreement between the University and AASUA; \nii.iii. a postdoctoral fellow, the Postdoctoral Fellows Discipline Procedure; \niii.iv. an employee under an employment contract or agreement, but not subject to the above collective \nagreements or Procedure, where no policy or procedure exists and where no procedures are specified in \nthe terms and conditions of their employment, the procedure will be determined on a case-by-case basis, \nensuring that the accused person has the right to: \n1.  an impartial decision-maker, \n2.  know the case to be met, \n3.  an opportunity to respond to the allegations in the complaint, \n4.  be accompanied by an advisor, and \n5.  a timely resolution. \nOthers \ne. When the person accused in a complaint or disclosure is not a member of the University Communityany other \nperson, the University may address the matter through means including, but not limited to, the Trespass to \nPremises Act of Alberta or the Petty Trespass Act of Alberta, reports to the appropriate law enforcement \nagency or professional governing body. \n5. COMPLAINANT RIGHTS IN COMPLAINTS PROCESS \n  U of A Policies and Procedures On-Line (UAPPOL) \na. The applicable procedures for investigating and adjudicating complaints of sexual violence are required to \nadhere to the principles of procedural fairness. Adherence to such principles is necessary to ensure that \npersons accused of sexual violence are protected by receiving a fair adjudication. At the same time, the \nprocedures for investigating and adjudicating complaints of sexual violence must also be conducted with due \nregard to their effects on the complainant. Having such regard is necessary in recognition that investigatory \nand adjudicative processes can themselves cause additional trauma to a complainant. In balancing these \nobligations, investigators and adjudicators will be mindful to conduct their functions in a way that reduces, to \nthe extent possible, the risk of additional harm to the complainant, while ensuring procedural fairness for the \nperson accused in the complaint. \nb. Without limiting the foregoing, where not already provided for in any complaints process related to sexual \nviolence at the Universitybut subject to the provisions of any applicable collective agreement, the complainant \nwill have the right to: \ni. be accompanied by a support person throughout their participation in any investigatory or disciplinary \nproceedings, \nii. be informed of, make and respond to procedural requests, \niii. make oral or written representations on their own behalf, through their support person or other \nappropriate party, regarding impact and sanction, \niv. receive a copy of the written reasons for the decision. \n6. PREVENTION, EDUCATION AND TRAINING \na. Further information about: \n receiving and managing a disclosure of sexual violence, can be found in the University’s Responding to a \nDisclosure of Sexual Assault, available at https://www.ualberta.ca/current-students/sexual-assault-\ncentre/responding \n support services and resources for persons affected by sexual violence can be found in the University’s \nOptions, Services and Resources for Those who have Experienced Sexual Violence Information \nDocument. \n the steps or measures the University can take, including modifications to academic program(s), University \nresidence, recreational or other programs, or work environment, in response to a disclosure of sexual \nviolence can be found in the University’s Options, Services and Resources for Those who have \nExperienced Sexual Violence Information Document. \nb. The University will provide education to the entire University community on sexual violence including, but not \nlimited to, policy awareness, consent and responding to disclosures.  \ni. Additional workshops will be offered for those more likely to receive disclosures. \nii. Training in bystander intervention, provided on a voluntary basis to students and staff. \nc. All persons (i) investigating complaints of sexual violence, and (ii) adjudicating complaints of sexual violence \nin the complaint resolution procedures outlined above must have appropriate training. \nd. Information on appropriate training can be found in the University’s Sexual Violence Education and Training \nInformation Document. \nDEFINITIONS \nDefinitions should be listed in the sequence they occur in the document (i.e. not alphabetical). \nAny definitions listed in the following table apply to this document only with no implied or intended \ninstitution-wide use.

Resources and Services Information Document     Page 1 \nMost Recent Editorial Date: November 15, 2016 \nOptions, Resources and Services  \nfor Those who have Experienced Sexual Violence Information Document \nIntroductory Note: \nThe University of Alberta respects each person's right to make their own decisions regarding their personal recovery after sexual violence. This \ndocument is intended to provide a non-exhaustive list of the various options available so that all students, staff, postdoctoral fellows and faculty \ncan assist in making appropriate referrals upon receiving a disclosure or make informed decisions for themselves after experiencing sexual \nviolence.  \nIndividual reactions to sexual violence will differ greatly, and a person's decision about how to respond to an experience of sexual violence may \nchange over time. Whether the result of a disclosure or a complaint, the University can assist with some of those responses, including providing \nacademic, work or University residence modifications, safety planning, personal support, making a complaint or other options that meet the goals \nof the Sexual Violence policy and related procedures.  \nSome may need a more comprehensive and coordinated response. The SVRT (Sexual Violence Response Team) is convened when an individual \ndiscloses that they have experienced sexual violence, and may need more than one modification to meet the goals of the Sexual Violence policy. \nIt is designed to provide access to multiple options, resources and responses without the individual having to approach each service separately.  \nIt should be understood that mediation is not appropriate for situations involving sexual violence. Mediation is a conflict resolution mechanism that \npresumes all parties have an equal role in resolving a conflict. Sexual violence is not a conflict, but a harm inflicted on another person. Mediation \nintroduces a significant risk of additional harm to the person to whom the violence was done and should never be considered an option in cases of \nsexual violence. \nWHAT ARE MY OPTIONS? \nPersonal Support | Medical Assistance | Safety | Modifications – Academic/Work/Living | Complaints | Other Resources and Services \nOptions, Resources and Services Information Document     Page 2 \nPersonal\tSupport\t\nOPTION HOW DO I DO THIS?

As one example, if a \nvictim did not scream or fight or say “no,” the assumption may be that there must have been implicit consent. These \nassumptions can be held by anyone receiving a disclosure, investigating, or adjudicating a complaint, or even by \nthose who have experienced sexual violence themselves. Education on these and other topics is designed to correct \nthese misconceptions. In addition, research on the potential effects of trauma on memory, recall and behaviour sheds \nnew light on methods for interviewing those who have experienced trauma. \nThe goals of education, bystander intervention and other training are to help those who experience sexual violence \nfeel safer in disclosing and/or making a complaint and seeking support; ensure that those who receive disclosures \nknow how to support and refer; allow investigators to use trauma-informed interview techniques in order to get the \nbest information possible from complainants; and ensure that decision-makers in complaint processes are able to \nappropriately interpret the evidence before them. Below is a non-exhaustive list of selected training and education \nopportunities. Any other relevant training should also be considered, as appropriate. \nFOR THE UNIVERSITY COMMUNITY \nThe resources below are available to members of the University community at no cost and provide education and \ntraining in the areas of understanding sexual assault, consent, bystander intervention, gender based violence, effects \nof trauma and trauma-informed interviewing.  \nSexual Assault Centre (no cost) \n Videos: Understanding Sexual Assault \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3j3qgLRQaIw&list=PL2V1RRG3M1rTKPuhw2eHWvVlVcrBcDKsH&index\n=1  \n Online guide: How to Respond to a Disclosure of Sexual Violence https://www.ualberta.ca/current-\nstudents/sexual-assault-centre/responding \n Working for Change workshops: Email edcoord@ualberta.ca  \nthe Landing (no cost) \nThe Gender Based Violence Prevention Program (GBVPP) is a campus and community-wide initiative designed to \nincrease awareness, education, communication, inclusion and safety.

[▲Top] \nDisclose/Disclosure A verbal or written report or account by any person to a member of the \nUniversity community that they have experienced sexual violence. \nComplaint Usually a written report or statement alleging sexual violence \nmisconduct made to a University official under a University process for \nthe purpose of initiating an investigation and resolution process. \nSexual violence Any sexual act or act of a sexual nature, or act targeting sexuality, \nwhether physical or psychological, committed without consent. This \nincludes, but is not limited to the following: \na. Sexual Assault  - Any form of sexual contact without consent. \nThis can include unwanted or forced kissing, fondling, vaginal \nor anal penetration or touching, or oral sexual contact. \nEducation and Training Information Document   Page 4 \nb. Sexual Harassment - as defined in the UAPPOL \nDiscrimination, Harassment and Duty to Accommodate Policy. \nc. Stalking - Repeated unwanted contact or communication \ndirected at another person that causes reasonable fear or \nconcern for that person’s safety or the safety of others known \nto them. The harm may be physical, emotional, or \npsychological, or related to the personal safety, property, \neducation, or employment of an individual.  \nStalking can occur physically (such as watching and \nmonitoring, pursuing or following, making threatening or \nobscene gestures, sending unsolicited gifts), electronically (for \nexample, continuously commenting or contacting via social \nmedia, surveillance, letters, text messages, emails or phone \ncalls), and/or through a third party.  \nd. Indecent Exposure - Exposing one’s genitals, buttocks and/or \nbreasts or inducing another to expose their own genitals, \nbuttocks and/or breasts in non-consensual circumstances, in \nperson or electronically. \ne.

Inducing intoxication, impairment or incapacity for the purpose \nof making another person vulnerable to non-consensual sexual \nactivity. \nh. Other analogous conduct. \nConsent Consent is a voluntary, ongoing, active and conscious agreement to engage in the sexual activity in question. Consent or a “yes” that is \nobtained through pressure, coercion, force, threats or by inducing \nintoxication, impairment or incapacity is not voluntary consent. Silence \nor ambiguity do not constitute consent. \nAdditionally, there is no consent when: \n it is given by someone else. \n the person is unconscious, sleeping, highly intoxicated or high, \nor otherwise lacks the capacity to consent. \n it was obtained through the abuse of a position of power, trust \nor authority. \n the person does not signify “yes”, says “no” or implies “no” \nEducation and Training Information Document   Page 5 \nthrough words or behaviours. \n the person changes their mind and withdraws their consent. \nConsent cannot be implied (for example, by a current or past \nrelationship, by consent to another activity, or by failure to say “no” or \nresist). In addition, consent cannot be given in advance of sexual \nactivity that is expected to occur at a later time. It is the responsibility of \nthe person wanting to engage in sexual activity to obtain clear consent \nfrom the other and to recognize that consent can be withdrawn at any \ntime. \nComplainant An individual who makes a complaint under a University process. \nRELATED LINKS \nShould a link fail, please contact uappol@ualberta.ca.

EAS 237 will be delivered offsite as a field course, and so \nthere are substantial travel and accommodation costs incurred for students, teaching assistants and faculty. \nHistorically, similar courses (e.g. EAS 234) operate at more than $1,850 per student (Appendix 1). We request a \nceiling of $2,400 (range $600 to $2,400) to provide flexibility of venue (e.g. study Geology outside of western \nCanada). We see this flexibility as highly beneficial to the student, as we can select the most appropriate venues \nfor field-based learning and establish long-term flexibility. \n6\nPut N/A in any boxes that do not apply \nProposer \nFaculty/Department  Earth and Atmospheric Science \nDean/Chair Jonathan Schaeffer / Stephen Johnston \nPrimary Contact (Name, phone \nnumber, and e-mail) \nMurray Gingras, (780) 492 1963, mgingras@ualberta.ca \nSecondary Contact (Name, \nphone number, and e-mail) \nMary-Jane Turnell, (780) 492 3216, mturnell@ualberta.ca \nItem \nPurpose of Fee (what it is to be \nused for) \nThe fee is to cover the cost of transportation, accommodation and board, \nfor EAS field schools.  \nProposed Amount $600.00 to $2,400.00 \nPrevious Fee Amount (if this is \na new fee, please indicate that \nhere) \nNew Course \nRequested Implementation \nDate \nMay 1, 2017 \nThe Impact of the Fee (number \nof students affected, etc.) \nThe fee increase will apply to ~30 students in any given year.  \nCollected Centrally or by \nDepartment \nBy Department \nCourse Information (if fee is attached to a course) \nCourse Name(s)  EAS 237 \nRequired Course(s)   \nX No \nNew or Existing Course(s) Yes \nNew or Existing Program \n(include name) \nCourse Description(s) *3 (fi 6) (either term).

Currently \nsubmitted for consideration to ASC, FoE has put forward, with the support of the Faculties of Arts, Science and \nthe School of Business, minors for engineering students. The drive for these minors was supported by \nengineering students. A survey conducted by ESS, answered by 920 of their 4300 eligible members (21.4%), \nfound that 92.3% supported having minors for engineering students. 82.7% indicated that they would undertake a \nminor if available to them; the top three choices were Business, Science and Arts. \nWorking with the School of Business, a tailored minor was developed for engineering students. One of the \ncourses, offered by FoE, was developed as a capping offering that encompassed engineering experience and \nknowledge with key core elements of business learnings complemented with responsible leadership.    \nProposed course: This new course, ENGG 490 – Engineering Leadership Lab, focuses on learning through \npresentations and discussions with leaders on topics including responsible leadership, creating sustainable and \ninnovative organisations, and entrepreneurship.  \nBenefits: The benefit to the students is gaining valuable insight critical to their term work in the course and future \ncareer from veritable expert sources. The small discussion groups (20 students to 1 leader, followed by break out \ndiscussion) is unique for an engineering course and an extraordinary intimate learning experience.  Students will \nalso gain important social and networking skills.  The course will have at least 4 guest leaders per offering.  \nFees will be used to pay for the travel and accommodations of the guest speakers. The proposal ensures that the \nstudents get a truly unique engineering experience in their business minor.   \nSimilarity to other courses requiring mandatory instructional support fees: This proposal is similar to other \ncourses where students pay fees to attend movies, plays or other live performances.  However, the benefit of the \ninteraction with the leaders is extraordinary, exceeds the value of watching a performance; often people will pay in \nexcess of $100 to see such speakers.  \nThe proposed fees will impact 20 students per year who have decided to invest in their future by taking a one of a \nkind business minor.   \n9\nPut N/A in any boxes that do not apply \nProposer \nFaculty/Department  Engineering \nDean/Chair Fraser Forbes, Dean \nPrimary Contact (Name, phone \nnumber, and e-mail) \nJason Carey, Associate Dean (Programs and Planning), Faculty of \nEngineering, 492-0501, jason.carey@ualberta.ca \nSecondary Contact (Name, \nphone number, and e-mail) \nMarcus Ivey, Director (Programs and Planning), Ivey@ualberta.lca  \nItem \nPurpose of Fee (what it is to be \nused for) \nFees will be used to pay for the travel and accommodations of the guest \nspeakers.

Confirmation deposits \nare posted directly to a student’s account and applied against future tuition assessments.  \nThere are a number of reasons why we are requesting this increase.  One main reason is \nto help reduce the number of students who pay the confirmation deposit but ultimately \ndecide to attend another academic institution.  These students negatively impact our pre-\nMBA Orientation, where we have spent significant and time resources planning on a \ncertain attendance and then have to adjust quickly for non-attendees.  Within our full-time \nMBA program, we have seen 5-6 students per year who pay the confirmation deposit and \ndo not end up attending the University of Alberta or deferring their admission to the \nfollowing year.  A larger confirmation deposit would also help our International students in \ntheir visa applications as a larger amount of funds on account with a University would be \na positive in evaluating visa applications.  \nPut N/A in any boxes that do not apply \nProposer \nFaculty/Department  Alberta School of Business (since this is a graduate-level degree, the \nprogram is offered through the Faculty of Graduate Studies and \nResearch) \nDean/Chair Dr. Joseph Doucet, Dean, Alberta School of Business \nPrimary Contact (Name, phone \nnumber, and e-mail) \nDr. Michael Maier, Associate Dean, Alberta School of Business; 780-\n248-1275-; msmaier@ualberta.ca \nSecondary Contact (Name, \nphone number, and e-mail) \nChris Lynch, Director, Alberta School of Business, 780-492-5877; \nclynch@ualberta.ca \nItem \nPurpose of Fee (what it is to be \nused for) \nStudent confirmation deposit, ultimately applied to student tuition \nProposed Amount $1,500 \nPrevious Fee Amount (if this is $500 \n32\nmailto:msmaier@ualberta.ca\nmailto:clynch@ualberta.ca\na new fee, please indicate that \nhere) \nRequested Implementation \nDate \nOctober 1, 2017 \nThe Impact of the Fee (number \nof students affected, etc.) \n~150 students each year would pay the increased deposit, we anticipate \n1-2 would end up forfeiting the deposit.  \nCollected Centrally or by \nDepartment \nCentrally      \n  Course Information (if fee is attached to a course) \nCourse Name(s)  N/A \nRequired Course(s)   \n Yes \n No \nThe course/program is on or off \ncampus \n On-Campus \n Off-Campus \nNew or Existing Course(s) N/A \nNew or Existing Program \n(include name) \nN/A \nCourse Description(s) N/A \nDetails \nEstimated Costs (Budget \ninformation may be included \nhere or as an attachment) \nOur expectation is that this increase would have a minimal financial \nimpact to both our program and to students.  For the vast majority of \nstudents who pay the confirmation deposit, it would simply be applied to \ntheir tuition and would not be an additional expense.  With an increased \ncommitment required from students, we expect the confirmation deposit \nto reduce the number of students who pay the confirmation deposit and \nultimately forfeit the amount.  We would also consider the case for \nstudents who are unable to attend due to extenuating circumstances \nand, where warranted, be open to refunding their confirmation deposit.  \nUltimately, we expect that the financial impact to our program would be \nunder $5,000 per year. \nExplanatory Notes For comparison, the confirmation deposit required by peer MBA \nprograms, and the proportion of the total tuition this amount would \nrepresent are as follows:  \nUniversity of Toronto: $5,000 (5% of total tuition) \nQueen’s University: $5,000 (6% of total tuition) \nYork University: $3,000 (4% of total tuition) \nUniversity of British Columbia: $2,500 (5% of total tuition) \nUniversity of Alberta (current): $500 (2% of total tuition) \nUniversity of Alberta (proposed): $1,500 (5% of total tuition) \nRouting (For Mandatory Student Instructional Support Fees and Non-Instructional Fees) \nConsultative Route \n(parties who have seen the \nproposal prior to Registrar’s \nAdvisory Committee on Fees \nand in what capacity) \nN/A \nStudent Group Consultative N/A \n33\nRoute \nAdvisory Route (RACF) Include \ndates \n September 27, 2016 \nApproval Route* (Governance)  \n*The approval process is \ninitiated in January for the next \nacademic year  \nGFC Academic Planning Committee (APC) \nBoard Finance and Property Committee (BFPC) \nBoard of Governors (BG) \nFinal Approver Board of Governors  \n34\nItem No. 7 \nGFC ACADEMIC PLANNING COMMITTEE \nFor the Meeting of February 15, 2017 \n OUTLINE OF ISSUE \nAction Item \nAgenda Title: University of Alberta’s Comprehensive Institutional Plan (CIP) (2017-2020): Budget and \nCapital Plan \nMotion:  THAT the GFC Academic Planning Committee recommend, with delegated authority from General \nFaculties Council, that the Board of Governors approve Appendix A: Financial and Budget Information, and \nAppendix F: Capital Plan, of the University of Alberta’s Comprehensive Institutional Plan (2017-2020), as set \nforth in Attachments 1 and 2. \nItem   \nAction Requested Approval Recommendation   \nProposed by President and Vice-Chancellor, David Turpin; Provost and Vice-\nPresident (Academic) Steven Dew; Vice-President (Finance and \nAdministration) Gitta Kulczycki; Vice-President (Facilities and \nOperations) Andrew Sharman; Vice-President (University Relations) \nJacqui Tam; Vice-President (Advancement) Heather McCaw; and Vice-\nPresident (Research) Lorne Babiuk \nPresenter Provost and Vice-President (Academic) Steven Dew; Vice-President \n(Finance and Administration) Gitta Kulczycki; Vice-President (Facilities \nand Operations) Andrew Sharman \nDetails \nResponsibility President and Vice-Chancellor, David Turpin \nThe Purpose of the Proposal is \n(please be specific) \nThis item presents the Budget and Capital Plan components of the CIP \nfor approval.

Through the implementation of its strategic \nplan, the university is contributing to the achievement of the ministry’s priorities of accessibility, \naffordability, quality, coordination and accountability. As a major economic driver in the province, \nwith government’s commitment of stable and predictable funding, the university will play a \ncritical role in buffering the Alberta economy from other sectors in the economy currently facing \nchallenges. \nThe U of A’s 2017-2018 consolidated budget (see Table 1) reflects the entire enterprise, \nincluding unrestricted and restricted funds. Funding for general operations is fully unrestricted \nwithin the consolidated budget. Funding for ancillary operations remains within those entities \nwhile the majority of research revenues, philanthropic sources of revenue, and capital project \nfunding are fully restricted. In an effort to provide full transparency of the university’s budgets, \nTable 2 on page 11 provides a breakdown of the consolidated budget by fund. \nFor 2016–2017, the university is forecasting at year-end a consolidated excess of revenue over \nexpense of $35 million a variance of $2.6 million below budget. Consolidated revenue is \nestimated to be $20.2 million lower than budgeted, while consolidated expense is estimated to \nbe $17.6 million lower than budgeted. The majority of the excess funds are restricted and \ntherefore can only be used for the purpose for which they have been granted. \nFor 2017-2018, the consolidated budget reflects an excess of revenue over expense of $16.4 \nmillion on budgeted revenue of $1,919.1 million and budgeted expense of $1,902.7 million.  The \n$16.4 million excess of revenue over expense is equal to less than one per cent of the \nuniversity’s budgeted consolidated revenue and is driven almost exclusively by excess of \nrevenue over expense within the restricted funds. For example, endowment funds and the \ncapitalized interest applicable to the endowment funds must remain intact in perpetuity and are \nunavailable for general operational spending. \nThe Statement of Operations and Expense by Function (consolidated budget) prepared under \nthe Public Sector Accounting Standards, and the Statement of Cash Flows are presented in \ntables 5 and 6 found on pages 17 and 18. \nConsolidated revenue \nBudgeted revenue for 2017-2018 is $1,919.1 million. As illustrated in Figure 1, 51.1 per cent or \n3 \nCOMPREHENSIVE INSTITUTIONAL PLAN - DRAFT \n$980.9 million comes from the Government of Alberta, mostly through the Campus Alberta \ngrant, sponsored research funding, and capital funding. Of the $980.9 million, $628 million \nrepresents the Campus Alberta Grant, the primary source of unrestricted funding for the \nuniversity’s day-to-day operating activity and as reflected in the operating fund (see Table 2). \nThe 2017-2018 budget has been prepared based on an assumption of a 2.0 per cent increase to \nthe Campus Alberta grant or the equivalent of $12.3 million.  \nGiven the current fiscal challenges facing the province, forecasting a 2.0 per cent increase to the \nCampus Alberta grant is not without its risks.  Given government’s tremendous commitment to \nsupport higher education and the university’s importance to diversifying the provincial economy, \nthe university has factored in this increase.  However, the university has also developed budget \nscenarios with no change to the grant and a 2 per cent decrease to the grant.    \nThe federal and other government revenue of $216.8 million largely reflects the funding received \nby the university in support of its research mandate, and is its third largest source of revenue. \nThis revenue is budgeted to be $33.2 million higher than the 2016-17 budget. This increase in \nresearch funding is driven primarily by the federal government’s investment in higher education \nthrough the Strategic Initiative Funding (SIF) program. The balance of the budgeted research \nfunding is directly linked to the university’s overall success in securing Tri-Council research \ngrants and grants from other organizations and entities.   \nTuition and related fees are budgeted at $329.9 million and, at 17.2 per cent, represent the \nsecond-largest source of consolidated revenue and is budgeted to be slightly higher than 2016-\n2017 budgeted revenue.  Tuition and related fees include all instructional fees, market modifiers, \nprogram fee differentials, international differential fees and non-instructional fees. In October \n2016 the provincial government announced a continuation of the tuition freeze to 2017-2018 for \nregulated tuition fees and Mandatory Non-Instructional Fees (MNIFs).  This budget has been \nprepared assuming no backfill funding to offset the tuition freeze. In December 2016, the Board \nof Governors approved a 3.02 per cent increase to international student tuition fees as well as \nan additional increase of $4,000 to all full-time graduate programs not including cost recovery \nprograms and not including graduate based Physical Therapy, Occupational Therapy, and \nSpeech Therapy programs.  This $4,000 increase will be offset by an equal amount of financial \nsupport provided to international graduate students. The Board also approved an increase in \ninternational differential fees in the Integrated Petroleum Geosciences program.    \nThrough extensive consultation with the students, the university developed an agreed to \nAcademic Price Index (API). The API is a prospective calculation used in determining the \nincreasing costs of the university’s operations. The API is a weighted calculation based on the \nmajor operating fund expenditure categories of salaries, benefits, supplies, utilities and \nmaintenance. The university’s API for 2017-2018 was calculated at 3.02 per cent.  Developed \noriginally to determine the annual increases in MNIFs, the API was used to set international \ntuition increases.  Unlike the Alberta Consumer Price Index (CPI), the API basket of services is \ntied directly to the university’s primary cost drivers. The university believes that the development \nof a province-wide API could be of value as government undertakes its current review of the \npost-secondary sector funding model and tuition fee regulation. The university has used the API \ncalculation methodology to forecast future international tuition fee increases. However, as \nalways the university continues to closely monitor overall program costs, market demand and \ntuition levels for international students at competing institutions to determine whether additional \nadjustments in international tuition should be made.  \nThe fourth-largest source of revenue is sales of services and products at $206.1 million. The \n4 \nCOMPREHENSIVE INSTITUTIONAL PLAN - DRAFT \nmajority of sales of services and products are generated through the university’s ancillary \noperations such as parking and the university’s housing and food service operations. Increased \nrevenue through ancillary operations is driven by forecast growth such as increased residence \ncapacity as well as rate increases for residence services and parking as approved by the Board \nin December, 2016. However, the demand for residence spaces is starting to soften in response \nto rental market conditions, which could impact revenues from ancillary operations. \nThe other sources of consolidated revenue for 2017-2018 include grants and donations of $117 \nmillion and investment income of $68.2 million. Changes in donations is directly tied to the \nuniversity’s philanthropic activities and can be influenced significantly by large single donations \nand economic conditions. It is important to note that the majority of donations are restricted and \ncan only be used for the purposes designated.  Investment income is driven by the overall value \nof the university’s restricted endowments, its short-term investments as well as changes in \ninterest rates and the performance of the university’s investment portfolios. \nFigure 1. Consolidated Revenue Budget 2017 – 2018 by source \nConsolidated expense \nFor 2017-2018, consolidated expense is budgeted at $1,902.7 million.  \nAs Figure 2 illustrates, investments in salaries and benefits to maintain teaching, research, and \nother critical activities accounts for over $1.1 billion or 60.0 per cent of total expense. This \nexpense factors in negotiated collective agreement salary increases to faculty and staff.  In \naddition, the university must also budget for the regulated and inflationary increases to statutory \nand non-statutory benefits such as supplementary health plans. Adjustments for increased \npension plan contributions in response to unfunded pension plan liabilities have also been \nfactored in.   \n5 \nCOMPREHENSIVE INSTITUTIONAL PLAN - DRAFT \nThe university’s next largest expense is materials, supplies, and services. Budgeted at $311.3 \nmillion, these expenses provide essential support across the campuses, including information \nservices and technology, research expenditures, library resources, and central expenditures \nsuch as insurance premiums. This expense line also includes the costs of goods sold and \nrecovered, largely within ancillary operations. In budgeting for these expense items, the \nuniversity continues to face the challenge whereby inflation within higher education as reflected \nby the Academic Price Index (API), significantly exceeds general inflationary increases as \nrepresented by the Alberta Consumer Price Index (CPI). Reasons why the API is higher than the \nCPI include library collections which are not only impacted by general inflationary increases but \nalso the value of the Canadian dollar relative to the US dollar, in which most library purchases \nare made.  For 2017-2018 the library estimates serial and monograph inflation of between 2.5 \nand 6.0 per cent (on a $25 million collections budget) and an additional currency impact of $1.7 \nmillion.  Information technology is forecasting inflation increases of 6.2 per cent on contracts and \nFacilities and Operations is forecasting average inflation increases of 5.0 per cent including the \nimpact of the increased minimum wage. The university has estimated that for the 15-month \nperiod of January 1, 2017 to March 31, 2018 the carbon levy will increase the university’s utility \ncosts by a minimum of $2.5 million.  When fully implemented the carbon levy will increase the \nuniversity’s utility costs by an estimated $6 million or the equivalent of a 1 per cent grant \nadjustment to the university’s 2017-18 Campus Alberta Grant.  \nA further significant expense in the consolidated budget is $178.5 million for the amortization of \ncapital assets. Amortization is an annual expense that is calculated based on the estimated \nuseful life of the asset. These assets include buildings, scientific and computing equipment, \nsoftware, and learning resources. \nFor 2017-2018, scholarships and bursaries expense are budgeted at $89.2 million.  This \nrepresents a $2.1 million or 2.4 per cent increase over the 2016-17 budget and the university’s \ncontinuing commitment to invest in its students particularly those who require financial \nassistance to attend the university. \n6 \nCOMPREHENSIVE INSTITUTIONAL PLAN - DRAFT \nFigure 2. Consolidated Expense Budget 2017 - 2018 by type \nOperating fund investment priorities \nThe operating fund (see Table 2) is used to support the primary teaching and learning activities \nof the university. It is also within the operating fund that strategic investments are made to \nadvance For the Public Good and its five strategic goals of Build, Experience, Excel, Engage \nand Sustain. \nThe operating fund is prepared under Public Sector Accounting Standards and must reflect \nlosses that are incurred or recoveries that are made including re-evaluations as a result of \nchanges in market conditions. The $9.3 million operating excess that is shown in the operating \nfund is the result of re-measurement of the university's unfunded benefits liability, which is driven \nprimarily by pension plans.  The improving financial markets contributed to this $9.3 million re-\nevaluation gain.  There remains a significant unfunded liability within the pension plans, \ntherefore the $9.3 million does not reflect cash on hand and cannot be used to invest in new \nexpenditures or offset any increases in existing expenditures. \nThe consolidated budget has been prepared based on two fundamental assumptions.  One, the \nuniversity will receive a 2 per cent increase to the Campus Alberta grant or approximately $12.3 \nmillion in the operating fund. Secondly, that Faculties and units will continue to be responsible \nfor funding their portion of collective agreement increases which represents approximately $12.0 \nmillion.  Many of the Faculties and units will need to reduce other expenditure lines, eliminate \nvacancies, lay off staff or draw down their positive carry forwards in order to fund the costs \nassociated with their staff. The net result is that Faculties and units will need to re-allocate \nexpenditure lines within their budgets to fund  salaries. \n7 \nCOMPREHENSIVE INSTITUTIONAL PLAN - DRAFT \nAlthough the provincial government has committed to investing in higher education and \nproviding predicable funding, given the government’s current fiscal situation, the 2 per cent grant \nincrease assumption has some risk. Within the operating fund, priority areas identified for \nsupport include sustaining ongoing commitments to faculty recruitment and retention, partial \nfunding of inflationary pressures associated with the university’s library collections, and base \nfundraising support to sustain current operations and resulting donation levels.  Final allocation \ndecisions will not be made until after the provincial budget is tabled and the ministry confirms the \nadjustment to the University’s Campus Alberta grant. \nIn the event that the university gets less than a 2 per cent grant increase or its grant is reduced, \nthe university will need to apply budget cuts across the institution in addition to the impact of the \nFaculties and units absorbing across the board (ATB) salary settlements and merit. Based on a \nscenario where there is no change to the grant, a budget cut up to 2.2 per cent would be \nrequired.  This would be in addition to the average impact of 1.7 per cent across the operating \nfund as the Faculties and units absorb ATB and merit, for a combined impact up to 3.9 per cent.  \nA 2 per cent cut to the Campus Alberta grant would have a combined impact of up to a 5.5 per \ncent cut. Every 1 per cent cut to the operating fund is equal to $7.5 million which equates to48 \nfaculty positions, or 106 support positions or the elimination of over 1000 class sections.    \nPublic sector institutions like the University of Alberta play a critical role in the economy from \nmany different perspectives.  First, the university attracts hundreds of millions of dollars from \noutside Alberta largely for research, creating high paying professional employment opportunities \nand subsequent spin off benefits to the Alberta economy.  Secondly, it attracts thousands of \nstudents from around the world further bolstering the economy. As a world leading research \ninstitution the university supports diversification of the economy. Finally, it is educating tens of \nthousands of students who will create further economic benefits and assist in economic \ndiversification.  For these reasons and others, providing the necessary increases to the Campus \nAlberta grant is a sound investment as the University of Alberta functions as a critical buffer to \nthe economy while other industries and sectors continue to adjust to the current economic \nenvironment.    \nConsolidated budget highlights and sensitivities \nThe university prepares its fiscal estimates and final budgets using a comprehensive integrated \nplanning and budget process, involving key stakeholders from across the institution. Key budget \nassumptions and sensitivities are cornerstones of the university’s multi-year budgeting process. \nThe goal is to achieve improved accuracy in forecasting elements of the budget and provide \ncommon assumptions for budget planners across the university. \n2017-18 budget highlights \nKey revenue highlights include: \n● a 2.0 per cent increase to the Campus Alberta grant.  \n● maintaining general tuition increases and MNIF at 2014-2015 levels (due to government \ntuition freeze) while increasing international student tuition fees by 3.02 per cent for \n2017-2018 \n● a $4,000 per full-time student increase to international graduate tuition offset by $4,000 \nin financial support (with some program exclusions) \n8 \nCOMPREHENSIVE INSTITUTIONAL PLAN - DRAFT \n● tuition increase to the Integrated Petroleum Geosciences graduate program \n● continuation of a low interest rate environment with endowment returns budgeted at 6.97 \nper cent \n● modest growth in research funding \n● modest growth in investment income \n● slight decline in capital funding \nKey expenditure highlights include: \n● academic staff negotiated ATB salary increase of 1.50 per cent, with an average merit of \n1.10 per cent \n● support staff negotiated ATB salary increase of 0 per cent, with an average merit of 1.04 \nper cent (note: support staff ATB salary adjustment to be negotiated if government \nunions negotiate an increase) \n● benefit cost increases of 3.1 per cent (excluding Fund 290) \n● all faculties and administrative units absorb negotiated salary ATB and merit \n● general inflation on contractual obligations of 4.0 per cent \n● impact of carbon levy of $2.2 million ($6 million impact when fully rolled in year three) \n● impact of minimum wage increase in contractual obligations of $1.0 million \n2017-18 budget sensitivities \nRevenue Approximate Value \n● one per cent on Campus Alberta grant: $6.2 million \n● one per cent on credit tuition: $2.7 million \n● 0.25 per cent on short-term interest rate: $1.5 million \nExpense Approximate Value \n● one per cent change in salary settlements (ASSUA and NASA): $6.3 million \n● one per cent increase in benefits: approximately $1.8 million \n● $1/gigajoule increase in natural gas: $2.7 million \n● one per cent operating budget reduction: $7.5 million \nForecast budget assumptions 2018-19 to 2020-21 \nThe university has used the following forecast budget assumptions. \nRevenue assumptions: \n● the grant will increase at 2 per cent per year for each of 2018-2019 to 2020-2021.  [Note: \nthe review of post-secondary funding is currently underway by government]. \n● regulated tuition will increase by the Alberta Consumer Price Index and all other fees will \nincreases by a minimum of the Academic Price Index (approximately 3.3 per cent per \nyear)[Note: the review of the tuition fee regulation is currently underway by government]. \n● all mandatory non-instructional fees will increase by the Academic Price Index \n(approximately 3.3 per cent). \n● modest growth in research funding \n● interest income will remain at historically low levels with some modest recovery with \nendowment returns ranging from 7.0 to 7.25 per cent. \n● stable capital funding \n9 \nCOMPREHENSIVE INSTITUTIONAL PLAN - DRAFT \nExpenditure assumptions: \n● ATB salary adjustments and merit and benefit costs will be subject to collective \nagreement negotiations ( AASUA agreement expires June, 2018 and NASA agreement \nexpires March, 2019).  \n● Benefit cost increases forecast at 6.1 per cent per year predominantly related to pension \ncontributions \n● All faculties and administrative units will continue to have responsibility for the funding of \nsalary ATB adjustments and merit. \n● All other expenditures are forecast to increase in the range of two to ten per cent. \n10 \nCOMPREHENSIVE INSTITUTIONAL PLAN - DRAFT \nTable 1. 2017-18 Consolidated Budget and Projections ($,000) \n11 \nCOMPREHENSIVE INSTITUTIONAL PLAN - DRAFT \nTable 2. 2017-2018 Consolidated Budget By Fund ($,000)  \nInstitutional budget risks  \nThe current environment in which the university’s 2017-2018 budget was prepared is \nunprecedented in terms of the major government policy reviews underway including the post-\nsecondary funding and tuition regulation reviews, the uncertainty around various revenue \ngeneration initiatives currently before government and the provincial government’s fiscal \nsituation. As a result, the university has identified many of its revenue and expenditure drivers at \na high risk level.  The degree of uncertainty associated with core elements of the university’s \nbudget would indicate that a high level of caution should be exercised regarding current and \nlonger term budget assumptions.   \nSpecific factors affecting the university’s budget risks have been grouped in terms of systemic \nas well as specific revenue and expenditure risks for 2017 – 2018. Systemic risks are those \nlargely outside the control of the university. \n12 \nCOMPREHENSIVE INSTITUTIONAL PLAN - DRAFT \nSystemic Risks \nRevenue \n● Campus Alberta Grant. The grant continues to be the university's primary source of \nunrestricted revenue.  The provincial government’s current fiscal situation, along with the \nongoing funding review, place any increase to the grant and the longer-term value of the \ngrant at a high risk.  \n● Tuition revenue. Tuition revenue is a factor of quantity, mix and price. The university \nrequires the ability to adjust enrolment numbers and mix to align with demand as well as \nadjust tuition levels in response to cost increases as well as market demand and \nconditions.  This is particularly true regarding graduate and international student tuition \nfee levels.  As well, if there are constraints on the Campus Alberta grant, the university \nmust have the flexibility to generate tuition revenue to fulfill its academic mission and \nsustain the quality of the learning experience. As the tuition regulation is currently under \nreview by government this revenue source may be at a high risk. \n● Student enrolment quantity and mix Total tuition revenue is driven by tuition levels \nand a complex mix of student type and degree program.  A broad range of external \nenvironmental or geopolitical issues can impact the university’s quantity and mix of \nstudents.  \n● Interest Rates. Interest income is an important source of revenue on the margin. With a \ncontinuation of low oil prices and the sluggish Canadian economy there continues to be \ndownward pressure on the Bank of Canada rate.  Low interest rates continue to impact \nthe ability of university to grow, on the margin, unrestricted revenue. \n● Alternative Revenue. The university must increase its capacity to generate alternative \nsources of revenue to offset constraints to grant funding, tuition revenue limitations, and \nlow investment income returns. However, the government has yet to approve the transfer \nof land to the land trust and several academic initiatives that could generate new sources \nof revenue. \n● Exchange Rates. The Canadian dollar continues to hover around the $0.75 to the US \ndollar. Although a lower Canadian dollar benefits the provincial government in terms of \noil and gas revenue and reduces some international students’ cost of tuition, a declining \nCanadian dollar also increases the university's costs for many of the goods and services \nproduced in the US or purchased in US dollars. \nExpenditures \n● Compensation. The single largest expenditure for the university is employee \ncompensation.  The greatest challenge faced by the university is the fact that total \ncompensation continues to increase at a faster rate than the university’s Campus Alberta \ngrant and tuition, its primary sources of operating funding.  \n● Unfunded Pension Plan Liabilities. The university is carrying a large unfunded liability \nin its pension plans.  The high contribution rates and the overall level of the unfunded \nliability presents significant risk to the university. \n13 \nCOMPREHENSIVE INSTITUTIONAL PLAN - DRAFT \n● Academic Price Index The costs within the university (Academic Price Index) are rising \nat a faster rate than general inflation (Consumer Price Index) and the overall rate of \nincrease in the university’s operating revenues.  The university’s API is also being \nnegatively impacted by the carbon levy as well as the increases to minimum wage. The \noverall rate of increase in the API continues to put significant pressure on ability of the \nuniversity to balance its operating fund. \n● Deferred Maintenance As the largest and oldest post-secondary institution in the \nprovince its deferred maintenance continues to increase reaching $938 million.  This \nlevel of deferred maintenance could result in a significant building system failure \nnegatively impacting the university’s operations.  \n2017 – 2018 Budget Risks \n● Campus Alberta Grant High Given the current fiscal position of the provincial \ngovernment receiving a 2 per cent increase the the grant is considered high risk. \n● NASA Collective Agreement Medium The NASA collective agreement is subject to a \nwage re-opener if the Alberta government and its employees negotiate a general wage \nincrease.  This could result in an increase to the university’s salary expenditures. \n●  Impact of ATB and Merit Medium to High Each Faculty and unit is responsible to fund \ntheir cost of ATB and merit.  Each unit has a different capacity to meet these \ncommitments.  Depending on the unit, this may require a re-alignment of budgets \nincluding position eliminations and staff layoffs.   \n● Salary equity Issues Medium The university is continuing its review of data to assess \nwhether salary equity issues are present within the academic workforce.  If salary equity \nissues are identified they will need to be addressed by the university.  \nCapital and ancillary budgets \nCapital  \nThe university can only achieve its vision if it has access to well-maintained and financially \nsupported facilities.  Through a focus on well-planned functional renewal and re-purposing of \nexisting fiscal assets, essential teaching and research capacity that meets the needs of \ntomorrow’s students, teachers and researchers, can be delivered.  The university’s ability to \nmeet its own and the province’s post-secondary access objectives, focusing on energy and \ncarbon footprint reductions and supporting the move to renewal energy (supporting the Climate \nLeadership Plan), depends on increased and stable investment in deferred maintenance, and \nstrategic investment in the renewal, upgrading and repurposing of older facilities, minimizing the \nneed for new construction. \nTable 3 lists the approved capital projects for 2017-2018. New and continuing capital \nconstruction is budgeted at $128.7 million of the $156.7 million in capital projects. The capital \nbudget also includes $28 million in capital program spending under the infrastructure \nmaintenance and energy management programs. Table 3 also identifies proposed capital \n14 \nCOMPREHENSIVE INSTITUTIONAL PLAN - DRAFT \nprojects which are subject to available funding. Detailed information on the university’s capital \nplan can be found in Appendix F. \nTable 3. 2017-2018 Capital Budget ($,000) \n15 \nCOMPREHENSIVE INSTITUTIONAL PLAN - DRAFT \nAncillaries \nThe university runs several large ancillary operations: Ancillary Services (Residence Services, \nHospitality Services, Parking, Real Estate and Commercial Property Management Services, \nONEcard) the Bookstore, Enterprise Square, the University Health Centre, and Utilities.   \nAll of the university’s ancillaries must generate the required revenues to support their operating \nand ongoing capital requirements as well as maintain both operating and capital reserves. \nAncillary Services \nDespite short-term deficiencies in annual net operations Ancillary Services maintains a \nsubstantial positive reserve balance.  Significant challenges include: Michener Park housing \ncomplex deferred maintenance; increasing residence vacancy rate; increasing costs associated \nwith unionization; increasing minimum wage and the carbon levy; and residence and parking \nrates at or near market rates. These factors will need to be monitored carefully in terms of the \nlong-term impact on our financial position. \nBookstore \nThe bookstore continues to be challenged with e-delivery of course materials and increasing \ncompetition. With a strong focus on cost control the bookstore is returning to a positive net \nposition. \nEnterprise Square \nEnterprise square remains in a positive financial position with all of its space fully occupied. \nUniversity Health Centre \nThe University Health Centre remains in a positive financial position.  The area of greatest \nconcern is the continuation of targeted mental health funding from government  to support the \nprovision of additional mental health support services. \nUtilities \nUtilities net operations remains in a balanced position while providing highly dependable and \ncost effective utilities to North Campus and surrounding entities. The greatest uncertainty is the \nlong-term impact of the government’s carbon levy policies and the need to upgrade its power \ngrid infrastructure to align with enhancements being implemented by EPCOR.   \n16 \nCOMPREHENSIVE INSTITUTIONAL PLAN - DRAFT \nTable 4. 2017-2018 Ancillaries Budget and Projections ($,000)  \n17 \nCOMPREHENSIVE INSTITUTIONAL PLAN - DRAFT \nConclusion \nThe university faces significant budget uncertainty in 2017 – 2018 however is determined to \nmove forward with the implementation of its goals, objective and strategies as outlined in For the \nPublic Good.  As a major economic driver in the province and a critical contributor to the \ndiversification of the Alberta economy, the university looks to the province for stable and \npredictable funding..  Working in partnership with the government, the university is confident that \nit can fulfill its mandate, provide a dynamic and integrated learning and research environment \nand meet the social, cultural and economic needs of this province.  \nStatement of Operations and Cash Flow \nStatement of Operations Budget for the Years ending March 31, 2018 \nto 2021 ($,000)  \nTable 5.

With the completion of our Institutional Strategic \nPlan, For the Public Good, and aligned with the Government’s adult learning system’s \nprinciples of accessibility, affordability, quality, coordination and accountability, the uni-\nversity has refined its focus to address deferred maintenance and functional renewal / \nrepurposing of existing physical assets, as well as reviewing how underused space can \nprovide cost-effective opportunities for consolidation and repurposing to enhance space \nin order to build essential teaching and research capacity. With this key work completed, \ncritical expansions would be required only to meet the needs of tomorrow’s students, \nteachers and researchers, and to maintain the institution’s competitive global position. \nWith five well-established major campuses to support, the U of A has carefully evaluated \nits academic requirements across all areas to ensure that all capital investments form \npart of the long-term vision in support of For the Public Good. These priority investments \nwould capitalize on the utilization of existing, but old and functionally inadequate, infra-\nstructure. Through renovation and repurposing, the university would initially reduce its \ncurrent level of deferred maintenance ($938M) by approximately $100 – 150 million, de-\npending on the level of capital investment available. \nBy reclaiming classroom space for Faculties that are badly space-constrained, our pri-\norities improve program outcomes across a number of key Faculties and, in some in-\nstances, will negate the requirement for a new build. Reclaimed space reduces reliance \non leased space, sets up the conditions for projects to support multiple Faculties, and \nresults in a ‘domino’ effect to support other Faculties on North Campus through the pro-\nvision of purpose-designed and built space and the repurposing and renovation of va-\ncated space in multiple buildings.  Additionally, investment in the Augustana and Cam-\npus Saint-Jean campuses is key to maintaining and developing programming for rural \nliberal arts and sciences as well as the only fully bilingual postsecondary education \ncampus in western Canada. \nDeferred maintenance \nRecent investment in new facilities has created an opportunity, through backfill of vacat-\ned space, to creatively address physical and functional renewal of our buildings. Many \nolder facilities were not designed to accommodate the functional and operational re-\nquirements of current and future faculty and students (Faculty Renewal and Student Ex-\nperience), nor are they currently particularly energy efficient. Combining functional and \nphysical renewal projects through backfill projects provides a best-value model for capi-\nC O M P R E H E N S I V E  I N S T I T U T I O N A L  P L A N  -  D R A F T  \n3 \nD\nR\nA\nFT\n   tal projects, minimizing the need for new buildings while facilitating the needs of tomor-\nrow’s learners and researchers, all at a significantly reduced capital cost. \nObjectives:  \n● Maximize opportunities to identify and proactively address deferred maintenance \nand functional renewal, through joint renewal and repurposing projects for exist-\ning building inventory that would also focus on energy and carbon footprint reduc-\ntions and support the move to renewable energy on an opportunity basis. \n● Ensure stable, long-term funding for deferred maintenance, and work with gov-\nernment to develop funding strategies that could support increased and sustained \nfunding in the order of $25 million to $40 million annually. \n● Continue to maintain and improve the condition and functionality of the universi-\nty’s physical assets, which plays a critical role in our ability to attract, support, and \nretain the best students, faculty, and staff. \n● Reduce the risk of building system failures that could affect life safety or result in \nbuilding closures. \n● Maintain the reliability of the university’s utility plant through focused investment \nin the functional renewal that deals with both deferred maintenance and in-\ncreased efficiency with new technology. \n● Support the academic and research goals of the institution and maximize use and \nlife of existing infrastructure, by ensuring that space is functional for current and \nfuture learning and research. \nPlanning \nIn order for high quality and detailed pre-design and planning services (including func-\ntional programming to lock scope) to be conducted, a multi-year allocation of planning \nfunds is required.  This will allow the university to focus specialist resources in support \nof program and budget accuracy in order to be in position to develop innovative solu-\ntions that maximize the utilization of existing space while minimizing our ecological and \ncarbon footprint, allowing us to implement projects as funding becomes available. \nObjectives: \n● In the short term, seek funding for pre-design services (including the develop-\nment of business cases) related to strategic priorities and major opportunities, or \nmandate both, to provide greater scope and budget certainty and to enable re-\nsponses to new funding in a timely manner.  \n● As greater levels of funding become available, seek a long-term funding envelope \nprogram that would include government contributions through capital and Climate \nLeadership grants as well as partnered contributions from internal sources where \npossible. \n● Provide strong and clear campus planning documents that are rooted in sustain-\nability and leading urban design principles. The plans will seek to provide neces-\nsary direction, ensuring academic program needs of the university are met, with \ncareful consideration to the expressed interests of the surrounding neighbour-\nhoods and communities. \n● Reduce the university’s reliance on expensive, long-term commercial leasing with \nbetter pre-design planning that anticipates the university’s quickly changing \nspace needs. \nC O M P R E H E N S I V E  I N S T I T U T I O N A L  P L A N  -  D R A F T  \n4 \nD\nR\nA\nFT\n   Capital projects, BLIMS and investment priorities  \nThe following strategic capital investment priorities are focused on improved asset utili-\nzation, reducing risk and deferred maintenance, repurposing existing infrastructure and \nreducing reliance on leased space while focusing on academic program outcomes in \nline with For the Public Good.   \nFor each campus, two tables are presented. The first, “Capital Project Priority,” reflects \nprojects that have been previously identified to government as top priorities for funding \nconsideration.

These include four in Lister Hall, and \ntwo in the Central Academic Building.  \nPotential Projects with Carbon Reduction Opportunities in Support of Alberta’s \nClimate Leadership Plan \nThe following projects have been identified as potential contributors to reducing the uni-\nversity’s carbon footprint in support of province-wide initiatives to reduce Alberta’s car-\nbon emissions and contribute to sustainability. \nCameron Library \nCameron Library has a significant building envelope problem with failure of exterior \npaneling supports resulting in panels falling off the building face, presenting both a safe-\nty concern and a direct impact to building operations.  The condition of the exterior en-\nvelope is such that a full replacement is required. \nThe project has been approached as a demonstration project showing that with student \nengagement it is possible to address deferred maintenance renewal of existing buildings \nin a manner that trains the next generation of engineers and designers in the renewal of \naged buildings.   Specific skills that students have brought to the project include; energy \nmodelling, creation of  an intelligent Building Information Model, examination of various \ntypes of building envelope solutions, solutions for embedded green poser and renewed \nmechanical systems with solar thermal storage.  Additionally, the project has a defined \ngoal of 50% reduction in energy for an existing building with incorporation of solar ther-\nmal, photovoltaic, natural light reflectors and a thermal wall.   \nUniversiade Pavilion - Butterdome  \nThe building envelope for the Butterdome is deteriorating with significant rusting out of \nthe exterior panel system.  Reviews of the envelope have determined that the panel sys-\ntem will have to be completely replaced and the rain screen assembly renewed.  A de-\nsign review has been undertaken which incorporates retaining the identity of the building \nwhile supporting the installation of photovoltaic (PV) panels in the new wall system cre-\nating a significant green power source and greenhouse gas reduction for the campus.  \nThe project has been planned to incorporate campus research for PV systems which \nprovides demonstration projects for students on the skills required for a new workforce \nfor new building envelope technologies. The project will have a significant visual impact \nthat can be pointed to as a great example of a building renewal incorporating green en-\nergy. \nGreen Labs Program \nThe University of Alberta's Green Labs program supports our research community in \nbuilding healthy, safe and green teaching and research labs. Labs can use considerable \namounts of water, electricity and consumable materials. This program makes it easier \nfor researchers to maintain environmentally-responsible and healthy laboratory work-\nC O M P R E H E N S I V E  I N S T I T U T I O N A L  P L A N  -  D R A F T  \n9 \nD\nR\nA\nFT\n   spaces and engage in practices that reduce their ecological footprint, improve energy \nefficiency, conserve water and reduce waste. This program influences change through \nnetworking behaviour change programs, and incenting the use of ecologically preferable \nequipment.   \nSouth Campus District Energy System \nThe U of A proposes building a District Energy System (DES), incorporating combined \nheat and power (CHP), to meet the energy requirements of new facilities and to transi-\ntion existing facilities to the DES.  It will have the ability to service government facilities \nin the future as the opportunity becomes available.  DES, including CHP, can make sig-\nnificant contributions to reducing GHG emissions. \nHighlights \nSummary of ongoing major capital projects \n● Research and Collection Resource Facility: $30M (debt financed), turnover \nplanned for Sept 2017.

On budget and \nschedule. \n● SIF: see above \nEnergy Management \nEnergy Management Program  \nGiven the success of the University of Alberta’s energy management program (EMP), \nthe university initiated a new round of energy projects for campus facilities. As in previ-\nous years, the next generation of the EMP is financed through borrowing and paid back \nthrough resulting energy savings. The accumulated impact of ongoing and significant \ninvestment in energy management initiatives has aided in reducing greenhouse gas \nemissions and lowering operating costs, added renewable energy to plant capacity, and \ncontributed significantly in a partnership approach to the reduction of the deferred \nmaintenance liability.   For fiscal 2014/2015 the utility cost avoidance for the measures \nundertaken is estimated at $16,732,112.   Since the inception of the University of Alber-\nta’s energy management program in 1975 the total accumulated cost avoidance is esti-\nmated at $336M. \nSustainability \nC O M P R E H E N S I V E  I N S T I T U T I O N A L  P L A N  -  D R A F T  \n10 \nD\nR\nA\nFT\n   The U of A’s Sustainability Commitment and Guiding Principles articulate our commit-\nment to a continuous effort to instill sustainability into the many aspects of university life, \non our campuses, in our institution, and in the larger community of which we are part. \nThe U of A strives to manage all resources in harmony, recognizing the interconnected-\nness of ecological, social and economic systems.  \nThe U of A’s campus sustainability initiative is facilitated by the Office of Sustainability \nand guided by the goals and strategies outlined in both the Institutional Strategic Plan \nand Sustainability Plan. The university monitors and reports our performance using the \nSustainability Tracking, Assessment & Rating System (STARS™). Developed by the \nAssociation for the Advancement of Sustainability in Higher Education, this tool monitors \nperformance in education and research, operations, planning, planning, administration, \nand engagement. The university attained a STARS™ Gold rating in 2014 (up from a Sil-\nver rating in 2012). The U of A will complete its third STARS™ assessment in 2017.  \nUtilities \nThe District Energy System (DES), serving the U of A’s North Campus and other part-\nners in the Greater Campus Area (GCA), has a number of priorities that address expan-\nsion and reliability issues.  The first is to replace the aging electrical infrastructure in the \nHeating Plant.  Phase two of approximately 8 phases has just been completed.  This \nproject is funded through Utilities reserves.  The second major project is the expansion \nand upgrade of the electrical service from EPCOR’s Garneau substation to the U of A.  \nThis project is in preliminary design and regulatory phase and will require funding, for \nthe GCA portion, from government to proceed. \nOn the U of A’s South Campus, in addition to the DES project identified above, the up-\ngrade of basic infrastructure, including the electrical service, needs to be addressed to \naccommodate further growth on this campus.   \nC O M P R E H E N S I V E  I N S T I T U T I O N A L  P L A N  -  D R A F T  \n11 \nD\nR\nA\nFT\nItem No. 8 \nGFC ACADEMIC PLANNING COMMITTEE \nFor the Meeting of February 15, 2017 \nOUTLINE OF ISSUE \nAdvice, Discussion, Information Item  \nAgenda Title: Terms of Reference TOUR of GFC Standing Committees \nItem   \nProposed by Mark Loewen, Chair, Ad Hoc Committee on Academic Governance \nincluding Delegated Authority \nPresenter Deborah Burshtyn, Mark Loewen, Marina Banister \nDetails \nResponsibility General Faculties Council \nThe Purpose of the item is \n(please be specific) \nMembers of the ad hoc Committee are touring GFC Standing \nCommittees to solicit input, perspectives, and innovative ideas on \nmoving Academic Governance into the future.

This includes making decisions with regard to the structures, policies, and practices of decision-\nmaking, the exercise of authority, and the mechanisms of accountability.   \nUniversity governance is multi-level and bicameral. Provincial legislation – the Post-Secondary Learning \nAct (PSLA) – sets the framework for university governance. At the institutional level, the PSLA prescribes \nthat UAlberta will have bicameral institutions of governance – that is, there are two governing bodies. The \nBoard of Governors (the Board) oversees the business affairs of the institution – from appointing the \nPresident, through to approving budgets, investment strategies, collective agreements, and long-range \nstrategic planning. The General Faculties Council (GFC) oversees ‘academic affairs’. \nTo understand the operations of the university, it is important to note the distinction between ‘governance’ \nand ‘administration’. While the Board and GFC set policies and establish broad directions for the institution, \nthe university’s senior executive team is responsible for administrative operations, including operational \npolicies and decisions. And this is replicated at the Faculty and Departmental levels across the university.  \nGood governance requires collegial practice at all levels including the Board, the executive and all \nmembers of the institution.  \nThis ad hoc committee’s mandate pertains to reviewing academic governance at the institutional level. \nThus, we are to remain focused on the operations of GFC and its standing committees (including the \ndelegation of authority from GFC, the mandate and structure of committees, and related matters). \nBut, as a matter of principle, we embrace a reasonably expansive understanding of ‘academic affairs’ and, \nthus, GFC’s mandate. We support the notion that GFC must have the capacity to defend its legitimate role \nwith regard to issues that exist at the boundary between governance and administration, as well as \nbetween Board and GFC responsibilities. We also support the notion that GFC should have early \nopportunities to influence strategic decisions and directions that are set by the Board or administration, but \nimpinge on academic affairs. \nGuiding Principles \nAs a committee, we are committed to the principles of ‘collegial academic governance’. These principles \ninclude: \n• A desire to build mutual understanding of common goals and shared purpose – operationalized in \nnumerous ways, including the adoption of an institutional strategic plan. \n• A commitment to inclusive and participatory governance decision-making.  \n• A desire to facilitate meaningful individual-level engagement in governance processes. \n• A commitment to openness, transparency, and respectful communication.  \n• A commitment to responsiveness, respect, and reciprocity between governing bodies and between \ngoverning bodies and university administration.  \nAd Hoc Committee on Academic Governance including Delegated Authority \nGuiding Principles \n2 \nFurther Guiding Elements \nGuided by these principles, we begin our deliberations in agreement on the following: \n• GFC must take seriously its responsibility for academic affairs, and commit to showing leadership\non emerging issues and serving as a forum for discussing and taking decisions in the interest of\nacademic freedom, and excellence in research, creativity, and teaching and learning.\n• While the standing Committees of GFC should have real power to make (or initiate) substantive\ndecisions, a commitment to regular and reciprocal communication should position GFC to ensure\nthat its members retain the capacity to bring significant issues to the floor of GFC for debate and\ndecision. Standing Committee chairs have a responsibility to identify issues that Standing\nCommittee members feel are deserving of discussion by full GFC.\n• The composition of GFC Standing Committees should reflect the principle of meaningful\nrepresentation of elected, appointed, and ex officio, and student, staff, and faculty membership.\n• While ensuring appropriate checks and balances are in place, appropriate consultations occur, and\ncompeting interests are always considered, GFC’s committee structure and decision making\nprocesses should be designed to ensure streamlined pathways for the consideration and, when\ndesired, approval of proposals flowing from Faculties and other units within the University.\n• Meetings of GFC must be conducted in a manner that encourages participation and engagement.\n• Members of GFC, whether they are elected, appointed, or ex officio, student, staff, or faculty,\nshould be encouraged to represent the interests of any ‘constituency’ with which they are affiliated,\nwhile also considering competing interests and striving to consider (and define) the broader\ninstitutional interest.\nThis overview of the ad hoc committee’s guiding principles is, in many ways, incomplete, but it reflects our \nstarting point for considering the many issues before us. \nEndorsed by General Faculties Council: \nNovember 21, 2016\n\tFinal-Agenda\n\tItem-4-Termination-ALES-Range&Pasture\n\t4-OI-termination-Range&Pasture-ALES\n\t4-att-1-Termination_RangeandPastureMajor_January_2017\n\tItem-5-Sexual-Violence-Policy-Suite\n\tItem-5-Sexual-Violence-Policy-Suite-OI\n\tItem-5-Sexual-Violence-Suite-ATT1\n\tItem-5-Sexual-Violence-Suite-ATT2-REV\n\tItem-5-Sexual-Violence-Suite-ATT3-REV\n\tItem-5-Sexual-Violence-Suite-ATT4\n\tItem-5-Sexual-Violence-Suite-ATT5\n\tItem-6-Mandatory-Student-Instructional-Fees\n\t6-OI-student-fees\n\t6-att-1-4-student-fees\n\tEAS 237 Field School Fee RACF form (3)\n\t ENGG 490\n\tENGG 490\n\tEDU 211\n\tAttachment 2_Change\n\tCSL 350 and CSL 360\n\tHGP 499 599 Field School Fee RACF form (2)\n\tAttachment 3_Delete\n\tREN R 482\n\tAttachment 4_increase_other_fee\n\tMBA Confirmation Deposit\n\tItem-7-CIP-Budget-Capital\n\tItem-7-CIP-Budget-Capital-OI\n\tItem-7-CIP-Budget-Capital-ATT1\n\tItem-7-CIP-Budget-Capital-ATT2\n\tItem-8-ToR-week\n\t8-OI - ToR Week\n\t8-Att-1-ToR-Academic-Planning-Committee\n\t8-Att-2-Ad Hoc Guiding Principles-endorsed by GFC\n",
