            "Description": "Purpose of the Proposal: For information/discussion. Discussion: Continuing on the discussion regarding the development of the draft Sexual Violence Policy and Procedure, the Chair enquired about the routing of the proposal through GFC and the Board of Governors. In response, the GFC Secretary indicated that the Provost and Vice-President (Academic) had asked this Committee to officially consider this proposal in the governance routing, even in the absence of related changes to the Code of Student Behaviour (COSB). Initially, Ms Eerkes noted a few errors within the documentation, including within the definition of consent, and she stated that this will be amended as appropriate. Members engaged in discussion surrounding this term, and a member enquired whether consent between a supervisor and learner has been fully explored. Members expressed comments regarding other definitions within the draft documents, including disclosure, and it was noted that the issue of complaints or reports about sessional staff members and graduate students, who may be at greater risk and who may not be employed or studying at the University of Alberta, is not addressed in the Policy, Procedure and information documents. On the definition of sexual harassment, Ms Eerkes noted that it already exists with institutional policy, specifically the Discrimination, Harassment and Duty to Accommodate Policy. In addition, a member sought clarification surrounding the definitions of retaliation and harassment. The GFC Secretary, Ms Brolley, indicated that there are changes coming to the definitions within the Discrimination, Harassment and Duty to Accommodate Policy which would require review to ensure alignment. The Chair explained that the definition of distribution of intimate images remains problematic and that there is great potential for misinterpretation. The Chair suggested that the definition could be revised to prevent this. In response, Dr Costopoulos noted that the underlying issue is whether something is or is not a sexual act but agreed that the wording should point to the sexual act. The Chair explained that this is difficult to do without proof of intent to harm or harass, and that this is the problematic element within the design of the definition and that further, courts have been skeptical of attempts to constrict freedom of expression. Members discussed whether the definition of voyeurism would be more appropriate in this context and whether the two definitions could be combined to strengthen the language. Members also discussed the relevant differences between the definitions, such as between employees, or between staff and students, etc., and that it is the relationship that changes the applicability of the definitions. A member noted that the relationships between students is a critical piece. The Chair commented on prohibiting distribution of one's own body without prior consent is too broad, and Dr Costopoulos agreed to review this matter further. A member sought clarification in regards to concurrent criminal, civil and university processes of investigations. On this, Dr Costopoulos noted that the different processes are frequently utilized, and that all jurisdictions are separate. Members continued to discuss interim measures and accommodation during these concurrent processes. Members engaged in a lengthy discussion in relation to prior consent and the remaining threat of discipline or punishment, and the Chair reiterated that these definitions may violate the Charter in their current form. A member enquired about whether this Policy will be reviewed within a few years, as is the case with other Policies, and Dr Costopoulos confirmed that it would be reviewed. The Chair thanked presenters and members for their commentary.",

She clarified that an increase in charges of violation of safety and dignity are due to an increase of reporting. In addition, she reported an increased rate of academic misconduct from international students and members discussed whether these were primarily undergraduate or graduate students. In regards to plagiarism cases, Ms Eerkes clarified that only the most severe cases are directed towards her office and that most are handled at the Faculty level. Member discussed the differences between expulsion and suspension. Ms Eerkes reported a drop in cases related to alcohol and drugs.

Discussion: Mr Peterson provided members with a description of his role as the Appeals and Compliance Officer and the three university appeal bodies – the University Appeal Board (UAB), the GFC Academic Appeals Committee (GFC AAC) and the GFC Practicum Review Board (GFC PRB). He explained that these bodies represent the final level of university appeal, subject to judicial review. Mr Peterson noted that members of appeal panels are volunteer students and staff, and that they are trained in following fair process. On this point, he acknowledged the hard work of these volunteers in carrying out their roles. In regards to the contents of the Report, he pointed out a levelling off of academic offences, and in terms of appeal numbers, he reported a decrease. He stated that this may be due to a lag in decisions from late spring which resulted in appeals outside of the reporting period. Mr Peterson reported that non-academic offences, although increasing, still make up a small number of appeals, but they do require additional resources to address. Mr Peterson provided members with a brief summary of the appeals decisions. He pointed out that the disposition statistics are only a snapshot of the year’s cases, each decided on its own unique merits, and not necessarily showing any trend. A member asked whether, in the face of new evidence, the appeal can be forwarded back to the Faculty. Mr Peterson explained that the AAC Policy provides for this process. The Chair thanked Mr Peterson for his thorough Report.",

For the continued evolution \nand operation of the University of Alberta \nMuseums research collection facilities, \npurpose-built spaces are still required and the \nPolicy and Planning Committee and Curators \ncontinued to discuss this need.\nThe following facility updates and issues for \nthe University of Alberta Museums collec-\ntions were reported during this period: \n • Human Ecology’s Clothing and Textile \nCollection is looking into installing a new \nsecurity system with cameras to address the \nthreat of vandalism and theft.\n • Negotiations continue in order to move the \nLaboratory for Vertebrate Paleontology \ncollection (approximately 50,000 specimens) \nto the Centennial Centre for Interdisciplinary \nScience (CCIS) to improve storage conditions.\n • The Parasite Collection’s dry slide collection \n(21,000 specimens) was relocated from \nthe fourth floor of the Biological Sciences \nbuilding to the seventh floor. \n • The Vascular Plant Herbarium converted an \nadjacent room into a preparatory space to \nallow for safer integration of new material \ninto the collection. This new prep room will \nallow for proper inspection and drying of \nspecimens prior to them entering the main \nstorage area, which will better protect the \nexisting collection from potential infestation. \n • The type specimens from the Paleobotanical \nCollection were relocated from the sub-\nbasement of the Zoology Wing in the \nBiological Sciences to the fourth floor of \nthe Botany Wing and underwent a complete \ninventory and digitization during this \nprocess. Additionally, the acetate peels in the \nPaleobotanical Collection were successfully \nrelocated to the fourth floor of the Botany \nWing into a much more suitable environment \nthat will aid in their long-term preservation.\n • The University of Alberta Museum of \nZoology’s Mammalogy Collection underwent \na major storage reorganization and \nimprovement project in the summer of 2015. \nThe collection was collated and reorganized \nonto the eleventh floor of the Biological \nSciences building. A complete inventory of \nthe collection is ongoing as a direct result of \nthis project.\n • The Pathology Gross Teaching Collection \nunderwent storage upgrades to protect wet \nspecimens in the Pathology Museum from \ndamage.

However, the motion requesting new \nfunds of $350,000 per year was withdrawn \nby City Councillors and therefore not \ndeliberated by City Council during the budget \nmeetings, thus ending the collaboration \neffective March 31, 2016. \nThe Policy and Planning Committee and \nCurators discussed this initiative. The \nmajority along with the University of Alberta \nMuseums remain committed to this space \nfor these reasons:\n • The University of Alberta Museums require \nspace to present the diverse and extensive \nmuseum collections and their associated \nknowledge to a broad public audience;\n • With the University of Alberta focus on \ncommunity engagement, this venue provides \na location through which the University of \nAlberta can involve diverse communities of \nnot only the collections on campus, but the \nUniversity as a whole;\n • To remain accredited and be eligible for \nmuseum grants, the University of Alberta \nMuseums and the associated collections \nrequire space to provide access to the \nAlberta public and beyond;\n • The gallery space at Enterprise Square \nmeets environmental requirements such \nas temperature, humidity, and security \nfor exhibiting collections that are museum \nquality and certified as cultural property.\nHowever, the Policy and Planning Committee, \nCurators, and University of Alberta Museums \nalso recognize the following issues: there \nis currently no long-term commitment for \nthe space and no commitment to funding in \norder to operate the space. The combination \nof these two factors makes it difficult to \ndevelop a long-term plan, create efficiencies, \nbuild community partnerships, and seek out \nexternal funding opportunities. \nA funding request for $350,000 has been \ngranted by the Office of the Provost for  \nthe 2016/17 year to continue operations and \nprogramming for the University of Alberta \nMuseums Galleries at Enterprise Square on  \na one-year basis.\n Left to Right: Lyndal Osborne, \nLiz Ingram, Walter Jule\n11 university of alberta museums: july 1, 2015 — sep. 30, 2016 annual report\nInternship Programs \nThe Committee adjudicated applications to the \nFriends of the University of Alberta Museums \nInternship in Museum Innovation again in both \n2015 and 2016.

Student Conduct and Accountability Statistical Report 2015/16 Academic year (pages 1 - 8) \nPrepared by: Deborah Eerkes, Director, SCA, deerkes@ualberta.ca \nSTATISTICAL REPORT\n2015/16   ACADEMIC YEAR\nwww.ualberta.ca/studentconduct     \nSTUDENT CONDUCT AND \nACCOUNTABILITY (SCA)\nMANDATE\nStudent Conduct and Accountability (SCA) is mandated \nto deal with issues around the Code of Student Behaviour. \nApproaching the Code in terms of awareness, prevention \nand student discipline, SCA strives to ensure that students \nunderstand the expectations placed upon them by the Code \nand are able to participate freely and fully in the university \ncommunity.\nWhen students are alleged to have engaged in behaviour \nthat violates the Code of Student Behaviour, one of the two \nDiscipline Officers in SCA is assigned to make a decision \naccording to the procedures set out in the Code.  Faculty \nDeans (or designate) make recommendations for severe \nsanctions in academic misconduct cases, while University \nof Alberta Protective Services (UAPS) or Unit Directors \nThe two Discipline Officers completed a total of 61 decisions \nin the 2015/16 academic year. In order to align the numbers \nwith those collected by the Appeals and Compliance Officer, \nthe decisions counted in this report include those in which the \nappeal deadline falls between July 1, 2015, and June 30, 2016. \nThe matters before the Discipline Officers are complex, often \ninvolving legal or procedural considerations. Investigations take \non average 23.5 hours to complete, although the time required \nranged from 7 hours for the simplest decision to 177 hours for \nthe most complex. The majority of the cases fell within the 15-\n30 hour range. \nMost academic violations are handled solely at the Faculty level \nwith Intermediate Sanctions under the Code. Appropriately, \nonly the most egregious cases are referred to SCA with \nrecommendations for Severe Sanctions. These cases tend to \nbe more complex in nature and often involve prior offences. \nBecause the statistics cited herein apply strictly to Student \nConduct and Accountability, any trends identified in terms of \nacademic misconduct must not be generalized to the entire \nUniversity. For a total number of academic offences that did not \ninvolve a referral to the Discipline Officer, please refer to the \nAppeals Coordinator’s report from University Governance.\nmake recommendations for charges and sanctions in non-\nacademic misconduct cases. The Discipline Officer meets \nwith the student alleged to have committed the misconduct, \ninvestigates the complaint if the facts are in dispute, and makes \na finding on whether the student violated the Code. If the \nstudent is found responsible, the Discipline Officer decides \nwhat sanctions are warranted, using the recommendation from \nthe complainant as a starting point.\nThroughout the 2015/16 academic year, Deborah Eerkes and \nChris Hackett were the two Discipline Officers under the Code \nof Student Behaviour.\nUAPS investigates allegations of non-academic misconduct, \nand of those that fall under the Code of Student Behaviour, \nsends recommendations for charges and sanctions to the \nDiscipline Officer. In addition, Unit Directors can recommend \ncharges and sanctions to the Discipline Officer for allegations \nof Inappropriate Use of University Property and Resources \nrelating to their own units. \nFinally, the Discipline Officers are responsible to make decisions \nin two kinds of appeals: \n1. Students can appeal a UAPS Violation Notice to the \nDiscipline Officer when they are disputing the facts. The \nDiscipline Officer can uphold or deny the appeal, or vary \nthe fine on the Violation Notice. \n2. The second type of appeal relates to complaints made to \nUAPS in which the Director decides not to recommend \ncharges under the Code. The complainant can appeal to \nthe Discipline Officer, who makes a decision on whether \nit was reasonable not to lay charges under the Code, or \nwhether an investigation should proceed. In the latter case, \nthe Discipline Officer will initiate an investigation, make a \nfinding and render a decision. This is a change to procedure \nin the Code of Student Behaviour that took effect in \nSeptember 2015, and significantly simplifies the process.\nDISCIPLINE CASES\n2\nThe 61 case files for the 2015/16 academic year showed an \noverall increase of 38% over the previous year. Three of those \ncases were student appeals, and did not involve charges against \nstudents.

Some statistics for previous years are also included \nfor comparison. \nThis report sets out information about discipline decisions and the appeal process under the Code of Student \nBehaviour (COSB) and the Code of Applicant Behaviour (COAB), with a focus on the university appeal level of the \nUniversity Appeal Board (UAB). This report also sets out information for the two other university level appeal \nbodies, the General Faculties Council Academic Appeals Committee (GFC AAC) and the General Faculties Council \nPractice Review Board (GFC PRB). \nRole of the Appeals Coordinator \nAs Appeals and Compliance Officer, I carry out the role of the Appeals Coordinator under the COSB, COAB, \nUniversity of Alberta Academic Appeals Policy and University of Alberta Practicum Intervention Policy for the \nUAB, GFC AAC and GFC PRB. In this role I am neutral and do not advocate for either party in an appeal. I \nfacilitate or administer the appeal process steps from the time an appeal is received, through the hearing and decision \nmade by an appeal panel, to distribution of the written decision. I also provide procedural information to the parties \nto an appeal and to the appeal panel throughout the appeal process. \nApart from individual appeals, I oversee the university level appeal system to ensure that the university continues to \nimplement a fair process by which to address appeals. This includes helping to educate panel members as to the \nframework within which they work when hearing appeals and attempting to help the university community \nunderstand that framework. This report is intended to aid in that understanding. \nUniversity Level Appeal Process \nThe university level appeal system is made up of three main appeal bodies – the UAB, the GFC AAC and the GFC \nPRB.  \nDiscipline decisions arise as a result of a student being charged with an offence (academic and/or non-academic) \nunder the COSB or COAB. When the appropriate decision-maker has made a final decision finding an offence and \nimposing a sanction, the parties to that decision have a final appeal to the UAB. \nPage 2 of 4  \nAttachment 1.0 \nThe UAB generally hears appeals from students charged under the COSB or COAB who disagree with the discipline \ndecisions. UAB decisions are final and binding, within the university, subject to judicial review. Under the COSB \nthe UAB has the broad authority to determine whether an offence was committed and to confirm, vary or quash \nsanctions imposed. \nUnder the Academic Appeal Policy, academic standing issues are heard by the GFC AAC. The GFC AAC hears \nappeals from students wishing to appeal faculty decisions on matters of academic standing, including matters such \nas a requirement to withdraw, denial of graduation or promotion. The GFC AAC hears appeals from students after \nthey have exhausted all other avenues of appeal within a faculty. GFC AAC decisions are final and binding, within \nthe university, subject to judicial review. The authority of the GFC AAC is to uphold (and award any remedy not \ncontrary to faculty rules) or deny an appeal depending upon whether a miscarriage of justice, as defined by the \nAcademic Appeals Policy, occurred within the faculty process.  \nUnder the Practicum Intervention Policy, appeals concerning practicum interventions are heard by the GFC PRB. \nThe GFC PRB’s decisions are final and binding, within the university, subject to judicial review. \nA fourth body, the Three Person Panel under section 30.5.2(8) of the COSB, also existed to address appeals of \ndecisions to not proceed with complaints. The COSB was revised on October 1, 2015 to eliminate the Three Person \nPanel and set up a new system of appeal for such decisions. The Three Person Panel heard no appeals during the \nperiod of this report. \nPrinciples of the Appeal Process  \nAppeals at the university level deal with complex issues affecting students, faculties and the university as a whole. \nGiven this impact, and the fact that this final level of appeal is the last opportunity for issues to be heard within the \nuniversity, it is very important that the appeal process is fair and perceived to be fair. Coming to decisions through a \nfair process also promotes confidence in those decisions by the parties and the appeal panels themselves. Being the \nfinal level of appeal, the decisions or process may also be subject to judicial scrutiny. \nThe authority of the appeal bodies (UAB/GFC AAC/GFC PRB) flows from the powers delegated under the Post-\nSecondary Learning Act. The appeal bodies carry out their authority as outlined in the applicable university appeal \npolicy, in keeping with the principles of administrative fairness. The principles of administrative fairness are the \nbasis for our appeals policies, help us to interpret those policies and provide the framework within which our appeal \npanels make decisions.    \nThe formal steps of our appeals process recognize the impact and finality of these decisions and ensure the \nopportunity for parties to an appeal to make their best cases and be heard. Our appeals process is not a court process, \nbut has been designed to allow for students and university decision-makers to be able to be heard by an objective \npanel coming from the university community. The system is flexible in that it is able to deal with a wide variety of \nappeals and circumstances (from students and university staff representing themselves or being helped by an advisor \nof their choosing) through consistently applying basic principles of administrative fairness. At its core, our appeals  \nPage 3 of 4  \nAttachment 1.0 \nsystem involves the parties fully making their cases in writing and knowing the case of the other side before an \nappeal hearing, then appearing at a hearing where they are able to present and question their arguments and \ninformation before an objective appeal panel. (The UAB process also allows for the option of a paper-only or \ndocumentary review hearing, rather than an in-person hearing, when only the severity of sanction, and not the \noffence, is being appealed.) The appeal panel then considers and weighs all of the submissions of the parties and \ncomes to a decision, which it fully explains to the parties in writing. \nCurrent Trends \nLooking at the attached statistics, after a significant increase over the past recent years in the number of appeals to \nthe university level appeal bodies, this year saw a decrease in the number of appeals. (The current year-to-date \nsuggests we may again see an increase in the next reporting period.) Compared to the previous year, 2015-2016 saw \na similar number of overall decisions made by Deans, with the majority of those decisions concerning the academic \noffences of plagiarism and cheating. Although not statistically tracked, a significant number of appeals are received \nfrom international students.   \n2015-2016 also saw an increase in the number, complexity and time spent addressing issues (including dealing with \nparties' legal counsel) of appeals to the UAB of non-academic offences under the COSB.  \nAppeal panels have continued to address complex issues during the appeal process. This includes procedural \nrequests and issues raised by the parties to appeals both before and during hearings. When such issues are raised, the \nappeal panel chair (and sometimes the full appeal panel) must decide how to address the issue, consider the \narguments and circumstances, and then come to a decision to fairly address the issue. The chair (and sometimes full \npanel) does this through consultation with the Appeals Coordinator, obtaining legal advice when necessary. Again, \nall such decisions are made consistently with the relevant appeals policy and principles of administrative fairness, \nwith the aim of providing both parties a fair opportunity to be heard. Appeals involving legal counsel representing \none or both parties are often of a complex nature, and often take more time throughout the process. Depending on \nthe number and type of procedural issues raised or requests made by the parties during an appeal, the timeframe for \ncompletion of appeals varies. The majority of appeals are completed within one to two months, from the time the \nappeal is received to an appeal decision being made. \nI have continued to promote an understanding of the steps within the appeal process, and the principles upon which \nthey are based, by being available as a resource for parties and panels throughout the course of individual appeals, as \nwell as by meeting with a variety of student and staff groups within our university community.   \nAppeal Panel Membership \nAll of the university level appeal panels are made up of volunteers. While the exact makeup of a panel depends on \nthe applicable appeal policy, generally the panels are a combination of undergraduate/graduate students and \nacademic staff selected from the university’s appeal panel membership lists. (Membership is determined by an \napplication process and ultimately by approval of applicants by GFC.) Members serve on approximately six appeal  \nPage 4 of 4  \nAttachment 1.0 \npanels within a calendar year, but this number varies depending on the number of appeals received and the faculties \ninvolved. Appeal panel members come from the greatest variety of faculties possible. For objectivity, no appeal \npanel member may sit on an appeal involving a party from their faculty. Appeal hearings are scheduled throughout \nthe academic year, including summer, mostly in evenings around academic schedules. Student panel members \nusually serve for two year terms, while academic staff panel members usually serve for three year terms (with the \npossibility of serving additional terms).  \nIn addition to their understanding of the university environment from their experience as students (both \nundergraduate and graduate) and academic staff, our panel members are provided ongoing training in understanding \nthe principles of administrative fairness within which their tribunals operate. This helps to ensure that, as discussed \nabove, the appeal process is a fair one, with both parties to an appeal being given the opportunity to fully make their \ncases to an objective decision-maker.    \nThe service of appeal panel members is a significant commitment, including considering and addressing procedural \nissues arising before and during hearings, conducting hearings, deliberating and drafting written reasons for \ndecisions. All of our panel members recognize the need to objectively hear submissions from parties to an appeal, \nanalyze and weigh evidence, then come to reasonable decisions based on that evidence. I try to ensure that appeal \npanels have all the needed resources to perform this role. I thank all of the appeal panel members for serving our \nuniversity community, often addressing difficult issues involving student careers, faculty standards and the integrity \nand values of the university. Our appeal panels uphold the values of fair decision-making, of a fair appeal process \nand of the university as a whole, for both students and faculty. \nMichael Peterson \nAppeals and Compliance Officer \nUniversity Governance, University of Alberta  \nNovember 16, 2016 \nAttachments: Statistics for Discipline Decisions and the University Level Appeal Process \n[Statistics based upon year of appeal deadline.]   \nAttachment 2.0 \nINDEX OF ATTACHMENTS \nNumber of Appeals Received  Attachment 2.1 \nFigure 1 ...................................................................................................................................................

Overview \na.  Sexual violence is a complex and serious problem in society and on university campuses. Sexual \nviolence can affect individuals of all gender identities, gender expressions, and sexual orientations, as \nwell as those from all ages, abilities, racial, cultural and economic backgrounds. \nb. The University recognizes the harm caused by a culture in which common attitudes, norms and practices \ntolerate, normalize, trivialize, excuse or outright condone sexual violence. Sometimes called rape culture, \nit is perpetuated through images, television, music, jokes, advertising, jargon, words and figures of \nspeech that normalize sexual coercion and shift blame onto those who have experienced sexual violence. \nAs an institution that exists in the context of that culture, the University takes seriously its responsibility to \nreduce sexual violence by fostering a culture of consent and support through education, training and \npolicy. \nc. This policy is guided by the following principles: \ni. the need for safety in the work, study and student residence environment, providing a community \nin which sexual violence is not tolerated, \nii. the inherent dignity of all members of the University community, \niii. the importance of fostering a culture of consent and support through education, training and \npolicy initiatives, \niv. the need to identify and dismantle barriers to making a disclosure and/or complaint,  \nv. access to support for anyone in the University community who discloses that they have \nexperienced or been affected by sexual violence, and \nvi. procedural fairness and support for the parties to formal complaint processes related to sexual \nviolence. \n2. Purpose \nThe purpose of this policy is to state the University’s commitment to addressing sexual violence through \neducation and awareness, providing access to comprehensive support for those who have experienced or \nbeen affected by sexual violence and implementing transparent and fair processes to resolve and adjudicate \ncomplaints of sexual violence. \n  U of A Policies and Procedures On-Line (UAPPOL) \n3. POLICY \na.  It is the policy of the University of Alberta that sexual violence committed by any member of the University \ncommunity is prohibited and constitutes misconduct. Prohibited conduct includes: sexual violence, sexual \nassault, sexual harassment, stalking, indecent exposure, voyeurism, and distribution of intimate \nimages.  \nb. Any member of the University community who discloses having experienced sexual violence will have \naccess to support, whether or not the sexual violence took place on University property or in relation to \nUniversity activities. Where the University has jurisdiction, complaints will be addressed under the \napplicable policies or procedures, including, for example, the Code of Student Behaviour, the \nPostdoctoral Fellow Policy, NASA, AASUA or GSA collective agreements, or other applicable \nemployment contracts and agreements. \n4. COMMITMENT TO THOSE WHO HAVE EXPERIENCED SEXUAL VIOLENCE \na. Sexual violence can have serious and enduring negative effects on physical, mental, emotional and \nspiritual health and wellness. The University recognizes the possible effects of trauma on those who have \nexperienced sexual violence and supports the efforts of individuals to seek support and recover. \nRegardless of where or when it took place, any person who discloses and/or makes a complaint of sexual \nviolence can expect to be: \ni. treated with respect, dignity and compassion, \nii. informed about on- and off-campus resources and supports, \niii. provided with access to support which is non-judgmental, coordinated and comprehensive  \niv. offered options for academic, recreational, University residence and/or workplace modifications \nto prevent further unwanted contact with the subject of the disclosure and ameliorate, to the \nextent possible, the negative impacts of the sexual violence on the person’s working, study or \nstudent residence environment, \nv. provided with information about available complaint processes should they wish to pursue a \ncomplaint within the University and/or to an external law enforcement agency, and  \nvi. offered safety planning assistance. \nb. Subject to the limitations set out in section 6 of this policy, those who experience sexual violence will be \nconsidered the primary decision-maker in matters pertaining to themselves. As such, can determine \nwhether, to whom and what to disclose, and whether to make a complaint within the University and/or an \nexternal law enforcement agency. \n5. RESPONSIBILITIES \na. The University recognizes its institutional responsibility to: \ni. provide an effective policy and procedures to address and prevent sexual violence, \nii. raise awareness about the policy and procedures and relevant support services on campus \nthrough institution-wide education, \niii. raise awareness of consent, sexual violence, prevention, and appropriate responses to \ndisclosures of sexual violence through institution-wide education, \niv. balance the duty to ensure procedural fairness for any person accused of sexual violence with \nsupport and fairness for the complainant within the University’s complaint processes,  \nv. maintaining safe, confidential and neutral mechanisms for individuals to disclose or make a \ncomplaint of sexual violence, \nvi. ensuring the safety of the working, learning and student residence environment by various \nmeans, including the imposition of interim measures, where appropriate, \nvii. provide coordinated and comprehensive supports for those who disclose sexual violence, and \nviii. ensure that all individuals investigating or adjudicating complaints of sexual violence in any \nUniversity complaints process have appropriate training. \nb. All senior leaders, including the President, Vice-Presidents, Deans, Directors and Chairs and other \nofficers of the University exercise administrative responsibility to implement this policy and the related \nprocedures within their respective areas of responsibility, including by creating, supporting and \n  U of A Policies and Procedures On-Line (UAPPOL) \nmaintaining a work, study and student residence environment that promotes a culture of consent, free \nfrom sexual violence. \nc. All members of the University community are responsible for promoting respect and dignity for each other \nby encouraging a culture of consent; and for contributing to work, study and student residence \nenvironments in which individuals can disclose experiences of sexual violence without fear of disbelief, \ndisrespect or reprisal. \n6. PRIVACY AND CONFIDENTIALITY \na. Privacy and confidentiality are essential for creating an environment where those who have experienced \nsexual violence feel safe in disclosing their experience and seeking support. The privacy and confidentiality of \nthose involved in a disclosure of sexual violence will be protected. However, it is important to note that there \nmay be limits to the University’s ability to do so, when: \ni. there is a likely risk of harm to self or others, or \nii. reporting or action is required or authorized by law. \nb. Whether or not the University can maintain the privacy and confidentiality of a disclosure will be determined \non a case by case basis, in consultation with relevant University officials. \nc. In relation to complaints, all University disciplinary processes are confidential. In any complaint process, \nsufficient information must and will be disclosed to the accused in order to meet the requirements of \nprocedural fairness.  \nd. Whether in the context of a disclosure or a complaint, all parties will be informed of the limits of privacy and \nconfidentiality. In cases where confidentiality cannot be maintained, those affected will be informed and \nsupported throughout the process. In such cases, only necessary information will be disclosed, and only to \nthose with a need to know.  \n7. STATEMENT AGAINST RETALIATION \nRetaliation against any person involved in a disclosure or complaint of sexual violence is prohibited. Where it \nhas jurisdiction, the University will investigate all reports of retaliation in accordance with the appropriate \ncomplaints processes. \n8. BAD FAITH COMPLAINTS \nThe University recognizes the serious nature of complaints made under this policy, and may take disciplinary \naction where allegations of sexual violence are shown to be malicious, fraudulent, and/or vexatious. A \ncomplaint made in good faith is not a violation of this policy even if it is not proven in a complaint process. \nDEFINITIONS \nAny definitions listed in the following table apply to this document only with no implied or intended \ninstitution-wide use. [▲Top] \nUniversity community Includes all academic staff and colleagues, administrators and \nsupport staff as outlined and defined in Recruitment Policy \n(Appendix A and Appendix B) as well as third party contractors, \nvisiting speakers, volunteers, professors emeriti, undergraduate \nstudents, graduate students, postdoctoral fellows and visitors to \ncampus. \nSexual violence Any sexual act or act of a sexual nature, or act targeting sexuality, \nwhether physical or psychological, committed without consent. This \nincludes, but is not limited to sexual assault, sexual harassment, \n  U of A Policies and Procedures On-Line (UAPPOL) \nstalking, indecent exposure, voyeurism, distribution of intimate images, \ninducing intoxication, impairment or incapacity for the purpose of \nmaking another person vulnerable to non-consensual sexual activity, \nand other analogous conduct. \nConsent Consent is a voluntary, ongoing, active and conscious agreement to \nengage in the sexual activity in question. Consent or a “yes” that is \nobtained through pressure, coercion, force, threats or by inducing \nintoxication, impairment or incapacity is not voluntary consent. Silence \nor ambiguity do not constitute consent. \nAdditionally, there is no consent when: \n it is given by someone else. \n the person is unconscious, sleeping, highly intoxicated or high, \nor otherwise lacks the capacity to consent. \n it was obtained through the abuse of a position of power, trust \nor authority. \n the person does not indicate “yes”, says “no” or implies “no” \nthrough words or behaviours. \n the person changes their mind and withdraws their consent. \nConsent cannot be implied (for example, by a current or past \nrelationship, by consent to another activity, or by failure to say “no” or \nresist). In addition, consent cannot be given in advance of sexual \nactivity that is expected to occur at a later time. It is the responsibility of \nthe person wanting to engage in sexual activity to obtain clear consent \nfrom the other and to recognize that consent can be withdrawn at any \ntime. \nDisclose/Disclosure A verbal or written report or account by any person to a member of the \nUniversity community that they have experienced sexual violence. \nComplaint Usually a written report or statement alleging sexual violence \nmisconduct made to a University official under a University process for \nthe purpose of initiating an investigation and resolution process. \nSexual assault Any form of sexual contact without consent. This can include unwanted \nor forced kissing, fondling, vaginal or anal penetration or touching, or \noral sexual contact. \nSexual harassment \n(see also Discrimination, \nHarassment and Duty to \nAccommodate Policy) \nConduct or comment of a sexual nature, which detrimentally affects the \nwork, study or living environment or otherwise leads to adverse \nconsequences for the target of the sexual harassment. It can be either \none-time or repeated and:  \na) is demeaning, intimidating, threatening, or abusive; and  \nb) is not trivial or fleeting in nature; and  \nc) causes offence and should have reasonably been expected to \noffend; and  \nd) serves no legitimate purpose for the work, study or living \nenvironment, and  \ne) undermines authority or respect in the work, study or living \nenvironment, or impairs work or learning performance, or limits \nopportunities for advancement or the pursuit of education or research, \nor creates an intimidating, hostile or offensive work or learning \nenvironment.  \nIt may consist of unwanted sexual attention, sexually oriented remarks \n  U of A Policies and Procedures On-Line (UAPPOL) \nor behaviours, or the creation of a negative psychological and \nemotional environment based on gender, gender identity or sexual \norientation. It may be an isolated act or repetitive conduct, but cannot \nbe trifling. A reprisal or threat of reprisal against an individual for \nrejecting a sexual solicitation or advance may also constitute sexual \nharassment.  \nThe person(s) engaged in harassment need not have the intention to \nharass; it is the objective assessment of the circumstances that \nmatters. How would a reasonable observer perceive the situation. A \ncomplainant need not expressly object to unwelcome conduct or \ncomments, although any clear indication that the behaviour is \nunwanted will satisfy the test. A complainant's apparent passivity or \nfailure to object overtly to sexual advances does not necessarily signal \nconsent or welcomed behaviour, especially where a power imbalance \nexists between the individuals. \nStalking Repeated unwanted contact or communication directed at another \nperson that causes reasonable fear or concern for that person’s safety \nor the safety of others known to them.

OVERVIEW \na. The University recognizes the difference between a disclosure and a complaint, and is committed to \nresponding to and reducing sexual violence and attending to its effects by providing  \n supports and resources to persons who have experienced sexual violence and to any other member of \nthe University community who has been affected by sexual violence,  \n interim measures to ensure the safety of the University’s learning, working and residence environment, \n processes to fairly adjudicate formal complaints of sexual violence, and \n education and training to the University community about sexual violence and, in particular, to those \ninvestigating and adjudicating complaints of sexual violence.  \nb. The University will consult with University of Alberta Protective Services (UAPS), legal, medical, and/or \npsychological experts and others as appropriate in determining how to act on disclosures or complaints of \nsexual violence. \n2. PURPOSE \nThe purpose of this procedure is to \n provide guidance to members of the University community on receiving and responding to disclosures of \nsexual violence, \n outline supports, modifications and protections the University may be able to offer to persons who have \nexperienced sexual violence,  \n provide authority for the imposition of interim measures to ensure the safety of the working, learning and \nUniversity residence environment,  \n describe the procedures through which complaints of sexual violence will be addressed and, where \nwarranted, discipline imposed, and  \n address education and training in, and awareness of, sexual violence for the University community \ngenerally and, in particular, for those investigating and adjudicating complaints of sexual violence.  \nPROCEDURE \nThe University’s response to a disclosure will, to the extent possible, be guided by the wishes of the person who \nexperienced the sexual violence. In this regard, in response to a disclosure, the person who experienced sexual \n  U of A Policies and Procedures On-Line (UAPPOL) \nviolence can ask the University to provide supports and resources, facilitate academic, residential, recreation \nand/or work modifications, consider the imposition of interim measures, and initiate an investigation of a complaint \nin accordance with the procedures in applicable agreements or policies. \n3. INTERIM MEASURES \na. Interim measures are non-disciplinary conditions that may be imposed on a person alleged to have committed \nsexual violence. The University may impose interim measures in response to either a disclosure or a \ncomplaint where the allegations would \ni. if proven, constitute sexual violence, and \nii. with regard to all of the circumstances, be a risk to an individual, the community or the integrity of any \npotential investigation. \nb. The purpose of such interim measures is to ensure personal safety, discourage or prevent retaliation, \nprevent further sexual violence, protect confidentiality, avoid the appearance of bias or presumption of guilt, \nminimize disruption to the learning, working or University Residence environment and/or preserve the \nUniversity’s ability to conduct a thorough investigation. \nc. Having regard to all of the circumstances, where interim measures are imposed, they must be, appropriate \nand proportionate to the seriousness of the alleged conduct, and as minimally restrictive as possible to \nachieve their purposes. As a result, interim measures will be based on considerations including, but not \nlimited to: \ni. the reasonable wishes of the person who experienced the sexual violence,  \nii. the nature and/or severity of the alleged conduct, \niii. reasonably credible information about patterns of conduct or previous history of sexual violence or other \nmisconduct, \niv. the potential impact of the measures on the person(s), including on their academic program and/or \nemployment,  \nv. the potential impact of the measures on the learning, working or University Residence environment, \nvi. in the case of employees, in accordance with their relevant collective agreement, and \nvii. any other relevant information.  \nExamples of interim measures can be found in the University’s Interim Measures Information Document. \nd. The decision to impose interim measures will be made by: \ni. in the case of students, the Vice-Provost and Dean of Students, or designate. \nii. in the case of faculty and staff, the Provost and Vice-President (Academic) and/or the Associate Vice-\nPresident (Human Resources), or designate. \niii. in the case of postdoctoral fellows, the Vice-President (Research) , or designate. \nDecision makers may consult as needed in determining whether to impose interim measures and the nature \nof those measures.  \ne. In all cases, decisions on interim measures must be provided in writing and include: \ni. particulars of the measure(s), \nii. information about the right to request a reconsideration, \niii. information about relevant complaint processes, if applicable, and \niv. referrals to supports and/or services. \nf. The person(s) on whom interim measures are imposed may request a reconsideration from the decision \nmaker after sixty (60) days or such earlier time as agreed to by the decision maker. Further, at any time, on \nthe basis of new information, the decision maker may on his or her own initiative reconsider the interim \nmeasures imposed and renew, revise, or revoke any or all of the measures, or impose additional interim \nmeasures. \n  U of A Policies and Procedures On-Line (UAPPOL) \ng. Interim measures will be re-evaluated when a complaint process is concluded. \n4. PROCEDURES TO ADDRESS COMPLAINTS \na. Complaints of sexual violence will be resolved according to the procedures set out in the University’s \nagreements with the Association of Academic Staff: University of Alberta (AASUA), the Non-Academic Staff \nAssociation (NASA), the Graduate Student Assistantship Collective Agreement, the Postdoctoral Fellows \nDiscipline Procedure, the Code of Student Behaviour, the Residence Agreement, Practicum Intervention \nPolicy, and any other applicable contracts, agreements or policies. \nb. In all cases, use of the procedures at the University does not preclude a report to the appropriate law \nenforcement agency, professional governing body, or pursuing any other civil or other remedy available at \nlaw. \nStudents \nc. Complaints of sexual violence against students will be addressed using procedures outlined in one or more of \nthe following documents. When the person accused in the complaint is:  \ni. a student, the Code of Student Behaviour, \nii. a student living in a University Residence, the Breach of Residence Agreement process,  \niii. a student in a practicum placement, the Practicum Intervention Policy; \niv. a graduate student while appointed in a role as a graduate teaching assistant, graduate research \nassistant or short-term academically-related employment at the time of the offence, the Graduate Student \nAssistantship Collective Agreement. \nAs noted, students may be subject to more than one procedure and may, therefore, be subject to several \nprocedures concurrently.  \nEmployees, postdoctoral fellows and volunteers \nd. Complaints of sexual violence against employees, postdoctoral fellows and volunteers will be resolved \nthrough the following procedures. When the person accused in the complaint is:  \ni. a member of the Non Academic Staff Association (NASA) or the Association of Academic Staff: \nUniversity of Alberta (AASUA), the processes outlined in the applicable collective agreement; \nii. a postdoctoral fellow, the Postdoctoral Fellows Discipline Procedure; \niii. an employee under an employment contract or agreement, but not subject to the above collective \nagreements or policies, where no procedures are specified, the procedure will be determined on a case-\nby-case basis, ensuring that the accused person has the right to: \n1.  an impartial decision-maker, \n2.  know the case to be met, \n3.  an opportunity to respond to the allegations in the complaint, \n4.  be accompanied by an advisor, and \n5.  a timely resolution. \nOthers \ne. When the person accused in a complaint or disclosure is not a member of the University Community, the \nUniversity may address the matter through means including, but not limited to, the Trespass to Premises Act \nof Alberta or the Petty Trespass Act of Alberta, reports to the appropriate law enforcement agency or \nprofessional governing body. \n5. COMPLAINANT RIGHTS IN COMPLAINTS PROCESS \na. The applicable procedures for investigating and adjudicating complaints of sexual violence are required to \nadhere to the principles of procedural fairness. Adherence to such principles is necessary to ensure that \npersons accused of sexual violence are protected by receiving a fair adjudication. At the same time, the \nprocedures for investigating and adjudicating complaints of sexual violence must also be conducted with due \n  U of A Policies and Procedures On-Line (UAPPOL) \nregard to their effects on the complainant. Having such regard is necessary in recognition that investigatory \nand adjudicative processes can themselves cause additional trauma to a complainant. In balancing these \nobligations, investigators and adjudicators will be mindful to conduct their functions in a way that reduces, to \nthe extent possible, the risk of additional harm to the complainant, while ensuring procedural fairness for the \nperson accused in the complaint. \nb. Without limiting the foregoing, where not already provided for in any complaints process related to sexual \nviolence at the University, the complainant will have the right to: \ni. be accompanied by a support person throughout their participation in any investigatory or disciplinary \nproceedings, \nii. be informed of, make and respond to procedural requests, \niii. make oral or written representations on their own behalf, through their support person or other \nappropriate party, regarding impact and sanction, \niv. receive a copy of the written reasons for the decision. \n6. PREVENTION, EDUCATION AND TRAINING \na. Further information about: \n receiving and managing a disclosure of sexual violence, can be found in the University’s Responding to a \nDisclosure of Sexual Assault, available at https://www.ualberta.ca/current-students/sexual-assault-\ncentre/responding \n support services and resources for persons affected by sexual violence can be found in the University’s \nOptions, Services and Resources for Those who have Experienced Sexual Violence Information \nDocument. \n the steps or measures the University can take, including modifications to academic program(s), University \nresidence, recreational or other programs, or work environment, in response to a disclosure of sexual \nviolence can be found in the University’s Options, Services and Resources for Those who have \nExperienced Sexual Violence Information Document. \nb. The University will provide education to the entire University community on sexual violence including, but not \nlimited to, policy awareness, consent and responding to disclosures.  \ni. Additional workshops will be offered for those more likely to receive disclosures. \nii. Training in bystander intervention, provided on a voluntary basis to students and staff. \nc. All persons (i) investigating complaints of sexual violence, and (ii) adjudicating complaints of sexual violence \nin the complaint resolution procedures outlined above must have appropriate training. \nd. Information on appropriate training can be found in the University’s Sexual Violence Education and Training \nInformation Document. \nDEFINITIONS \nDefinitions should be listed in the sequence they occur in the document (i.e. not alphabetical). \nAny definitions listed in the following table apply to this document only with no implied or intended \ninstitution-wide use.

Such conditions may be \nimposed in response to a disclosure or complaint. The purposes of \ninterim measures are to ensure the safety of the person who disclosed \nor of the University’s learning, working and University residence \nenvironment, to discourage or prevent retaliation, prevent further \nsexual violence and/or preserve the University’s ability to conduct a \nthorough investigation.

This \ndocument is intended to provide a non-exhaustive list of the various options available so that all students, staff, postdoctoral fellows and faculty \ncan assist in making appropriate referrals upon receiving a disclosure or make informed decisions for themselves after experiencing sexual \nviolence.  \nIndividual reactions to sexual violence will differ greatly, and a person's decision about how to respond to an experience of sexual violence may \nchange over time. Whether the result of a disclosure or a complaint, the University can assist with some of those responses, including providing \nacademic, work or University residence modifications, safety planning, personal support, making a complaint or other options that meet the goals \nof the Sexual Violence policy and related procedures.  \nSome may need a more comprehensive and coordinated response. The SVRT (Sexual Violence Response Team) is convened when an individual \ndiscloses that they have experienced sexual violence, and may need more than one modification to meet the goals of the Sexual Violence policy. \nIt is designed to provide access to multiple options, resources and responses without the individual having to approach each service separately.  \nIt should be understood that mediation is not appropriate for situations involving sexual violence. Mediation is a conflict resolution mechanism that \npresumes all parties have an equal role in resolving a conflict. Sexual violence is not a conflict, but a harm inflicted on another person. Mediation \nintroduces a significant risk of additional harm to the person to whom the violence was done and should never be considered an option in cases of \nsexual violence. \nWHAT ARE MY OPTIONS? \nPersonal Support | Medical Assistance | Safety | Modifications – Academic/Work/Living | Complaints | Other Resources and Services \nOptions, Resources and Services Information Document     Page 2 \nPersonal\tSupport\t\nOPTION HOW DO I DO THIS?

As one example, if a \nvictim did not scream or fight or say “no,” the assumption may be that there must have been implicit consent. These \nassumptions can be held by anyone receiving a disclosure, investigating, or adjudicating a complaint, or even by \nthose who have experienced sexual violence themselves. Education on these and other topics is designed to correct \nthese misconceptions. In addition, research on the potential effects of trauma on memory, recall and behaviour sheds \nnew light on methods for interviewing those who have experienced trauma. \nThe goals of education, bystander intervention and other training are to help those who experience sexual violence \nfeel safer in disclosing and/or making a complaint and seeking support; ensure that those who receive disclosures \nknow how to support and refer; allow investigators to use trauma-informed interview techniques in order to get the \nbest information possible from complainants; and ensure that decision-makers in complaint processes are able to \nappropriately interpret the evidence before them. Below is a non-exhaustive list of selected training and education \nopportunities. Any other relevant training should also be considered, as appropriate. \nFOR THE UNIVERSITY COMMUNITY \nThe resources below are available to members of the University community at no cost and provide education and \ntraining in the areas of understanding sexual assault, consent, bystander intervention, gender based violence, effects \nof trauma and trauma-informed interviewing.  \nSexual Assault Centre (no cost) \n Videos: Understanding Sexual Assault \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3j3qgLRQaIw&list=PL2V1RRG3M1rTKPuhw2eHWvVlVcrBcDKsH&index\n=1  \n Online guide: How to Respond to a Disclosure of Sexual Violence https://www.ualberta.ca/current-\nstudents/sexual-assault-centre/responding \n Working for Change workshops: Email edcoord@ualberta.ca  \nthe Landing (no cost) \nThe Gender Based Violence Prevention Program (GBVPP) is a campus and community-wide initiative designed to \nincrease awareness, education, communication, inclusion and safety.

Silence \nor ambiguity do not constitute consent. \nAdditionally, there is no consent when: \n it is given by someone else. \n the person is unconscious, sleeping, highly intoxicated or high, \nor otherwise lacks the capacity to consent. \n it was obtained through the abuse of a position of power, trust \nor authority. \n the person does not indicate “yes”, says “no” or implies “no” \nthrough words or behaviours. \n the person changes their mind and withdraws their consent. \nConsent cannot be implied (for example, by a current or past \nrelationship, by consent to another activity, or by failure to say “no” or \nresist). In addition, consent cannot be given in advance of sexual \nactivity that is expected to occur at a later time. It is the responsibility of \nthe person wanting to engage in sexual activity to obtain clear consent \nfrom the other and to recognize that consent can be withdrawn at any \ntime. \nComplainant An individual who makes a complaint under a University process. \nRELATED LINKS \nShould a link fail, please contact uappol@ualberta.ca.

Until 2016, this course was mandatory for students enrolled \nin Mining Engineering and Petroleum Engineering, while it was an \napproved program elective for many other programs. This course has \nbeen traditionally offered only in the Fall term and is well received by the \nstudents. In the past few years, two sections have been offered. The \ncourse has multiple evaluation methods: mid-terms, final exams and a \nsmall project. \nFuture state: Starting 2016, all students admitted into specialized \nengineering programs are required to take ENGG 404. This is part of the \nfaculty’s commitment towards educating future engineers on this very \nimportant topic. The specific terms in which each ENGG 404 is scheduled \nvaries from one program to another. Accordingly, at steady-state, ENGG \n404 will be offered in all three terms in order to accommodate all students \nin engineering. Based on current statistics, the projected enrollment for \nENGG 404 is provided in the table below. \nYear AY 2016-2017 \nAY 2017-\n2018 AY 2018-2019 AY 2019-2020 \nTerm F W S-S F W \nS-\nS F W S-S F W S-S \nProjected \nenrollment 250 - - 300 - - 570 250 130 700 320 125 \nRationale for requesting consolidated exams: As it can be seen from \nthe above table multiple sections become necessary to accommodate the \ngrowing numbers. For example, at steady state, we expect 700 students \nto be enrolled in the Fall term translating into ≈5 to 6 sections. In order to \nensure consistency in the exams, a consolidated mid-term and final exam \nseems necessary. We are currently working with the Faculty student \nservices to schedule consolidated mid-terms and would like to request \nItem No. 8 \nGFC EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE \nFor the Meeting of December 5, 2016 \nGFC’s approval of consolidated final exams for all terms (Fall, Winter and \nSpr/Sum) starting from Fall 2017. \nReplaces/Revises (eg, policies, \nresolutions) \nN/A \nTimeline/Implementation Date 2017/2018 academic year \nEstimated Cost and funding \nsource \nN/A \nNext Steps   \nSupplementary Notes and \ncontext \nEngagement and Routing (Include meeting dates) \nParticipation: \n(parties who have seen the \nproposal and in what capacity) \nFaculty of Engineering APC evote – approved Aug 22 2016 \nFaculty of Engineering ECC – approved Sept 20 2016 \nApproval Route (Governance) \n(including meeting dates) \nGFC Executive Committee – December 5, 2016 \nFinal Approver GFC Executive Committee \nAlignment/Compliance \nAlignment with Guiding \nDocuments \nFor the Public Good \nGOAL: SUSTAIN our people, our work, and the environment by \nattracting and stewarding the resources we need to deliver excellence to \nthe benefit of all Albertans. \nObjective 21: Encourage continuous improvement in administrative, \ngovernance, planning and stewardship systems, procedures, and \npolicies that enable students, faculty, staff, and the institution as a whole \nto achieve shared strategic goals. \nCompliance with Legislation, \nPolicy and/or Procedure \nRelevant to the Proposal \n(please quote legislation and \ninclude identifying section \nnumbers) \n1. Post-Secondary Learning Act (PSLA): Section 26(1)(d) of the \nPSLA gives GFC responsibility over “timetables for examination and \nfor lectures and other instruction.” \n2.
