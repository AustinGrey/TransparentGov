            "Description": "Purpose of the Proposal: To give APC the opportunity to reflect on the recent review of PLLC commissioned from Dr Peter Mackinnon, and the response to that review prepared by PLLC Vice-Principal Dr Martin Ferguson- Pell, and to engage in discussion about opportunities for the future evolution of PLLC and for leadership initiatives more broadly at the University of Alberta. Discussion: President Turpin provided members with an overview of the history of establishment of the Peter Lougheed Leadership College (PLLC), noting that it was created with funding provided by government and donors. He noted the concerns expressed by the community on how it was handled as an administrative initiative and further referenced the certificate which came forward to GFC for approval. The President referred to the report by Peter MacKinnon, and the response from PLLC, included in the committee’s materials. In addition, the President noted that the term of the current principal, the Honorable Kim Campbell, would end in June 2018, and that provincial funding for this initiative would expire in 2025. Dr Turpin noted that as the university embarks on the search for new principal, it is timely to look at the PLLC’s mandate, direction, sustainability, and to use this to inform what characteristics would be needed in a new leader. He indicated that PLLC could be used as a broader umbrella to accommodate and facilitate other activities and opportunities for better collaboration. He mentioned a few potential opportunities such as the Global Academic Leadership Development Program, Executive Education, faculty and staff professional development activities. He noted that a small working group would be established to provide some strategic ideas and that feedback from campus stakeholders including deans and GFC would be sought. During the discussion, members discussed the importance of a timely strategy, the role of principal at the PLLC, and provided comments on the stretch experience and PLLC’s programming. Other comments were made on whether the focus of leadership being taught at the PLLC could include non-profit and public sectors, and how its programming interacts with leadership programs provided by individual Faculties. Questions arose concerning enrolment data for the PLLC, Peter Lougheed Hall residence rates, its unique governance model, financial sustainability, and whether revenue generation is being considered. Members also provided several suggestions for the direction of the PLLC, including providing more specific leadership mentorship experiences and a public service component. The President noted that consultation with deans has begun and they have signaled a willingness to collaborate on the future of the PLLC.",

Report to the University of Alberta President and Provost on the Peter Lougheed Leadership College by \nPeter MacKinnon \n2. Synthesis of Recommendations and Comments in Peter MacKinnon’s Report on The Peter Lougheed \nLeadership College (PLLC) by Martin Ferguson-Pell \nPrepared by: Kathleen Brough, Senior Administrative Officer, Office of the Provost and Vice-President \n(Academic) \n2\nReport to the University of Alberta President and Provost \non the Peter Lougheed Leadership College \nby Peter MacKinnon \nFebruary 2017 \n1 \nOn November 2, 3 and 4, 2016 I was on site at the University of Alberta for interviews and \ndiscussions in support of my review of the Peter Lougheed Leadership College under terms of \nreference that required me to assess (1) The strengths, weaknesses, challenges and \nopportunities of PLLC; (2) the merits of the academic and co-curricular programming offered by \nPLLC and the audience for this programming; and (3) PLLC's sustainability in three key areas: \nleadership, governance and finances. I participated in 25 meetings involving 67 participants, \nand received telephone and email submissions from others. \nI am grateful to all who met with me, or otherwise expressed their views. I must add my \ngratitude to Bobbi Schiestel of the president's office. She compiled background documents and \ninformation, coordinated an intensive interview schedule, and provided excellent support that \nmade the most of my time on campus. I thank her warmly. \nThe terms of reference shall be addressed in order. \nThe strengths, weaknesses, challenges and opportunities of PLLC \nStrengths \nThe interviews and supporting documents point to three strengths: a compelling vision with \nexisting and potentially further alignment with the University of Alberta Strategic Plan for 2016-\n2021; considerable progress in implementing the vision, and a commitment and esprit de corps \nwithin the college that is palpable. \nThe original vision is that of John and the late Bunny Ferguson who, on the death of Peter \nLougheed, sought to commemorate his legacy at their university. It rests on recognition that \nleadership is fundamentally important; that it can be learned, and that there is a discrete field of \nstudy and experience to support that learning. The Fergusons developed and carried their vision \nto public and private sector leadership in the university, province and beyond, and secured early \nand considerable financial support for its implementation. It finds contemporary expression in \nthe college's vision to serve as \"a thriving centre of excellence for leadership skills development \nwhere students are immersed in and benefit from leading-edge learning experiences.\" \nThe 2016-2021 University of Alberta Strategic Plan, For the Public Good, makes explicit \nreference to the objective of accessing \"leadership development programs for undergraduate \nand graduate students, such as the Peter Lougheed Leadership College.\" In addition, there are \ncountless references to leadership in the plan. These imply that there is an opportunity for the \nuniversity to reflect on the role that the systematic and interdisciplinary study of leadership may \nplay in the next stage of the university's evolution. As the university builds its portfolio of \n3\n2 \nsignature areas, perhaps leadership will be included among them. In its objective to attract \noutstanding students in Alberta, across Canada, and beyond, a unique and distinguished \ncapacity in leadership education and development might assist the university in recruiting the \nexceptional students it seeks to attract. Existing university capacity in French language \ninstruction and scholarship (Campus Saint-Jean) suggests potential opportunities to recruit \nstudents from French speaking regions in Canada and abroad. \nThere has been considerable progress in translating the PLLC vision into reality. \nComplementary first year courses are in place, as are second year courses devoted to \nworkshops and capstone projects. Co-curricular leadership projects and an ambitious instruction \ndevelopment model are evolving. And Peter Lougheed Hall, anticipated to be a residence and \nimportant college meeting and social centre will be open to students in September 2017. \nThe third strength is the evident commitment and esprit de corps within the college. The \nleadership is passionate about the program and potential; teaching fellows shared their passion; \nthe mentorship program is developing as planned; and, it must be emphasized, students are \nenthusiastic about the quality of their experience. Within a short time, and despite inevitable \ngrowing pains, the Peter Lougheed Leadership College has inspired enthusiastic commitment \namong its members that is notable in an organization so young. \nWeaknesses and Challenges \nFirst and most important, the college has both a short term and long term sustainability problem. \nFinancial commitments on a scale contemplated at its inception have not been confirmed. It was \nhoped that $105 million, one-third from the provincial government matched by the federal \ngovernment, with the remaining third from philanthropy, would be raised to support the initiative \nat each of the U of A and Banff Centre. This would have resulted in a pool of $210 million which \n- if endowed - could have supported the initiative in perpetuity. The reality is that only the \nprovincial commitment has been realized. A matching federal grant and philanthropic support at \nthe level anticipated are not in sight. This means that the provincial grant is not part of a larger \ninvestment fund to support the College in perpetuity. Instead it is being spent to pay for \noperations and for the capital costs of the building. \nWhat does this mean? First, provincial grant monies are being spent at a rate that could see \nthem exhausted before the expiry of the current ten year commitment. Second, upon the expiry \nof the provincial grant, continuing operations are in jeopardy unless new sources of revenue are \nconfirmed from within the university's operating budget or from external sources. Quite simply, \nas seen from 2016, the college is not sustainable. \nAnother challenge is the building that is expected to be its home: Peter Lougheed Hall. The \nuniversity will take delivery of the completed building early in 2017 and will welcome residence \nstudents the following September. The dream here is of a residential college of which there are \nmany examples worldwide. A notable Canadian example is Massey College at the University of \nToronto. \n4\n3 \nNorthrop Frye once observed that most of what we learn, we learn from one another. Peter \nLougheed Hall is intended to be more than a place to live while studying down the street or \nacross campus. It is was intended to be an interdisciplinary, intellectual community of the \ncollege's students living in proximity to one another with opportunities for informal dialogue and \nprogramming to enhance their study. This intention may not be realized. Without substantial \ninducements, it is unlikely that the hall's 143 spaces - or even half that number - will be \noccupied by PLLC students. A premium will be added to normal residence fees to reflect the \nquality of the space and the anticipated enhanced experience. The students are in their third \nand fourth years, a time at which many students prefer to live off campus. And the Edmonton \nhousing market has softened, for the foreseeable future at least, making off campus costs more \nfavourable in comparison to those of living in residence. \nA third weakness or challenge is what might be called a lack of equity in the college on the part \nof the wider University of Alberta community. The college was inspired by interests outside the \nuniversity's normal academic channels. It was not integrated from its inception within these \nchannels, and it has had an unsettled relationship with other parts of the university. There has \nbeen some softening of attitudes, in part attributable to the approval of the college's certificate \nprogram by General Faculties Council, and in part because there have been recent \ncollaborative efforts. But there remains a residual skepticism about the role of the college in the \nuniversity. \nOpportunities \nLeadership can be taught, and there are innumerable conferences, workshops, books and \nprograms to that end. But in Canada there is only one university college committed to \nleadership skills development: PLLC. It is now an established fact, though it rests on a \nprecarious foundation, and the question before the university is clear: after present \ncommitments are met, will the college succumb to its sustainability issues, or is distinction in the \nstudy of leadership a goal to which the university aspires? Struggling along with an uncertain \nfuture is not an option at an institution of the stature and repute of the University of Alberta. \nIn the short term there are measures that might be taken to stabilize the college. First, a \nbalanced budget in 2017-18 and subsequent years should be finalized. Second, the college \ncould explore the potential for a more equitable sharing of expenditures on this partnership \ninitiative between U of A and The Banff Centre. (the 3.5 million annual grant is being drawn \ndown at PLLC with deficits, while The Banff Centre is accumulating annual surpluses). Third, \nthe $10,000 awards to students are no longer affordable. Phasing out of the $2500 awards in \neach of years 1 and 2 is underway. The $5,000 committed to the stretch experience awards \ncould instead be a credit against fees at Peter Lougheed Hall; this would be an inducement to \nPLLC students to live there. Fourth, PLLC should explore revenue generating opportunities from \nlending its expertise in leadership programs to other organizations. \n5\n4 \nThese are possibilities only and, whatever their merits, they will not in themselves assure the \nsustainability of PLLC beyond the ten year agreement with the provincial government. That will \nrequire additional resources from government and philanthropy or a university commitment to \noperating budget support. \nMerits of PLLC Academic and Co-curricular Programming \nA second year of operation is too soon to assess these but some observations can be made. I \nheard no criticism of the academic programming; on the contrary, those in the university who \nhad an opinion on the subject viewed it positively, and PLLC staff and students are enthusiastic \nabout its quality. Some concern was expressed about its demanding nature for students already \ntaking a full course load but this could be alleviated if PLLC courses were approved as electives \nfor credit in all faculties. \nBanister Research Associates has been commissioned to undertake a review of the co-\ncurricular programs, and some results from their questionnaires are expected by year end. In \nthe interim I would suggest that the stretch program appears to be unfocused. Clearer criteria \nare needed to identify what is (and what is not) a stretch program as distinct from paid summer \nemployment. It has been suggested above that the $5 thousand award for all students in the \nprogram be used instead as a credit toward fees in Peter Lougheed Hall. An alternative might \nbe to commit some of these funds to needs based bursaries. \nI heard that the mentorship program is developing as planned. Forty mentors have been \nrecruited and demands on them are highly variable. They are available to those who seek them \nout but are not assigned to students, and this might be reconsidered. The Banister review \nshould provide more information on this subject. \nThe most challenging concerns were those expressed about the relationship between this \nprogram and other leadership initiatives at the University of Alberta. The external origins and \nearly implementation of the PLLC initiative meant that there has been no wider university \nconsideration of its nature and availability. GFC approval of the certificate was a positive step \nbut it was after the fact and not a substitute for systematic attention to program structure and \navailability, and to the relationship between PLLC and other U of A leadership commitments. \nThe sustainability issue is germane here. PLLC's long term sustainability requires that it be \nembedded within the university. It may be time to commission a university wide council of deans \nor associate deans and students to work with college leadership to this end. \n6\n5 \nPLLC's Sustainability in Leadership, Governance and Finances \nThe third of these, finances, has been addressed above and I repeat for emphasis: PLLC has \nshort and long term financial sustainability issues that must be addressed now. \nThe college has dedicated and creative leadership but on account of its origins, and its \ndesignation as an administrative rather than an academic unit, appointment and succession \nprocesses did not receive the attention usually devoted to them in the university context. \nPLLC's governance arrangements, including the present Academic Oversight Committee, are \nad hoc and fall short of what will be necessary to embed PLLC within the university and assure \nits sustainability. The administration of PLLC should report to the provost's office rather than to \nthe university president, with the resources of that office committed to early consideration of \nappointment and reappointment processes, and to the role of PLLC in the wider university. \n7\n1 \n Synthesis of Recommendations and Comments in Peter MacKinnon’s Report on \nThe Peter Lougheed Leadership College (PLLC) \nMay 2017 \nMartin Ferguson-Pell, Vice-Principal, PLLC \nThe PLLC is grateful for Peter MacKinnon’s support for the College’s vision, and appreciates his \nthoughtful input. This synthesis document is a response to the strengths, weaknesses, challenges and \nopportunities laid out in the MacKinnon Report. \nSTRENGTHS, WEAKNESSES, CHALLENGES AND OPPORTUNITIES OF PLLC \nStrengths \nStrategic Plan Alignment: There are explicit references to PLLC and also many references to \n“leadership” in the U of A Strategic Plan. PLLC is ready and poised to contribute to For the Public \nGood as the plan unfolds. \nLeadership as a possible signature area: There are interesting opportunities here. Leadership \nencompasses a broad set of soft skills that employers have identified as needed and sometimes \nlacking in the typical accomplished graduate. It is important to recognize that the need for these \nsoft skills in graduating students has been studied and illuminated by academic studies and is \nsupported by evidence. \nRecruitment of exceptional students:  We have seen progress in this area with the recruitment of a \nLoran scholar for the 2017-19 cohort and PLLC’s contribution in preparing a student from the \nFaculty of Science to be elected a Rhodes Scholar. Other excellent results include PLLC scholars \nbeing admitted to prestigious, very competitive professional programs such as in medicine, law and \nrehabilitation medicine. PLLC scholars who applied for QE2 scholarships in 2016 had a very high \nsuccess rate and their skills at interview were particularly commended. \nWeaknesses and Challenges \nFinancial sustainability: Throughout the development of PLLC we have been careful to plan for \nfinancial sustainability and enable growth to reach an intake of about 125 students per year, with \nsufficient funds to complete the 10-year GOA grant period (2024-25). We have included in our \nplanning projected inflation costs that were not accounted for in the original fixed-cost funding \nmodel.  \nNeed for new sources of revenue: New revenue sources will need to be identified from 2025 \nonwards, and we recommend consideration be given to opportunities to raise revenue in the \ninterest of PLLC’s long-term sustainability. \nManaging a full course load: It is true that if more programs could accept PLLC courses as elective \nthis would reduce the workload of PLLC students. We tend to hear this concern in the first semester \nof the first year. Discussions with second year students indicate that the skills they learn provide \n8\n2 \nnumerous systemic benefits that lead to less pressure in the winter term of year one and the second \nyear. \nPLLC, through the teaching fellows and forum structure, work closely with any students needing \nsupport. Lead Instructors, teaching fellow and the Director of Instruction hold regular office hours \nand refer students to support services if necessary. This early intervention approach is beneficial \nnot only to the student’s academic performance in PLLC, but also to academic performance in their \nprimary degree subjects. \nStretch Experience: We agree that the first year stretch program needs further development. \nChanges have already been put in place for the 2016-18 cohort; and we will continue to closely \nmonitor the program.  \nWe would like to emphasize that one of the signature features of the PLLC stretch experience is the \nopportunity to tailor the experience to each student’s personal strategy, gaps in experiences and \npersonal passions while requiring all stretch experiences to include 200+ hours of voluntary work \nfor the social benefit of the community in which the stretch experience is conducted. The \nunderlying pedagogy is to create a personal strategic challenge that some students are ill-equipped \nto handle without the support provided by the PLLC team during the planning stages.  The students \nlearn and mature through this process, an important skill for life. The mentors also play an active \nrole in connecting scholars to opportunities and supporting them through the stretch experience. \nThe process of creating the stretch experience by the scholar is as important as the experience \nitself. Opportunities to assume the responsibility of designing a learning experience, to reflect on \npersonal priorities and ambitions, and to be creative in meeting the specifications of the program \nare a rare experience for the typical, highly regulated North American undergraduate. The stretch \nexperience is therefore an important opportunity for scholars to examine their values and personal \nnarrative. \nWith regard to the stretch experience student funding, we respectfully disagree that the $5,000 \naward should be reallocated to create residence bursaries. To reallocate these funds would create \naccess issues and inequities for students who do not have the means to lose 200 hours of otherwise \npaid work during the summer. The $5,000 is closely benchmarked to funding provided for \nundergraduate research experiences by U of A, NSERC, AIHS, CIHR. \nRelationship with other U of A leadership initiatives: When PLLC was first being developed, the \nLougheed Academic Consultative Committee (LACC) was formed to ensure that broad university-\nwide perspectives were included in the planning process. LACC included faculty members, \nundergraduate student representative, graduate student representatives and deans of interested \nfaculties and units (Arts, Science, Engineering, Augustana, Dean of Students, UAI, PER). A \nsubcommittee was subsequently formed to undertake a horizon scan of leadership programs at U of \nA so that there was awareness of other programs by the PLLC leadership.  \nClose links were formed with Alberta Students Leadership Summit (PLLC has participated in the \nSummit and provided significant funding to support it from January 2015). The Emerging Leaders \nprogram, and SU initiative has similarly been supported by PLLC as sponsors, participants and \nfacilitators. PLLC has also worked closely with the U of A Ambassadors program and more recently \nwith Gold College. PLLC participated fully in the SU and Provost sponsored Interdisciplinary \nLearning conference on February 4, 2017. PLLC has also funded 10 students each year from the \nAlberta School of Business Certificate in Leadership to attend the residential Banff Retreat PLLC \nholds for its scholars. The Lougheed Lectures held every two weeks during term time are open to all \n9\n3 \non campus and beyond. We are in discussions with Campus St. Jean to consider how a version of the \nFoundations of Leadership course could be provided in French. We have worked closely with \nFaculty of Extension to share experiences with their leadership programming. Without doubt there \nare other further opportunities to extend PLLC’s collaborative activities, but these are naturally \nlimited by resources and the capacity of the lean PLLC administrative team.  \nCouncil of Deans: PLLC feels that that an advisory group of deans with a focus on strategic \ndevelopment of PLLC rather than operational oversight process would be beneficial to the further \ndevelopment of the College. Academic guidance can always be offered in this context. \nPeter Lougheed Hall: At this point, given feedback from current students in PLLC, it is unlikely that \nthe original goal of two cohorts of PLLC scholars living throughout their PLLC experience in \nresidence will be realized in the short to medium term. However, the public spaces of PLH will be of \ngreat value in providing PLLC with a physical focal point and a gathering place for PLLC scholars. \nPLH will accommodate many of PLLC’s activities such as talks and special events. In most cases \nthese opportunities will be extended to other residents in PLH creating a lively setting for \nleadership-related activities. \nThe role of the college in the university: We do not understand the skepticism surrounding PLLC and \nits role in the university, and need more guidance. Like many prestigious programs at U of A, PLLC \nis selective. The criteria for selection are widely available for review and were the result of 9 focus \ngroups with students facilitated by SU in December 2014. We seek students who have the passion, \npotential and commitment for an intensive academic and co-curricular experience.  \nWe agree with Dr. MacKinnon’s statement that “Leadership can be taught …” The concern raised by \ncolleagues with Dr. MacKinnon about this point appears to misunderstand the learning goals of \nPLLC. PLLC is not intended to generate leaders, but to provide opportunities for undergraduate \nstudents to learn leadership skills and practice them through experiential learning opportunities \nthat will serve them in many ways in their careers so that they can live consequential lives, with \nwhatever focus or role in society they may choose. All activities undertaken by PLLC, academic and \nco-curricular, are respectful of academic values. The content seeks specifically to develop \nunderstanding and insights for developing leadership skills. PLLC seeks to create an atmosphere of \nfreedom to discuss issues within the trust of a forum structure.  By creating an environment that is \nconducive to free and open discussion we create an environment that is more open to creative \nlearning and deeper understanding. \nOpportunities \nOptions for the Future: We agree the long-term financial sustainability of PLLC is a concern. PLLC’s \ncurrent budget approach will allow it to deliver content on the scale and quality originally intended \nuntil 2024-25, at which point the University, the Government of Alberta and the community at large \nwill need to make a decision for the long term. There will be 10 years of longitudinal data collected \nto demonstrate the value proposition of continuing PLLC by that time. We will have the opportunity \nto make a decision based on solid evidence.  \nMore equitable sharing of expenditures with Banff Centre: The Banff Centre, at least for the short \nterm, has agreed to cover the cost of the Banff Retreat. However, beyond this and several other \nareas of significant collaboration, we believe it is unlikely that The Banff Centre would cover costs \nthat are explicitly related to the academic costs of PLLC or the costs of Peter Lougheed Hall. \n10\n4 \nStudent Awards: We introduced the $2,500 per year award in response to concerns raised by SU \nand LACC about equitable access to PLLC for students who rely on working (especially in the \nevenings) to cover their tuition and living costs.  This is not an extraordinarily large award and is \nadministered by the Office of the Registrar. We resisted means testing this award. However, with \nPLLC scaling up it is clear that this element of the funding to students is no longer affordable and we \npropose and have budgeted for it to be replaced by a bursary fund to be administered by the Office \nof the Registrar. At present about 10% of PLLC scholars are already receiving a bursary from UofA. \nWe do not share the view that the summer stretch experience funding should be withdrawn and \nthis cost remains in the balanced budget. It is important to recognize that the stretch experience \nrequires a minimum of 200 hours of voluntary work for the social good of the community and that \nno other bursaries are available to cover off this activity outside the normal academic term. \nRevenue Generating activities: Extensive analysis has been undertaken to consider the benefits, \nfeasibility and business case for a residential summer school. This could both generate net revenue \nfor PLLC programming and also increase utilization of PLH. We request that the university give \nserious consideration to conducting a summer school pilot in 2018. \nLending expertise to other organizations: There is potential but with caution. At present there is \ninsufficient capacity in PLLC to take on contract work. There may be other groups on campus \n(Faculty of Extension, School of Business) that might want to take the lead on such initiatives and \nPLLC could certainly provide expertise in exchange for a revenue share in support of them. \n11\nItem No. 7 \nGFC ACADEMIC PLANNING COMMITTEE \nFor the Meeting of October 11, 2017 \n OUTLINE OF ISSUE \nAdvice, Discussion, Information Item  \nAgenda Title: Annual Report on Undergraduate Student Financial Support \nItem   \nProposed by Lisa Collins, Vice Provost and University Registrar \nPresenter Lisa Collins, Vice Provost and University Registrar  \nFiona Halbert, Assistant Registrar – Student Financial Support \nDetails \nResponsibility Office of the Registrar \nThe Purpose of the item is \n(please be specific) \nTo discuss the Annual Report on Undergraduate Student Financial \nSupport as per APC’s mandate.

Authority\nThe Post-Secondary Learning Act gives General Faculties Council (GFC) responsibility, subject to the \nauthority of the Board of Governors, over \"academic affairs\" (section 26(1)). Section 26(1)(o) provides \nthat GFC may make recommendations to the Board of Governors on a number of matters, including \n\"the budget\" and \"academic planning.\" GFC has thus established an Academic Planning Committee \n(GFC APC), as set out below. GFC delegates certain of its powers to the GFC Academic Planning \nCommittee.  \nThe complete wording of the section(s) of the Post-Secondary Learning Act, as referred to above, and \nany other related sections, should be checked in any instance where formal jurisdiction or delegation \nneeds to be determined. \n2. Composition of the Committee\nEx officio \n• Provost and Vice-President (Academic), Chair\n• Vice-President (Research)\n• Vice-President (Finance & Administration)\n• President of the Students' Union\n• President of the Graduate Students' Association\nMembers Elected by General Faculties Council \n• Four academic staff elected by and from GFC (Category A1.1 and A1.6 and their counterparts\nin A1.5 and A1.7) \n• Two academic staff-at-large (Category A1.1 and A1.6 and their counterparts in A1.5 and A1.7)\n• One NASA member (Category S1.0) at-large\n• One Dean\n• One Department Chair-at-large\n• One undergraduate student-at-large\n• One graduate student-at-large\nNon-Voting Members \n• One faculty member of the GFC Executive, appointed by the Chair of the GFC Executive.\n• The Provost and Vice-President (Academic) may ask any resource person to attend for any\nitem(s). It is recognized the Vice-Provost and University Registrar will routinely be in attendance\nat APC as a non-voting observer/resource person. (GFC 29 SEP 2003)\nNOTE: APC will elect one of the APC academic staff members to serve as Vice-Chair.  \nAPC shall appoint one of its elected faculty members as a cross-representative to the FDC.  \nThe President, as Chair of GFC, may attend at his or her discretion any meeting of APC in order to \npresent any item or to receive advice from APC. \n3. Mandate of the Committee\nThe Academic Planning Committee (APC) is GFC's senior committee dealing with academic, financial \nand planning issues. As such, it is not only responsible to GFC (or the Board) for the specific matters \nitemized below, but may also ask to consider or recommend to GFC on any academic issue, including \n1) those issues under the purview of other GFC committees, 2) any academic issue related to\nrestructuring, 3) any research-related issue, or 4) issues linked to academic service units where those \nissues have a significant academic impact. In like manner, the President, Provost and Vice-President \n(Academic) or other Vice-Presidents may refer any matter to APC for consideration or recommendation \nto GFC. APC is also responsible to GFC for promoting an optimal learning environment for students \nand excellence in teaching, research, and graduate studies. (GFC 29 SEP 2003) \nAttachment 2\n7\nAPC is responsible for making recommendations to GFC and/or to the Board of Governors concerning \npolicy matters and action matters with respect to the following: \n1.

Additional Reporting Requirements \nNone. \nR:\\GO04 General Faculties Council - General\\PRO\\TER\\APC\\Academic-Planning-Committee-Amended.doc \nApproved November 26, 2007 (GFC) \n11\nRESEARCH GOVERNANCE AND THE ACADEMIC PLANNING COMMITTEE \nGFC is responsible for the academic affairs of the university, which should be understood to include \nsetting and overseeing policies that have broad consequences for the facilitation, conduct, and \nmanagement of research. In practice, some aspects of decision-making authority regarding research-\nrelated issues are delegated to executive and administrative decision makers, including to researchers \nthemselves. This is consistent with good governance, effective administration, and academic freedom. \nHowever, consistent with the principles of collegial academic governance, GFC maintains authority over \ncore, framework-defining research policies. The question the ad hoc committee considered was where, \nwithin the GFC committee structure, responsibility for research policy should be delegated. \nConsideration of this question is motivated, in part, by a desire to ensure sufficient attention and \npriority is dedicated to an area of policy that is central to the university’s success and stature as a major \nresearch-intensive university.  \nBackground \nGFC has not had a stand-alone research committee since 1976, when the Research Committee was \ndisbanded and its responsibilities were transferred to the Council of the Faculty of Graduate Studies. At \nsome point, however, GFC committees reassumed authority over research policy, but in the context of \ncommittees with broader responsibilities for academic development and planning. Currently, the \nAcademic Planning Committee (APC) has primary responsibility for research. As a senior GFC committee, \nAPC is empowered to consider or recommend to GFC on any academic issue, including “any research-\nrelated issue.” APC is, moreover, specifically empowered to make recommendations concerning policy \nmatters and actions respecting research-related matters such as establishing or terminating endowed \nand funded chairs and academic centres and institutes.  \nDespite the fact that APC has a mandate that extends to the full range of research policies and issues, \nthe 2014 Task Force on GFC Reforms reported that research matters are “seldom addressed in GFC \ncommittees.” Research and research policy do not receive extensive or sustained attention by GFC or \nany of its committees. \nAt present, the committee that deals most directly with research and research policy is the University \nResearch Policy Committee (URPC). URPC is an advisory committee to the Vice-President Research, \nmakes recommendations on research policy and decision-making, and serves as a conduit through \nwhich administrative policies are transmitted to faculty members. It does not make recommendations \ndirectly to GFC or any of its committees – it is a committee of ‘administration’, not ‘governance’. \nMany Canadian universities have standalone research committees as a part of their governance \nstructure. A number of university Senates (Note: outside Alberta the university Senate is equivalent to \nour General Faculties Council) have standing Research Committees, including: UBC, Calgary, \nSaskatchewan, Manitoba, Western, and Queen’s. Some of these committees have broad responsibility \nthat, like the University of Alberta’s APC, includes ‘learning and research’ or ‘academic programs and \nresearch’. But, others have more narrow mandates focused specifically on research. The key \ncommonalities in the terms of reference for these committees include responsibility for advising on \nresearch policy, promoting institutional research, governing centres and institutes, and receiving and \nreviewing reports related to matters such as funding by granting agencies and human and animal ethics. \nThe University of Calgary’s Research and Scholarship Committee is characterized as GFC’s “primary \nadvisory group on research and scholarly initiatives, issues, and activities.” The ad hoc committee \nEndorsed by GFC April 21, 201711\nAttachment 3\nExcerpt from ad hoc report\n12\nbelieves it is essential that a research-intensive institution, such as the University of Alberta, have an \nacademic governance committee mandated to consider high-level research issues as a part of its \ngovernance structure.  \nOptions and Recommendations \nThe 2014 Task Force on GFC reforms pointed out that it is not inconsistent with good governance to \ndelegate most or all decision-making authority regarding research-related issues to well-chosen \nexecutives such as the Vice-President (Research) and administrative decision-making bodies like URPC. \nBut, such delegation limits GFC’s active responsibility for an area of policy that is central to academic \naffairs and reduces opportunities for collegial self-governance. Thus, the ad hoc committee was quick to \nreject more explicit administrative delegation and focused, instead, on two options for clarifying and \nfocusing renewed attention on research policy within the structures of GFC. \n1.) Amend APC’s terms of reference to clarify in more detail its delegated authority with regard to \nresearch-related issues: \nThis option would clarify (for GFC and the university community) the place of research policy in \ngovernance, and enhance the extent to which the committee would be more proactive in taking up \nresearch-related issues. It would likely result in research issues being addressed more regularly in the \ncontext of a senior GFC committee, while not negatively impacting the productive role that URPC has \ncome to play as an advisory committee to the Vice-President (Research). It would, however, be \nimportant to ensure that any amendments to APC’s terms of reference did not leave the committee \nover stretched. APC already meets very frequently and has a wide variety of concerns to address.  \n2.) Delegate authority over research-related issues to a new research-focused committee – the GFC \nResearch Committee: \nRather than leave responsibility for research policy and research-related issues with APC, which is \ncurrently the GFC committee with the broadest mandate and responsibilities, GFC could establish a new \ncommittee with new terms of reference focused specifically on research policy and related issues. To \navoid creating a new ‘layer’ of governance decision-making, this committee would have to assume full \nresponsibility for research matters currently delegated to APC, as well as for providing strategic advice \nto GFC on a broad range of research-related issues. The primary benefit of this option would be the \nrenewed focus on research policy and issues; it would create a dedicated space within the structures of \ncollegial governance for proactive research policy initiatives. It would be important, however, for this \ncommittee to avoid duplicating or undermining the value-added advisory role currently played by URPC. \nSome individuals consulted by the ad hoc committee wondered if, given the currently limited volume of \nresearch-related issues on the agendas of existing GFC committees, a new stand-alone GFC Research \nCommittee might find itself without a sufficiently full agenda. This could undermine the goal of \nincreasing the visibility and perceived importance of research to GFC. \nInitially, the ad hoc committee was predisposed to recommend the creation of a new stand-alone GFC \ncommittee with responsibility for research policy and research-related issues. However, when the \ncommittee’s deliberations shifted from the place of research in academic governance to the question of \nthe future of APC, opinions shifted. The committee agreed that APC’s role requires clarification. The \nexisting APC terms of reference identify a long list of responsibilities, but those do not seem to be \norganized around a clear perspective on the meaning of ‘academic planning’. Work on APC’s terms of \nEndorsed by GFC April 21, 20171213\nreference identified matters that are more properly the purview of the Executive or Academic Standards \nCommittee, as well as issues that could be addressed by a reinvigorated Committee on the Learning \nEnvironment (CLE) that is empowered to recommend directly to full GFC.  In time, the committee was \nconvinced that its goals related to the profile of research issues and policy could be achieved in concert \nwith clarifying the role and cleaning up the terms of reference for APC. A decision was taken to \nrecommend transforming APC into a new Academic and Research Planning Committee (ARPC).  \nRecommendation: THAT GFC’s Academic Planning Committee be replaced by an Academic and \nResearch Planning Committee (ARPC) \nRecommendation: THAT the new Academic and Research Planning Committee assume the academic \nplanning responsibilities of APC, as well as responsibility for research and research policy, including \nAcademic Centres and Institutes, research ethics, copyright and intellectual property, postdoctoral \nfellows, field research policy, and funded and endowed chairs   \nPROGRAM APPROVAL AND REGULATIONS \nA fundamental role of GFC in academic governance is to set university-wide academic regulations, and \napprove new programs and changes to existing programs. The role of GFC is distinct from the role of the \nOffice of the Provost and Vice-President (Academic) in overseeing the development of new programs \nand changes to existing programs and their alignment with institutional goals and the procedures set \nout by the Ministry of Advanced Education. \nThe approval pathways related to programs and regulations can be convoluted and burdensome for \nthose proposing them. The current standing committee structure does not appear to provide a cohesive \napproach to these activities as portions of proposals can follow different approval pathways; this results \nin the appearance of a confusing, slow and cumbersome pathway for approval of new programs, \nprogram changes and course changes.  \nThe recommendations in this section seek to ensure that the governance oversight expected by GFC is in \nplace and that proposals follow pathways that are clear and add value at each step. Some changes are \nproposed which add value to the proposal and some provide a more transparent and seamless pathway \nto approval. The changes will ensure: approval processes are streamlined yet rigorous; that necessary \nconsultations occur; that there is clarity with regard to which bodies have authority for particular \napprovals; that value is added at each step; and that resources are used efficiently. \nOnce the university’s internal processes have approved proposed programs, proposals must often be \nforwarded to the provincial government and the Campus Alberta Quality Council (CAQC) for approval. \nThis step often adds significant time to the final approval and should be taken into consideration by \nproposers.  \nThe Role of the Academic Standards Committee  \nASC plays an integral role in reviewing and approving matters related to programs, courses, and \nregulations. The recommendations that follow include utilizing the expertise of this committee even \nfurther by expanding its role in reviewing and providing advice on program proposals. \nPast reviews of GFC have called into question the high proportion of ex-officio members on this \ncommittee and the very few elected GFC members. The ad hoc committee also struggled with this issue \nEndorsed by GFC April 21,
