            "Description": "Presenter(s): Deborah Burshtyn, Associate Dean, Faculty of Graduate Studies and Research (FGSR); Jeffrey Johnson, Associate Dean, Education, School of Public Health; Ruth Wolf, Practicum Program Director, School of Public Health Purpose of the Proposal: The proposed calendar changes represent a restructuring of the core curricula across all seven of our current MPH degree programs. This involves a replacement of the current common core courses required for all MPH degree programs with a set of newly developed common core courses, and consequent revision of specialization requirements. Discussion: Dr Burshtyn noted that this proposal represents an overhaul for the program requirements for second level specializations in the Master of Public Health and that it is structured around outcomes and competencies. She also noted that this is a good example of how Dr Johnson noted that the redesign allows for a common core curriculum for all of the second level specializations that integrates these specializations and provides more interdisciplinary training. The program aims to prepare public health practitioners for a clinical environment. Dr Wolfe confirmed that equity and social justice are core values in public health and that Aboriginal health and marginal populations would be included in the courses. During the discussion, the importance of indigenous health was acknowledged and was being integrated into the core courses currently in development. Members expressed additional questions in relation to fees, terms, and the removal of certain courses in the redesign. It was also noted that the proposal represents a good example of program design.",

Dr Davidson provided an overview to the committee noting that the changes are student-focused and meet the Canadian Association of Schools of Nursing (CASN) accreditation standards and comply with competencies required by the College and Association of Registered Nurses of Alberta (CARNA). Dr Davidson explained that the new program aims to develop nurse leaders who can facilitate change in a clinical setting. Dr Yonge explained that a cross-walk program has been developed for students who entered the program in the fall of 2017 which will allow them to move into year two of the new programs in the fall of 2018. Members, during the discussion, commended the presenters for their inclusion of indigenous health.

She noted that the Provost Office is working with units to develop this information as the university does not allocate funding or track expenditure at the program level. Ms Finczak reviewed the methodology utilized to develop program-level budgets and the assumptions made. Members discussed direct and indirect costs, the challenges in allocating faculty time to a specific program, how to distinguish research and teaching activities, and service teaching. A member stated that this data should not be used as hard evidence of revenues and costs.

Peter Lougheed Leadership College (PLLC) - Next Steps  \nMaterials before members are contained in the official meeting file. \nPresenter(s): David Turpin, President \nGFC Academic Planning Committee 10/11/2017 \nPage 2 \nPurpose of the Proposal: To give APC the opportunity to reflect on the recent review of PLLC commissioned \nfrom Dr Peter Mackinnon, and the response to that review prepared by PLLC Vice-Principal Dr Martin Ferguson-\nPell, and to engage in discussion about opportunities for the future evolution of PLLC and for leadership \ninitiatives more broadly at the University of Alberta. \nDiscussion: \nPresident Turpin provided members with an overview of the history of establishment of the Peter Lougheed \nLeadership College (PLLC), noting that it was created with funding provided by government and donors.  He \nnoted the concerns expressed by the community on how it was handled as an administrative initiative and \nfurther referenced the certificate which came forward to GFC for approval. \nThe President referred to the report by Peter MacKinnon, and the response from PLLC, included in the \ncommittee’s materials. In addition, the President noted that the term of the current principal, the Honorable Kim \nCampbell, would end in June 2018, and that provincial funding for this initiative would expire in 2025.  \nDr Turpin noted that as the university embarks on the search for new principal, it is timely to look at the PLLC’s \nmandate, direction, sustainability, and to use this to inform what characteristics would be needed in a new \nleader. He indicated that PLLC could be used as a broader umbrella to accommodate and facilitate other \nactivities and opportunities for better collaboration. He mentioned a few potential opportunities such as the \nGlobal Academic Leadership Development Program, Executive Education, faculty and staff professional \ndevelopment activities. He noted that a small working group would be established to provide some strategic \nideas and that feedback from campus stakeholders including deans and GFC would be sought. \nDuring the discussion, members discussed the importance of a timely strategy, the role of principal at the PLLC, \nand provided comments on the stretch experience and PLLC’s programming. Other comments were made on \nwhether the focus of leadership being taught at the PLLC could include non-profit and public sectors, and how \nits programming interacts with leadership programs provided by individual Faculties.  Questions arose \nconcerning enrolment data for the PLLC, Peter Lougheed Hall residence rates, its unique governance model, \nfinancial sustainability, and whether revenue generation is being considered. \nMembers also provided several suggestions for the direction of the PLLC, including providing more specific \nleadership mentorship experiences and a public service component. \nThe President noted that consultation with deans has begun and they have signaled a willingness to collaborate \non the future of the PLLC. \n5. Deferred Maintenance  \nThere were no documents. \nPresenter(s): Andrew Sharman, Vice-President (Facilities and Operations); James Allen, Associate Vice-\nPresident (Operations and Maintenance); Philip Stack, Associate Vice-President (Risk Management Services) \nPurpose of the Proposal: To discuss deferred maintenance at the University of Alberta. \nDiscussion: \nVice-President (Facilities and Operations) Andrew Sharman informed the committee that the university receives \ntargeted money for deferred maintenance from the Government of Alberta. The Government definition of \ndeferred maintenance is maintenance that was not performed when it should have been or was scheduled but \ndid not occur. Therefore, it is delayed or deferred to a future period. \nGFC Academic Planning Committee 10/11/2017 \nPage 3 \nMr Allen provided a presentation to members highlighting institutional priorities including life, health and safety, \nand alignment with institutional plans. He reported on challenges faced by the institution including significant \nrepairs to the buildings completed between 1951-1975, and the costs associated with maintaining newer, more \ncomplex buildings. \nMr Stack reviewed of the impacts of deferred maintenance on research equipment noting that, although user \nfees may cover core facility maintenance, most Principal Investigators (PIs) are responsible for the maintenance \nof research equipment through research grants.  He clarified that some grants do not include funding specifically \nfor maintenance of research equipment. He reported that the risks associated with this include loss of research \nand harm to the institutional reputation.  He provided members with an overview of mitigation strategies \nincluding alarm systems and third party audits. \nDuring the discussion, questions arose about how the university might reduce deferred maintenance costs as \nwell as clarification around centralized IT support.  In addition, members discussed comparator institutions and \nwhether deferred maintenance projects could be handled in-house. \n6. Update on the Budget  \nThere were no documents. \nPresenter(s): Steven Dew, Chair, GFC APC, and Provost and Vice-President (Academic) \nPurpose of the Proposal: For information/discussion. \nDiscussion: \nThe Chair reported that the provincial reviews of tuition regulation and funding model are ongoing.  He stated \nthat the institutional budget for 2018-2019 is being prepared and that it will include a three year overview of the \nbudget.  A new budget model is in development to provide an aligned strategy for the allocation of funding.  \nDuring the discussion, questions arose about activities-based vs performance-based funding, as well as the \nmethod to determine how costs would be distributed. \nThe Chair noted that the new budget model will be brought before the committee as it develops. \n7. Annual Report on Undergraduate Student Financial Support  \nMaterials before members are contained in the official meeting file. \nPresenter(s): Lisa Collins, Vice-Provost and University Registrar; Fiona Halbert, Assistant Registrar, Student \nFinancial Support \nPurpose of the Proposal: To discuss the Annual Report on Undergraduate Student Financial Support as per \nAPC’s mandate. This Report provides a snap shot of the current state of undergraduate financial supports \nissued by the Office of the Registrar (RO) in the 2016/2017 fiscal year. \nDiscussion: \nMs Collins provided a summary of the Annual Report on Undergraduate Student Financial Support including \nsources of funding, individual areas of focus of funding, and impact. \nOn the issue of comparator institutions, Ms Collins noted that data is scarce and that it is difficult to compare the \ndata from institution to institution. Ms Halbert noted that the report only captures data that is accessible and that \nFaculty-based support, as well as government student loans, are not included within the report. \nGFC Academic Planning Committee 10/11/2017 \nPage 4 \nMembers provided a number of comments and questions including clarification of international student support, \nhow the impact of financial support is measured, and clarification on how data is collected \n8. Proposed Changes to the GFC Academic Planning Committee (APC) Terms of Reference  \nMaterials before members are contained in the official meeting file. \nPresenter(s): Steven Dew, Chair, and Provost and Vice-President (Academic) \nPurpose of the Proposal: To discuss and provide input into the proposed changes to terms of reference for the \nGFC Academic Planning Committee. \nDiscussion: \nThe Chair provided a summary of some of the proposed changes to the committee terms of reference including \nthe inclusion of research into the mandate of the committee and the subsequent name change to the Academic \nResearch and Planning Committee.   \nThe Chair, noting the time, indicated that full discussion on this item would resume at the next meeting. \nUniversity Secretary Marion Haggarty-France encouraged members to read the ad hoc Report on these \nproposed changes and to engage with colleagues on those changes in preparation for the discussions to come. \n9.

This \ninvolves a replacement of the current common core courses required for \nall MPH degree programs with a set of newly developed common core \ncourses, and consequent revision of specialization requirements. The \ntotal credit requirements for all degrees remain the same. The new \ncommon core courses were developed in response to several influences, \ninternal to the School of Public Health, but importantly addressing \nexternal considerations. \nOur current MPH degrees are structured in part as legacies of the \nhistorical structural and disciplinary silos in place when the School was \nformed in 2006, and expectations of our external accrediting body, the \nUS-based Council on Education for Public Health (CEPH). We received \n5-year CEPH accreditation in 2012, and are currently pursuing a \nrenewal. Over the past several years, CEPH has engaged in extensive \ndialogue through the Association of Schools and Programs of Public \nHealth (ASPPH), of which the School of Public Health is a member, \nabout the currency and practice relevance of course-based MPH \ndegrees. As a result of this process, many accredited public health \nprograms have undertaken curriculum renewal with a goal of improving \nthe practice readiness of graduates entering public health fields. \nMoreover, CEPH has adopted new guidelines that increase flexibility for \nschools and programs with respect to both specializations and \norganization of curriculum, with a view to greater integration and \ngeneralization. In October 2016, for the first time, CEPH specified MPH \nCore Competencies.  \nCoinciding with the CEPH-ASPPH processes, the SPH undertook a \ncomprehensive review of the core curriculum for our MPH degrees. The \nprocess was robust, taking almost four years, and involving a large \nnumber of SPH faculty, instructors, students, and graduates, as well as \nemployers and practitioners working in public health across sectors. As a \nItem No. 4 \nGFC ACADEMIC PLANNING COMMITTEE \nFor the Meeting of October 25, 2017 \nresult, our revised curricula: \n• Highlight the unique contributions of the disciplinary traditions of \npublic health; \n• Emphasize the commonalities that underlie the field and practice \nof public health; \n• Facilitate practice readiness – the MPH is a degree for public \nhealth practitioners; \n• Promote interdisciplinary learning and practice; \n• Reflect the continuing evolution of public health; \n• Build on the SPH’s connectivity to the systems that affect health. \nThe Impact of the Proposal is These new MPH curricula establish common ground for incoming MPH \nstudents from diverse backgrounds, thereby ensuring all students \ndevelop a solid understanding of public health as a field. This demanded \na shift in the design of our curricula from “Who is the lecturer and what \ndoes s/he want students to know?” to “What competencies does the \nMPH graduate need to perform as an effective public health \npractitioner?”  \nThe new common core courses involve integration of some of the \npractice-oriented content contained in the current, disciplinary-focused \ncommon core courses. As a consequence of this integration into the new \ncommon core, most of the MPH degrees required some changes in the \nspecialization course requirements, either to minimize redundancy, or \nmaintain prerequisites for advanced specialization courses. \nOur new MPH curricula align with: SPH and CEPH MPH Core \nCompetencies, comprising Knowledge, Attitudes/Values and Skills and \nSPH’s approved Role & Function statements, which reflect the jobs that \nMPH graduates will perform. Moreover, we believe our new MPH \ncurricula are forward thinking and innovative, and our integrated \ninterdisciplinary common core will distinguish our MPH degree from \nothers amid burgeoning of MPH programs in Canada. \nReplaces/Revises (eg, policies, \nresolutions) \nCurrent curricula for the MPH degree programs as found in the 2017-\n2018 Calendar. \nTimeline/Implementation Date For admissions to Fall 2018 (to be published in the 2018-2019 Calendar) \nEstimated Cost and funding \nsource \nNo additional resources are required, and no additional fees will be \ncharged to students.  \nNext Steps (i.e.,: \nCommunications Plan, \nImplementation plans) \nIn anticipation of Fall 2018 implementation of the approved new \ncurricula: \nCommunication: \n- Students admitted in or before Fall 2017 were advised to complete the \ncurrent core courses as soon as possible in the 2017-2018 and 2018-\n2019 academic years.  \n- The School is posting an announcement on our website for prospective \napplicants for 2018 admission letting them know that we have completed \nour MPH core curriculum review and anticipate implementing the new \ncore curricula in Fall 2018. They will be advised to watch for updates; we \nanticipate that the new curricula will be approved at the time we offer \nItem No. 4 \nGFC ACADEMIC PLANNING COMMITTEE \nFor the Meeting of October 25, 2017 \nadmission in April 2018 to new MPH students starting in the Fall 2018.  \nImplementation: \nAs we transition between current and new curricula: \n- All current core courses will be offered in the 2018-2019 academic \nyear. \n- We are monitoring the need for additional sections of the current core \ncourses to see whether additional sections will be needed for students \nadmitted in or before Fall 2017. Based on current assessment, we have \nscheduled an additional section of one current core course in Spring \n2018.  \n- An interdisciplinary Teaching Team comprised of senior faculty from \nour MPH specializations, an SPH Student Association representative, \nand an Adjunct Professor/Practitioner, has developed a curriculum map \nthat identifies MPH Core Competencies, Learning Goals and Learning \nObjectives, and indicates where they will be met in the approved new \ncore courses. Our MPH Degree Coordinator is leading this process, and \nCTL has facilitated some stages of this work. \n- This team is now considering sequence options for the new core \ncurricula, and starting to develop course syllabi. We anticipate meeting \nbiweekly to design the syllabi as a team, with a target date for \ncompletion of the first set of new core course syllabi no later than April \n2018, based on the sequence decision noted above. \n- Courses will be timetabled for Fall 2018-Winter 2019 academic year \nthis fall, considering the sequence decision noted above. \n- The School has a standard course syllabus template. The School’s \nCourse Approval Subcommittee (CAS), reporting to the Committee on \nEducational Policies and Procedures (CEPP), reviews and recommends \nall new course syllabi for adoption. Course descriptions have already \nbeen approved; syllabi do not require Faculty Council approval, but \nsyllabi will be provided to both CEPP and Faculty Council for information. \n- Most specialization courses will remain as is for the 2018-2019 \nacademic year. We expect that specializations will review and revise \ntheir courses following experience with the new curricula in its first year \nof implementation.  \nSupplementary Notes and \ncontext \nEngagement and Routing (Include meeting dates) \nParticipation: \n(parties who have seen the \nproposal and in what capacity) \n<For further information see \nthe link posted on \nthe Governance Toolkit section \nStudent Participation Protocol> \nThose who have been informed: \n• The Degree changes, and each key piece leading to them, were \npresented at the School’s Town Hall / Faculty Council meetings \nwhich are open to the entire SPH community – faculty, students, \nalumni, and stakeholders.

Specific \nenhancements that will benefit students include: \no Programs are constructed using concept-based teaching &\nlearning approaches, learner-centered education principles,\nrelationship-centered care and intentional clinical learning\nexperiences (deliberate practice)\no Major enhancements in amount and type of leadership courses\n(increasing from 1 leadership course to 4 courses), including a 9\ncredit senior clinical leadership practicum in the 4th year\no Specific focus on developing stress management and resiliency\nthrough the integration of formal evidence-based Mindfulness-\nBased Stress Reduction (MBSR) components and strategies for\nstudent success\no Clearer and closer connections between classroom, lab and\nclinical learning experiences (conceptually and timing of\nexperiences) – based on evidence and best practices\no Integration of a Community Service Learning course early in the\nprogram, and other opportunities to engage in clinical\nexperiences earlier in the programs (starting in 1st semester)\no Purposeful integration of healthcare informatics and technology\nthat reflects current and emerging practice in healthcare\no Inter-professional learning experiences embedded throughout the\nprogram in addition to a leadership course focused on the\napplication of Inter-professional healthcare competencies\no Integration of the Indigenous Health in Canada course – in\nresponse to the TRC recommendations for health disciplines\no Academic standing and admissions policies include a minimum\npass (C+) standard for key foundational courses that will ensure\nstudents have the knowledge necessary for success in higher\nlevel clinical courses\no Additional and enhanced clinical experiences (increased hours of\n1\nItem No. 5 \nGFC ACADEMIC PLANNING COMMITTEE \nFor the Meeting of October 25, 2017 \nclinical practice) as well as the use of a wider range of practice \nsettings that more accurately reflect the current and future \npractice settings of Registered Nurses \no Purposeful engagement with and integration of the programs of\nresearch of our faculty members ~ leveraging our strength as a\ntop ranked research Faculty to enhance our undergraduate\nstudent experience\nStarting Fall of 2018, the Undergraduate Nursing Programs will offer the \nnew courses and a new course sequence for all incoming students.  \nBecause of the significant enhancements and clear student benefits, we \nhave created a proposed cross-walk plan for students who entered our \nprograms in the Fall of 2017 to move into year two of the new programs \nin the Fall of 2018 so that they can also have the benefits of the program \nchanges for the remainder of their undergraduate education. \nReplaces/Revises (eg, policies, \nresolutions) \nTimeline/Implementation Date Fall 2018 \nEstimated Cost and funding \nsource \nN/A \nNext Steps (ie.: \nCommunications Plan, \nImplementation plans) \nA clear and comprehensive communication plan around this change for \ncurrent students has been developed and is ready to be implemented \nupon approval of this motion. The communication plan includes face to \nface sessions for all current 1st year nursing students about the cross-\nwalk, including Q&A in October 2017; arranging for 1:1 meetings \nbetween students and the student advisor or the director of \nundergraduate programs for all students who have additional questions \nor specific issues (through Oct. and Nov., 2017). We also plan to provide \nwritten communication about the details of the program enhancements \nand the cross-walk plans. A YouTube presentation that summarizes the \nenhancements and frequently asked questions will be available to all \nstudents.  \nOnce we have determined the number of students who may wish to opt-\nout of the cross-walk option, we will provide them with individual program \nmaps and undertake the necessary scheduling and planning to ensure \ntheir course sequence can be delivered. \nWe have already met with the RO in terms of planning and \nimplementation of the cross-walk plan.  The majority of courses are a 1:1 \nreplacement (equivalent course content and credits) and in these cases, \nthe calendar provision for course changes applies.  \nIn the case where there is a change in credit weighting and not direct \nequivalency, we would provide students the choice to opt-out of the new \ncourses and complete the previous course versions (or equivalent)/old \nsequence. \nThe faculty of nursing will continue with the development of course \ncontent, course outlines, schedules and course specific learning \nactivities.

Attachment 8: Proposed RPN-BScN Program Course Sequence\nPrepared by: Faculty of Nursing \n9\nAttachment 1 \nBackground: Proposed Nursing Undergraduate Program Changes \nThe Faculty of Nursing (FoN) historically has always had a strong belief in evaluating the \neffectiveness of their programs that has resulted in past major curriculum revisions, plus starting \nand ending programs. There was a significant change in 1991 when four other nursing \nprograms merged with the ones at the FoN. Three of the four sites were in Red Deer, Ft. \nMcMurray and Grande Prairie while the other program was at Grant MacEwan College in \nEdmonton. Since this was a momentous change, a formal evaluation strategy was \nimplemented. Evaluation questions were formulated, extra staff hired and information about the \nmergers and the context-based approach was disseminated widely at nursing conferences and \nthrough journal articles.  \nWith the introduction of the Provincial Nursing Education Program Approval Board (NEPAB) in \n2000, there has been a change with the formal ongoing programs evaluation process; the focus \nof evaluation is now on the requirements of the College & Association of Registered Nurses in \nAlberta (CARNA) Registered Nurses’ Entry to Practice Competencies. In addition to the CARNA \ncompetencies, in 2015, the Canadian Association of Schools of Nursing (CASN), our national \naccrediting body, released the National Nursing Education Framework.  Together, the CASN \nFramework and CARNA Competencies now form the foundation of the core program outcomes \nfor undergraduate nursing education in Alberta.  \nIn November 2012, an evaluation project was initiated using a standard evaluation method \n(Olson, Kushner, Ross, & Leung, 2014). It was called the FoN Undergraduate Nursing \nPrograms Review. The final report was published June 30, 2014. The investigators found only \n57.8 % of nursing students were satisfied to strongly satisfied with their program and 38.6% \nwere dissatisfied to strongly dissatisfied. Students also recommended they receive more \nprogram and student support. This report generated a great deal of discussion and interest \nwithin our faculty and coincided with our five-year strategic planning cycle, and the release of \nthe 2015 CASN Framework. In response to widespread faculty concerns around student \nsatisfaction and levels of support, in January 2016, the Dean of Nursing (Dr. Anita Molzahn) \nappointed Dr.’s Olive Yonge and Sandra Davidson as co-leads of a comprehensive curriculum \nrenewal project.  \nThe curriculum renewal project began with a comprehensive evaluation of the current programs \nusing a Developmental Evaluation (DE) framework (Patton, 2011, 2016). This approach is \nmarkedly different from the traditional evaluation used in 2012. When DE is used, this creates \nnear real time feedback to the administrators and participants of the programs. As \nadministrators receive the feedback, changes are made, resulting in continuous quality \nimprovement. DE is best suited for use in complex environments whereby there is uncertainty \nand no clear right answers. The purpose of the DE project is to work with all internal and \nexternal stakeholders to dynamically change, innovate and enhance the existing undergraduate \nnursing programs. The course and course sequence changes proposed have been developed \nbased on the DE data and recommendations generated from over 430 individual consultations. \nThe evaluators will continuously seek feedback on the response to recommendations and the \neffectiveness of solutions implemented. This cycle will continue for a minimum of 3 years. The \nfinal goal is to have student and staff satisfaction scores as close to 100 per cent as possible. \n10\n1 \nItem-6-att-2-Admission Requirements  \nFaculty of Nursing \nCalendar Change Request Form \nFor Implementation in 2018-19 \nUndergraduate Admission/ Admission Requirements by Faculty/ Faculty of Nursing/  \nCURRENT \nPROPOSED \nFaculty of Nursing Admission \nRequirements \nBSc in Nursing—Collaborative Program \nAdmission is competitive based on academic \nstanding. \nI.
