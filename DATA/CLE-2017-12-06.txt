She noted that the university holds one of the largest collections in the country and spoke to the standards required for these collections. Ms Andrews provided a couple of highlights of the report including the process by which things are brought in and removed from collections and the work being done on the return of human remains. Dr Hall spoke to the online availability of collections and the strategy to innovate online catalogue access. Discussion: The committee discussed access to the collections and it was noted that small group tours could be arranged. Ms Andrews noted that the collections are more research based than public facing. The committee also discussed how art work on public display is maintained/fixed, the access and awareness of what is available, moving collections and bringing people to collections, and the interdisciplinary work connections through curators. In response to the Chair’s question on how the committee could help, Ms Andrews indicated that Museums and Collections always needs ambassadors to promote the collections for teaching and research purposes, and the need for exhibition space, accessibility, and techinical expertise.",

She noted that Dr Weingarten brings a perspective from Ontario where the \ngovernment has mandated learning outcomes. \nDr Forgie reported on the survey experiential learning continues that looks at cataloguing current opportunities \nand asking what additional resources would be helpful. \nFinally, she reported on a blanket exercise that the Provost’s Office had participated in and asked if the \ncommittee would be interested in participating in such an event; links to such opportunities would be shared with \nthe committee. \nDISCUSSION ITEMS \n5. Proposed Student Groups Policy Suite  \nMaterials before members are contained in the official meeting file. \nPresenter(s): André Costopoulos, Vice-Provost and Dean of Students \nDiscussion: \nDean Costopoulos reported that the current procedure was approved when student groups were removed from \nthe Code of Student Behaviour a few years ago and that it has no associated policy. He indicated that proposed \npolicy suite would clarify the relationship between the university and student groups including whether the \nuniversity wants to have a relationship, the nature of relationship, and how it is regulated. Recognized student \ngroups have the privilege of booking space and using the university logo. Dean Costopoulos emphasized that \nthe proposed policy suite includes obligations on both sides and is primarily concerned with risk to people and \nproperty. \nThe committee discussed the time required for applications for student group events to be approved, that the \nStudents’ Union and Graduate Students’ Association would be bound by this policy, how situations which \ncontravene the policy or procedures would be handled, and risk to reputation.  \n6. University of Alberta Open Education  \nPresenter(s): Krysta McNutt, OER Project Manager, Centre for Teaching and Learning \nMs McNutt presented an overview of Open Education, defining the term and associated resources, providing \nperspectives on its use and referring to the University of Alberta OER awards. \nShe provided an overview on openly licensed education content and licensing and the ability of individuals to put \nrestrictions on how the resource is used by others. Ms McNutt indicated that assigning a license does not \nchange copyright. \nMs McNutt indicated that OER is used to reduce costs to students, increase the quality of teaching materials \nand opportunities for creative pedagogy, and make educational materials more accessible and discoverable. \nShe noted that students are asking for it and instructors already do it.  \nShe then gave the committee information about the University of Alberta OER Awards which would be \nannounced in mid-November; this grant program would connect faculty with CTL and Libraries, and provide \nsupport to instructors. \nDiscussion: \n4\nGFC Committee on the Learning Environment 11/01/2017 \nPage 3 \nMembers discussed the following: would university fund current websites which use OER, some of which are \nquite complex; concerns that resources are not peer reviewed; creation of new resources rather than using \nexisting resources; OER may not be suitable in all disciplines. \nOther issues raised included: content creators as stakeholders and how resources can be changed; accessibility \nrelated to device quality/access; importance of information literacy and necessity of critical thinking skills; how to \nrecognize and deal with content mistakes; the potential to use as a class activity to build and improve content; \nand the efforts made by the bookstore to keep textbook prices as low as possible.  \nEARLY CONSULTATION \n7. Experiential Learning (no documents)  \nPresenter(s): Sarah Forgie \nThe Chair noted that experiential learning is one of the themes in For the Public Good and indicated that Norma \nNocente and her team from CTL have been engaged to conduct an online survey and interviews to explore what \nis happening at the university. She indicated that this will be going forward to General Faculties Council for early \nconsultation and asked for the committee’s input. \nDiscussion: \nThe committee provided feedback that included: how is experiential learning defined, how it the term used in \ndifferent contexts, and how they would like to use it; the costs associated with it especially in light of budget \nreduction discussion; assessing supplementary fees to students to ensure quality experiences (hire staff to \nsupervise and ensure client safety as necessary); how experiential learning experiences can be compared \nbetween classes and programs; whether labs and design courses were considered to be experiential learning. \nOther comments included: reflection on why we do it, what we learned, and what was the educational benefit; \nthe need for continuing professional development for instructors; how to improve current experiences; evaluation \nof what is done well; and co-curricular opportunities.  \nDISCUSSION ITEMS \n8. Updates (no documents)  \n A. Centre for Teaching and Learning (CTL)   \nDr Miller Young provided an update on the learning outcomes resources guide on how to write and use \nlearning outcomes, and how to use them in evaluation. \n B. Information Technology – no update \nNo update \n C. Learning Services  \nDr DeLong reported that the Cameron Library was now open 24 hours and the safety and security of both \nstaff and students was being considered very seriously. She further noted that a staff member was hired \nto work with CTL on OER. \n D. General Faculties Council (GFC)  \n5\nGFC Committee on the Learning Environment 11/01/2017 \nPage 4 \nDr Lemaire noted that GFC approved at its last meeting: the CLE recommendations on USRIs, the first \nof the GFC committee terms of reference from ad hoc recommendations; changes of wording in the \nUniversity Calendar to Aboriginal identity from Aboriginal ancestry. \n9.

Teaching and Learning and Teaching Evaluation\nNote from the University Secretariat: The Post-Secondary Learning Act gives General Faculties Council (GFC)\nresponsibility, subject to the authority of the Board of Governors, over \"academic affairs\" (section 26(1)). GFC has\nthus established a Teaching and Learning and Teaching Evaluation policy as set out below.\nThe complete wording of the section(s) of the Post-Secondary Learning Act, as referred to above, and any other\nrelated sections, should be checked in any instance where formal jurisdiction or delegation needs to be determined.\n111.1 Teaching and Learning\nPreamble \nA university has at its heart two goals: the creation of knowledge, and the dissemination and preservation of\nknowledge. Research -- the creation of knowledge through exploration and discovery -- represents in its broadest\nsense the learning component of university life. The dissemination and preservation of that knowledge is the teaching\ncomponent. Within a university, what is taught and how it is taught depends upon research, and the impact of\nresearch depends upon its communication. This interdependence and integration of research and teaching is what\ndistinguishes a university from other educational institutions. Although the balance between these activities may vary,\nall members of the university, whether scholars or students, are learners who extend the range of their knowledge\nthrough exploration and discovery, and they are teachers who communicate that knowledge to others. (EXEC 01 MAY\n2000) (GFC 29 MAY 2000) \nThe context of teaching and learning at the University of Alberta \nThe University of Alberta is a large research-intensive university. Research and teaching, and the important bond\nbetween them, are central to our mission, and they are carried out in a multitude of disciplines. This context has\nsignificant implications for any discussion of support for teaching and learning.(EXEC 01 MAY 2000) (GFC 29 MAY\n2000) \nAs a research-intensive institution, the University of Alberta emphasizes the seamless relationship of scholarly\nactivities. More than simply recognizing that what we teach flows from the work of scholars, we are convinced that\npost-secondary and graduate curriculum development and delivery are best accomplished by dedicated researcher-\nteachers and scholar-teachers. We are committed to providing the best and most appropriate environments for\nstudent-instructor and student-student interaction.(EXEC 01 MAY 2000) (GFC 29 MAY 2000) \nWithin this context, graduate students serve a multifaceted role during their studies: as students, teachers,\nresearchers, mentors and grant or scholarship holders. The need to strike an appropriate balance among their\nresponsibilities gives graduate students a unique perspective in the university community, especially with respect to\nteaching. (EXEC 14 JAN 2002) (GFC 28 JAN 2002) \nThe University of Alberta is committed to developing the teaching expertise of graduate students. The involvement of\ngraduate students in the educational process is a vital and important resource for education and they make a\nsignificant contribution to the University?s mandate. The University recognizes the importance of the teaching of its\ngraduate students, in terms of participation in curriculum design and course development, didactic teaching, laboratory\ninstruction, class discussions, the provision of ongoing feedback, the preparation and assessment of assignments and\nexaminations and the evaluation of courses and instruction. (EXEC 14 JAN 2002)  \n(GFC 28 JAN 2002) 25\nhttp://www.gfcpolicymanual.ualberta.ca/\nThe University of Alberta is a multiversity. A wide range of disciplines is professed, various research models followed,\nand numerous types of teaching are required within its walls. There is no one teaching model, no one answer to serve\nall disciplines. Development of new teaching models should emphasize appropriate use, should be derived from within\nthe discipline concerned and the final arbiter should always be academic excellence.(EXEC 01 MAY 2000) (GFC 29 MAY\n2000) \nThe principles of good teaching/learning \nOur primary teaching roles are to educate students to the baccalaureate level, and to educate and mentor graduate\nstudents and post-doctoral scholars. The University of Alberta is also an intellectual resource for the general and\nprofessional community, and we make our faculty and courses available to that community.(EXEC 01 MAY 2000) (GFC\n29 MAY 2000) \nMost major University of Alberta documents of recent years discuss teaching from two points of view: strong\naffirmation of the University?s commitment to the importance and centrality of good teaching, and varying approaches\nto quality assurance in teaching. These two themes are consistent throughout the corpus of the staff agreement,\nstrategic planning documents, reports of student and faculty surveys, and official documents of various faculties.\nInterestingly enough, between these two poles of, on the one hand, asserting the importance of excellent teaching in\nthe University and, on the other, explicating a range of questions, opinions and policies about how to ensure teaching\nexcellence, there is a large and evident gap which only becomes clearly visible when the documents are scanned as a\ngroup: nowhere, in any document, is there a clear and complete statement of what constitutes excellent teaching. It is\ntaken for granted that we all know.(EXEC 01 MAY 2000) (GFC 29 MAY 2000) \nThe principles of good teaching that underlie all successful learning are applicable to all fields of study whether the arts\nor the sciences, whether pure or applied. They apply equally for all modes of instruction whether didactic or self\ndirected approaches are used and whether a blackboard and chalk, hands-on demonstration or the most sophisticated\ntechnologies support instruction. They apply for all students whether undergraduate or graduate, whether on-campus\nor at a distance. Four such principles are intrinsic to effective teaching and learning.(EXEC 01 MAY 2000) (GFC 29 MAY\n2000) \nI. The teacher is a scholar who has, and can share with the student, a rich knowledge of the discipline and its place in\nthe larger intellectual community. In his 1990 book Scholarship Reconsidered, Ernest Boyer characterizes four sorts of\nscholarship: teaching, integration, application and discovery. The scholarship of teaching means a professor is widely\nread, intellectually engaged, and has the ability to transmit, transform and extend knowledge. The scholarship of\nintegration means that a professor can interpret and draw together insights within and between disciplines and fit\nthose insights into larger intellectual patterns. The scholarship of application enriches teaching and intellectual\nunderstanding through the very act of application. The scholarship of discovery, which includes creative work in the\nvisual, literary and performing arts, may engage the professor and student together in increasing the stock of human\nknowledge and adding to the intellectual climate of the institution. The sort of intellectual engagement implied by\nthese scholarships is essential to good university teaching. It leads the student well beyond the acquisition of a body of\nknowledge and into the domain of active learning, curiosity, and insight.(EXEC 01 MAY 2000) (GFC 29 MAY 2000) \nMoreover, teachers actively reflect upon, measure and innovate in their teaching practice. Teaching is both an art and\na science. As an art, it progresses through critical review, study of masters, public documentation and celebration and\ncontinuous innovation. Like other sciences, teaching advances through development of theory, careful measurement\nand research design, continuing reflection and peer review and replication of findings.(EXEC 01 MAY 2000) (GFC 29\nMAY 2000) \nII. The teacher engages the mind of the student. This is perhaps the most difficult of the principles of teaching/learning\nto characterize. What is it that engages the student?s mind with the topic, the instructor, and the process of learning?\n26\nIs it the passion of the instructor for the field of study, and his/her evident enjoyment in sharing it with the student? Is\nit the stimulus of curiosity cleverly awakened? Is it the glimpse through the mind of the scholar/teacher of the\nimportance of the topic of study to that wider intellectual community? Is it the sense of accomplishment -- of the self\nempowered --gained by responding successfully to and beyond a teacher?s expectations? However it happens, it is\nrooted in the relationship between the teacher and the student, and it is essential to effective learning. (EXEC 01 MAY\n2000) (GFC 29 MAY 2000) \nIII. The teacher respects the student and the student respects the teacher. We expect students will respect their\nteachers; it is surely a given. As teachers, we try to earn that respect by the way we conduct ourselves. But it is just\nas important, and perhaps not as much of a given, that teachers should respect their students. We must respect the\nstate of their knowledge when they come to us. We must respect their goals for their study with us, even as we try to\nwiden them. We must respect the circumstances of their lives -- work, other courses, family responsibilities. We must\nrespect the fact they learn in different ways, at different rates, and eventually, to different levels. We must respect\ntheir ideas, their aspirations, their beliefs. We must make it evident we respect and value them as individuals if we are\nto be successful in engaging their minds.(EXEC 01 MAY 2000) (GFC 29 MAY 2000) \nIV. The teacher ensures a good climate for learning. A good climate for learning starts with the institutional provision\nfor the basic physical comfort of good lighting, heating, and ventilation, and the assurance all students can hear and\nsee what they need to hear and see. It extends to such other organizational matters as having learning materials\navailable on time, as needed, and without frustration; schedules announced and kept; appropriate assessment, and\nefficient and effective feedback. But above and beyond these matters, a good climate for learning is a climate in which\nthe student is at ease with the teacher and with others in the class, and can risk questions and ideas safe in the\nknowledge that they will be welcomed, respected, and answered. In such a climate, the student can feel like a\ncontributor rather than a consumer. In such a climate, engagement of the mind and intellectual growth can occur.\n(EXEC 01 MAY 2000) (GFC 29 MAY 2000) \nWhat must students bring to the University teaching and learning environment? \nTo fully participate in and benefit from the teaching and learning programs at the University of Alberta, entering\nstudents are expected to arrive with a set of attitudes and skills that prepares them for academic study. These will be\nexpanded and grow through participation in University community.(EXEC 01 MAY 2000) (GFC 29 MAY 2000) \nThese attributes/skills include: \n- motivation to participate in an active learning community that challenges and stimulates intellectual, scholarly,\npersonal and interpersonal growth \n- a willingness to take a major responsibility for one's own learning \n- curiosity about the discipline of specialization and the integration of specialized knowledge with other disciplines and\nin society \n- tolerance and appreciation for diversity and multiple viewpoints \n- a sense of responsibility and respect for self and other members of the university community \n- oral and written competency in English or French, mathematical and reasoning skills, competent use of appropriate\ninformation and communication technologies \n- respect and adherence to the ethical standards of scholarship including abhorrence of plagiarism, false representation\nand cheating (EXEC 01 MAY 2000) (GFC 29 MAY 2000) \n27\nWhat outcomes should be expected from a program of undergraduate study at the University of Alberta? \nGeneric outcomes include: \n- critical thinking skills \n- communication skills including oral, written and group work skills \n- the ability to learn independently \n- the motivation and ability to use personal, creative and entrepreneurial talents \n- an informed understanding of and a desire to participate in the intellectual, cultural, social and political life of local,\nnational and global communities \nSpecialized outcomes include: \n- the ability to synthesize the core content in a disciplinary or professional field of study \n- knowledge of some of the \"big questions\" in the field \n- the skills to effectively find, synthesize and apply information in the relevant literature \n- knowledge of and the ability to use the investigative and observational methods of the field \n- interest in and an excitement for some aspect of the specialized field of study \n- understanding of the relevance and application of the specialized field of study to every day life. (EXEC 01 MAY 2000)\n(GFC 29 MAY 2000) \nIf we are successful in helping students develop these attributes and skills we will have both disseminated and\npreserved the products of our scholarship and prepared them to apply the knowledge of their field in employment or to\nextend that knowledge through professional programs, graduate studies or continuing education. (EXEC 01 MAY 2000)\n(GFC 29 MAY 2000)\n111.2 Teaching Evaluation\n1. Evaluation of teaching at the University of Alberta serves two purposes: \na. Summative - Evaluation provides a review and overview of an instructor's teaching that is an essential element in\npromotion and tenure decisions. In its summative form, teaching evaluation forms a basis for rewarding excellence, as\nwell as the basis for withholding reward. (GFC 24 NOV 1997) \nb. Formative - Evaluation provides helpful feedback to teachers by identifying teaching strengths and weaknesses and,\nin so doing, giving guidance for the improvement or refinement of teaching skills. (GFC 24 NOV 1997) \n2. Evaluation of teaching shall be multifaceted. Multifaceted evaluation shall include the Universal Student Ratings of\nInstruction set out in Section 111.3 and other methods of assessing teaching designed within the individual Faculties to\nrespond to the particular conditions of that Faculty. Such assessments shall include one or more of the following: input\nfrom administrators, peers, self, undergraduate and graduate students, and alumni. (GFC 09 JUN 1995) (GFC 24 NOV\n1997) \n28\n3. Recognizing that the evaluation of teaching at the University shall be multifaceted, Faculty Evaluation Committee\n(FEC) decisions concerning tenure, promotion or unsatisfactory teaching performance must be based on more than one\nindicator of the adequacy of teaching. (GFC 24 NOV 1997) \n4. Assessment of teaching involving input from administrators, peers, self, alumni, or undergraduate and graduate\nstudents in addition to the Universal Student Ratings of Instruction should occur annually prior to tenure. For\ncontinuing faculty (ie, Categories A1.1, A1.5 and A1.6), such assessment will occur at least triennially. (GFC 24 NOV\n1997) \n5. The University shall continue to support University Teaching Services in its education programming which is focused\non the development and improvement of teaching and learning and its efforts to enhance research in university\nteaching. (GFC 28 APR 1980) (GFC 26 SEP 1988) (GFC 12 OCT 1993) (GFC 24 NOV 1997)\n111.3 Universal Student Ratings of Instruction\nIn recognition of the University's commitment to teaching, the General Faculties Council endorses a system of\nUniversal Student Ratings of Instruction. This system, however, is only one part of the multi-faceted approach\ndescribed in Section 111.2. (GFC 09 JUN 1995) (GFC 24 NOV 1997) (EXEC 29 MAR 1999)\nThe Universal Student Ratings of Instruction are administered electronically via a system known as the eUSRI system. \n(GFC 22 SEP 2014)\nThe Universal Student Ratings of Instruction are designed to provide a minimal university-wide base of information on\nstudent ratings to the parties listed in this Section. With this purpose in mind, the General Faculties Council adopts the\nfollowing policies: (GFC 24 NOV 1997)\nA. All Faculties will ensure that evaluation of all instructors and courses will take place each time a course is offered.\nThe term 'instructors' is meant to include tenured professors, tenure-track professors, sessional instructors, clinical\ninstructors, field supervisors and graduate teaching assistants with responsibilities for courses. The term 'course' is\nmeant to include undergraduate and graduate courses, laboratory courses, non-degree courses, seminars, clinical\nsupervision courses, and reading or directed study courses. With the exceptions noted in Section 111.3.B, the\nassessment will include the Universal Student Ratings of Instruction as set out below.\nB. The Universal Student Ratings of Instruction will be modified in the following circumstances:\ni. courses with between four and nine registered students will use a department or Faculty developed questionnaire,\nwhich may be administered via the eUSRI system, with non-scored questions, such as:\na) comments on the quality of this course;  \nb) suggestions for improving this course;  \nc) comments on the quality of instruction in this course;  \nd) suggestions for improving the instruction in this course. (EXEC 29 MAR 1999) (GFC 22 SEP 2014)\nii. courses with multiple instructors will use a modified Universal Student Ratings of Instruction questionnaire that will\ninclude one set of course-related questions for the entire course and one set of instructor-related questions for each\ninstructor who has taught the equivalent of twenty percent or more of the course. If no instructor is responsible for at\nleast twenty percent of the course, only course-related questions should be used on the questionnaire. (EXEC 29 MAR\n1999)\niii. in courses with fewer than four registered students or courses such as alternate delivery style courses, the Chair,\nDirector or Dean will arrange for an alternate method of obtaining student feedback. Such methods could include\nstudent course or program exit interviews with the Chair, Director or Dean; or a department or Faculty developed\nquestionnaire, which may be administered via the eUSRI system, with non-scored questions as described in point i.\nabove. (EXEC 29 MAR 1999) (GFC 22 SEP 2014)\n29\nC. The Universal Student Ratings of Instruction will take the form of a questionnaire. The following statement of\npurpose will be included at the beginning of the questionnaire:\nThe University of Alberta would appreciate your careful completion of this questionnaire. The results help instructors\nand departments or faculties to initiate constructive change in curriculum and instruction. In addition, the results are\none important factor in decisions affecting the career of your instructor. The numerical summaries for the ten\nquestions listed below are available through the Students' Union and the Graduate Students' Association.\nThe eUSRI system will be accessible only by CCID and students' anonymity will be protected.  Students who are\nconcerned about the anonymity of their responses should submit their typewritten comments within the period for\nwhich eUSRI is available to the Chair, Director or Dean , making sure to note the course number, section and name of\nthe instructor. (GFC 24 NOV 1997) (GFC 22 SEP 2014)\nQuestions about this questionnaire should be addressed to your Chair, Director or Dean.\nD. The anonymity of student responses to the Universal Student Ratings of Instruction is of fundamental importance in\nmaintaining student confidentiality and encouraging the free expression of views. Under normal circumstances, the\nanonymity of students will be protected. Universal Student Ratings of Instruction offer an avenue of feedback,\nincluding feedback critical of instructors. It is understood that it is a normal feature of criticism that it may be regarded\nas offensive and/or unjustified, and that such characteristics would not justify a departure from the normal rules\npertaining to confidentiality and anonymity. (GFC 28 FEB 2000)\nHowever, the University has a parallel duty to protect the safety (physical or mental) of members of the University\ncommunity. If a Department Chair has concerns for the safety of faculty, staff or students, arising from statements\nthat are part of a Universal Student Rating of Instruction, the Chair will consult with the Dean of the Faculty. If the\nDean believes that there is a valid concern for safety, he or she may recommend to the Provost and Vice-President\n(Academic) that the identity of the author of the statements be sought out and disclosed to the appropriate University\nofficials. At any time during this process, the Chair or Dean may invoke the Protocol for Urgent Cases of Disruptive,\nThreatening or Violent Conduct (Section 91.3, GFC Policy Manual). (GFC 28 FEB 2000)\nOn receiving such a request from a Dean, the Provost and Vice-President (Academic) will follow the terms of the\nProtocol for Urgent Cases of Disruptive, Threatening or violent conduct in determining whether there is\ni. reasonable cause to believe that the safety or security (including significant psychological harm) of persons may be\nthreatened and\nii. that under existing University policies, the statements are grounds for disciplinary action and hence whether\nconfidentiality of USRI should be breached and the provisions in Section 91.3.2 and/or 91.3.3 of the Protocol invoked.\n(GFC 28 FEB 2000)\nIf the identity of the author is disclosed, the Provost and  Vice-President (Academic) will notify the author of the\nstatements. The Provost and Vice-President (Academic) will also notify any individuals mentioned in the statements.\n(GFC 28 FEB 2000)\nE. The Universal Student Ratings of Instruction questionnaire will use the rating scale\nStrongly Disagree, Disagree, Neutral, Agree, Strongly Agree  (EXEC 29 MAR 1999)\nto gather responses to the following questions:\n1. The goals and objectives of the course were clear.  \n2. In-class time was used effectively.  \n3. I am motivated to learn more about these subject areas.  \n4. I increased my knowledge of the subject areas in this course.  \n5. Overall the quality of the course content was excellent. \n6. The instructor spoke clearly. \n30\n7. The instructor was well prepared. \n8. The instructor treated the students with respect. \n9. The instructor provided constructive feedback throughout this course. \n10. Overall, this instructor was excellent. (EXEC 29 MAR 1999)\nThese constitute the ten required Universal Student Ratings of Instruction questions. Instructors, departments, and\nfaculties are encouraged to supplement the set of universal questions.\nThe questionnaire will include an opportunity to provide comments. (GFC 22 SEP 2014)\nF. Certain policies are necessary in order to ensure that the Universal Student Ratings of Instruction Questionnaire is\nadministered in as consistent a fashion as possible. These are:\ni. Access to the electronic Universal Student Ratings of Instruction will normally be available from the day after the\nwithdrawal deadline until the last day of classes.  Note that an instructor may choose to allow class time for completion\nof the questionnaires.  In these cases, the instructor will not be present in the room during the time allotted for\ncompletion of the questionnaire.  Departments or Faculties will create policies to ensure that other individuals (e.g.\nother instructors, students within the class, teaching assistants) are available to be present in the room during the\ntime allotted for completion of the questionnaire.  Also in these cases, online access for completion of the\nquestionnaires will still be available for the period described above.  (GFC 22 SEP 2014)\nii. The Chair or delegate will be responsible for transmission of results and comments to the instructor under the\nconditions set out in Section G.  (GFC 22 SEP 2014)\nG. The numerical summaries for the ten Universal Student Ratings of Instruction questions will be reported to the\ninstructor, the Chair, Director or Dean and students.\ni. the number of students responding in each category;\nii. the median score to one decimal point for the question; and\niii. numerical values from Tukey's boxplot statistics will be provided to describe the distribution of scores in the\nFaculty/Department:\na. lower cut-off for outlier scores  \nb. lower hinge (25th percentile) \nc. median  \nd. upper hinge (75th percentile) \ne. it is expected that the upper cut-off will always be 5.0 and, therefore, unnecessary to report.  (EXEC 29 MAR 1999)\nNote: Statistics from Tukey's box-and-whisker plot analysis (John W. Tukey, Exploratory Data Analysis, Addison-\nWesley Publishing Company, Inc. 1977) have been selected to describe the distribution of USRI data. These statistics\nare chosen to achieve two main objectives: (i) summarizing skewed data and (ii) identifying outliers from the general\npopulation if they exist.\nThe median (middle of a ranked set of numbers) is generally preferred rather than the mean in defining the centre of a\nskewed data set.\nThe 25th and 75th percentiles provide information about the spread of individual scores around the median. By\ndefinition, half of the scores in a distribution are below the median and 25 percent of the scores are below the 25th\npercentile. Since this occurs \"by definition\", these values should not be used to determine whether a particular score is\n\"good\" or \"bad\".\nThe lower whisker or cut-off, which is 1.5 box lengths below the 25th percentile (box length is the distance from the\n25th to the 75th percentile), defines a reasonable limit beyond which any score can be considered an outlier. Outliers\n31\nare scores that identify ratings of instruction falling outside the usual distribution of the scores for the population being\ntabulated.\nGiven the nature of the USRI data, the upper whisker or cut-off (1.5 box lengths above the 75th percentile) will usually\nbe above 5.0, and so need not be reported.\nH. \ni.  Access to USRI Data:  Parties having access to numerical summaries of the ten Universal Student Ratings of\nInstruction questions and student comments will be the instructor the Chair, Director or Dean of the unit offering the\ncourse; members of Tenure Committees; and members of Faculty Evaluation Committees, including the secretary to\nthe FEC. (EXEC 07 NOV 2011) (GFC 22 SEP 2014)\nFor questions selected by an instructor, only the instructor will receive the results. For questions initiated or mandated\nby a department or Faculty, the results will be reported to the instructor and the Chair, Director or Dean.\nNormally, instructors will receive the results from the student ratings of instruction within twenty working days after\nthe course is complete and the grade sheet has been signed by the Chair, Director or Dean. (EXEC 29 MAR 1999)\n(EXEC 07 NOV 2011)\nii.  Access to Online USRI Data: Online access to the numerical summaries for the ten Universal Student Ratings of\nInstruction questions scores for all courses will be provided to undergraduate and graduate students.  Instructors will\nhave online access to USRI scores for their own courses.  Chairs will have online access to USRI scores for instructors\nin their departments and Deans will have online access to USRI scores for instructors in their Faculties.  Deans and\nChairs may also request access for a designated assistant. (EXEC 07 NOV 2011)\nThe results will not be released online for at least ten days following the provision of the results to the instructor. \n(EXEC 07 NOV 2011)\nAccess to online USRI data is provided to students only for the purpose of assisting with the selection of courses. \nNeither the Students' Union nor the Graduate Students' Association will undertake analysis of USRI data available to\nmembers of those organizations.  (EXEC 07 NOV 2011)\nI. All results given out to students, Chairs, Directors and Deans will have the following cautionary preface:\nStudent questionnaires form an important part of evaluating teaching effectiveness but cannot be taken alone as a\ncomplete assessment of an instructor or course. Factors other than an instructor's teaching ability may influence\nratings. These factors include class size, class level, Faculty, time of class, required versus optional course, grade\nexpectations, student GPA, gender, race, ethnicity, age of both students and instructors.\nSmall differences in evaluation should not be considered meaningful. Scores will be interpreted using the rating scale\ndefined in 111.3 (E): 1=Strongly Disagree; 2=Disagree; 3=Neutral; 4=Agree; 5=Strongly Agree.  By definition, a\nscore of 4.0 means that students agree that \"Overall, the instructor was excellent.\" (GFC 22 SEP 2014)\nJ. Nothing in this section will prevent instructors from seeking other means of feedback from students during the term.\nK. The central administration of the University will undertake the financing and operation of the eUSRI system in\nsupport of the University's commitment to teaching. (GFC 22 SEP 2014)\n111.4 Graduate Student Teaching Awards\nAt its meeting of May 3, 2010, the GFC Executive Committee approved, under delegated authority from General\nFaculties Council (GFC), proposed revisions to the Awards for Teaching Excellence Policy (in UAPPOL); the proposed\n(new) Graduate Student Teaching Award Procedure (in UAPPOL); and the concurrent rescission of Section 111.4\n(Graduate Student Teaching Awards) of the GFC Policy Manual, all to take effect upon final approval.\nGraduate Student Teaching Award Procedure\n32\n33\n\tItem-1-Agenda\n\tItem-2-Minutes\n\tItem-4-Museums-Annual-Report\n\tUniversity of Alberta Museums Annual Report 2016-2017  Approved Nov 22\n\tItem-5-GFC-Policy-111\n\tGFC Policy 111\n",
