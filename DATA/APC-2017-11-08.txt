Proposal for substantive revisions to the curriculum of the Master of Public Health (MPH) in the School of \nPublic Health, Faculty of Graduate Studies & Research  \nMaterials before members are contained in the official meeting file. \nGFC Academic Planning Committee 10/25/2017 \nPage 2 \nPresenter(s): Deborah Burshtyn, Associate Dean, Faculty of Graduate Studies and Research (FGSR); Jeffrey \nJohnson, Associate Dean, Education, School of Public Health; Ruth Wolf, Practicum Program Director, School \nof Public Health \nPurpose of the Proposal:  The proposed calendar changes represent a restructuring of the core curricula across \nall seven of our current MPH degree programs. This involves a replacement of the current common core \ncourses required for all MPH degree programs with a set of newly developed common core courses, and \nconsequent revision of specialization requirements.  \nDiscussion: \nDr Burshtyn noted that this proposal represents an overhaul for the program requirements for second level \nspecializations in the Master of Public Health and that it is structured around outcomes and competencies.  She \nalso noted that this is a good example of how  \nDr Johnson noted that the redesign allows for a common core curriculum for all of the second level \nspecializations that integrates these specializations and provides more interdisciplinary training.  The program \naims to prepare public health practitioners for a clinical environment. Dr Wolfe confirmed that equity and social \njustice are core values in public health and that Aboriginal health and marginal populations would be included in \nthe courses.  \nDuring the discussion, the importance of indigenous health was acknowledged and was being integrated into the \ncore courses currently in development. \nMembers expressed additional questions in relation to fees, terms, and the removal of certain courses in the \nredesign. It was also noted that the proposal represents a good example of program design. \nMotion:  Acker/Campbell \nTHAT the GFC Academic Planning Committee approve, under delegated authority from General Faculties \nCouncil, the proposal for revisions to the curriculum of the Master of Public Health (MPH) in the School of Public \nHealth as proposed by the Faculty of Graduate Studies & Research, and as set forth in Attachment 1, to be \neffective for admissions to Fall 2018. \nCARRIED \n5. Proposal for Substantive Changes to the Undergraduate Nursing Curriculum, Faculty of Nursing  \nMaterials before members are contained in the official meeting file. \nPresenter(s): Greta Cummings, Dean, Faculty of Nursing; Olive Yonge, Vice-Dean; Faculty of Nursing; Sandra \nDavidson, Associate Dean (Undergraduate Programs), Faculty of Nursing \nPurpose of the Proposal: To discuss and approve substantive changes to the Undergraduate Nursing program, \nthe proposed transition plans (cross-walks), and the associated admissions and academic standing calendar \nchanges for these program changes. \nDiscussion: \nDean Cummings reported that this proposal represents two years of planning and extensive development \nculminating in over one hundred recommendations for the new curriculum. \nDr Davidson provided an overview to the committee noting that the changes are student-focused and meet the \nCanadian Association of Schools of Nursing (CASN) accreditation standards and comply with competencies \nGFC Academic Planning Committee 10/25/2017 \nPage 3 \nrequired by the College and Association of Registered Nurses of Alberta (CARNA).  Dr Davidson explained that \nthe new program aims to develop nurse leaders who can facilitate change in a clinical setting. \nDr Yonge explained that a cross-walk program has been developed for students who entered the program in the \nfall of 2017 which will allow them to move into year two of the new programs in the fall of 2018. \nMembers, during the discussion, commended the presenters for their inclusion of indigenous health. \nMembers sought clarification regarding the length of the program, the changes to academic performance, and a \nmember suggested an editorial amendment to the calendar wording in the proposal. \nMotion:  Glanfield/Hamilton \nTHAT the GFC Academic Planning Committee approve, with delegated authority from General Faculties \nCouncil, proposed changes to the Undergraduate Nursing Curriculum, as proposed by the Faculty of Nursing, \nand as set forth in Attachment 1, to take effect Fall 2018. \nCARRIED \nDISCUSSION ITEMS \n6. Learning Moment: Program Budgets contained in Academic Program Proposals  \nMaterials before members are contained in the official meeting file. \nPresenter(s): Chad Schulz, Director, Integrated Finance Services; Edith Finczak, Director, Academic Budget & \nPlanning; Tammy Hopper, Vice-Provost (Programs) \nPurpose of the Proposal: To brief the GFC Academic Planning Committee on how program budgets are being \ndrafted to satisfy the requirements of the Ministry of Advanced Education for proposed degree, certificate and \ndiploma programs. \nDiscussion: \nDr Hopper reported that the Ministry of Advanced Education has revised their program templates to include a \ndetailed budget section and is requesting more information about program-level budgets. She noted that the \nProvost Office is working with units to develop this information as the university does not allocate funding or \ntrack expenditure at the program level. Ms Finczak reviewed the methodology utilized to develop program-level \nbudgets and the assumptions made. \nMembers discussed direct and indirect costs, the challenges in allocating faculty time to a specific program, how \nto distinguish research and teaching activities, and service teaching. A member stated that this data should not \nbe used as hard evidence of revenues and costs. \nThe Chair clarified that this formula is not being used to make internal institutional budget decisions and that \ngovernment reviews this information through a program lens as opposed to a departmental one. \n7. Proposed Changes to the GFC Academic Planning Committee (APC) Terms of Reference  \nMaterials before members are contained in the official meeting file. \nPresenter(s): Steven Dew, Chair, and Provost and Vice-President (Academic) \nGFC Academic Planning Committee 10/25/2017 \nPage 4 \nPurpose of the Proposal: To discuss amendments to the GFC Academic Planning Committee (APC) terms of \nreference. \nDiscussion: \nThe Chair led members through the current committee terms of reference. A member suggested that the Deputy \nProvost should be added as a non-voting member. While it was noted that the Deputy Provost can attend as the \nProvost’s delegate, there was general agreement by the committee that the Deputy Provost could be a non-\nvoting member.  \nIt was noted that information technology was missing from governance, even though IT impacts research, \nteaching and other scholarly activities.  The Chair indicated that there are administrative committees that \ndiscuss IT governance and that further clarity on this item would be developed and brought back to members for \nfurther discussion. \nDuring the discussion on the proposed move of college programming from APC to the GFC Academic \nStandards Committee (ASC), it was noted that more consultation with the Dean of Faculté Saint-Jean was \nneeded. \nDuring the discussion, members enquired about the role of the member appointed by Chairs’ Council, the \ndifference between administrative committees and governance committees, APC’s role in quality assurance, the \nterm “school”, and the manner in which fees and new fees are routed through governance.  \nThe Chair reported that this item would be included on future agendas for further discussion. \n8. Update on the Budget  \nThere were no documents. \nPresenter(s): Steven Dew, Chair, and Provost and Vice-President (Academic) \nPurpose of the Proposal:  For information/discussion. \nDiscussion: \nThe Chair reported on the recent announcement of an anticipated 4% reduction in base budget allocations for \n2018-19 followed by projected 2.5% reductions for both 2019-20 and 2020-21.  This is based on assumptions of \nno increase to the Campus Alberta Grant or tuition.  Members discussed specific program cuts rather than \nacross-the-board cuts as well as the impacts of this on Faculties. \nThe Chair noted the current structural deficit, previous reliance on investment income for base funds, and cost \nchallenges related to external contracts, minimum wage changes, and exchange rates. He also discussed the \nplanning framework, the budget model, and multi-year forecasting. The Chair noted that there would be a town \nhall on the planning framework on November 9 and that there would be further discussion on this item at the \nNovember 8 meeting of APC. \n9. Question Period  \nThere were no questions. \nINFORMATION REPORTS \n10.

These are offered through the \nDepartment of Art and Design in the Faculty of Arts. This proposal is to \nadd a course-based MA in the History of Art, Design and Visual Culture \nto our offerings. \nThe Impact of the Proposal is The new degree will offer a flexible graduate degree option for students, \nartists, community members, and teachers who have completed a \nBachelor’s degree in the history of art or a related discipline. It will also \nbe of use to students who have completed other graduate programs, \nsuch as the Master of Fine Arts (MFA). \nReplaces/Revises (eg, policies, \nresolutions) \nN/A \nTimeline/Implementation Date September 2019 \nEstimated Cost and funding \nsource \nResources which are currently being used to deliver courses to the \nthesis-based MA students will now be used to fund courses taken by \nboth thesis and course-based MA students. This new option will bring \ncosts down and more students will be served because the course-based \nMA students will be added to already existing courses taken by thesis-\nbased MA students. \nNext Steps (ie.: \nCommunications Plan, \nImplementation plans) \nSupplementary Notes and \ncontext \nThe new degree will offer a flexible degree option for students, artists, \ncommunity members, and teachers who have completed a Bachelor’s \ndegree in the history of art or a related discipline. It will also be of use to \nstudents who have completed other graduate programs, such as the \nItem No. 4 \nGFC ACADEMIC PLANNING COMMITTEE \nFor the Meeting of November 8, 2017 \nMaster of Fine Arts (MFA).  \nThe degree is designed to allow completion in one year, although it may \nalso be completed part time over a longer period of time. Except for the \ncapstone, which will be available as independent study, it makes use of \ncourses that are already in place and regularly offered. They will pay the \nstandard course-based graduate tuition; there will be no extra costs. \nThe course-based MA differs from the thesis-based MA (preparing for \nPhD work and research careers) in that it will be preparing students for \nprofessional and managerial careers in the arts. \nEngagement and Routing (Include meeting dates) \nParticipation: \n(parties who have seen the \nproposal and in what capacity) \n<For further information see \nthe link posted on \nthe Governance Toolkit section \nStudent Participation Protocol> \nThose who have been informed: \n• All current graduate students in HADVC   \n• All faculty members in Art & Design \nThose who have been consulted: \n• Dr. Kathryn Shailer, Acting Research Officer and Special Advisor \nfor Graduate Studies and \n• Internationalization, Alberta College of Art and Design \n• Dr. Kenneth Allen, Associate Professor of Art History, University \nof Lethbridge \n• Dr Anne Dymond, Associate Professor, Art History and Museum \nStudies, University of Lethbridge \n• Dr. Allan Gilliland, Dean, Faculty of Fine Arts, MacEwan \nUniversity \n• Dean Smale, Coordinator of Visual Communications, Medicine \nHat College \n• Jason Frizzell, Dean, School of Creative Arts, Red Deer College \n• Jia Wang, Acting Director, China Institute, University of Alberta \n• Dr. Randolph Wimmer, Interim Dean, Faculty of Education, \nUniversity of Alberta \n• Faculty of Graduate Studies and Research (FGSR): Deborah \nBurshtyn, Vice Dean and Janice Hurlburt Graduate Governance \nand Policy Coordinator \n• Vice - Provost (Programs) Tammy Hopper and Portfolio Initiatives \nManager, Office of the Provost and Vice-President (Academic) \nKate Peters \n• Edith Finczak, Director, Academic Budgeting and Programming \n• Dr Bryan Hogeveen, Associate Dean, FGSR \n• Dr Thomas Spalding, Associate Dean (Graduate Studies), \nFaculty of Arts  \n• Rose Yu, Director, Strategy, Initiatives, Facilities and Finance in \nthe Faculty of Arts \n• Faculty of Arts (Arts Academic, Arts Executive, and Arts Faculty \nCouncil \nThose who are actively participating: \n• All faculty members in HADVC \n• Elizabeth (Betsy) Boone, Professor, History of Art, Design, and \nVisual Culture, Department of Art and Design \nhttp://www.governance.ualberta.ca/GovernanceToolkit/Toolkit.aspx\nhttp://www.governance.ualberta.ca/GovernanceToolkit/Toolkit.aspx\nItem No. 4 \nGFC ACADEMIC PLANNING COMMITTEE \nFor the Meeting of November 8, 2017 \nApproval Route (Governance) \n(including meeting dates) \nFaculty of Arts Executive – May 11, 2017 \nArts Faculty Council – May 25, 2017 \nGFC ASC Subcommittee on Standards – October 5, 2017 \nGFC Academic Standards Committee – October 19, 2017 \nGFC Academic Planning Committee – November 8, 2017 \nFinal Approver GFC Academic Standards Committee (Admission/Transfer and \nAcademic Standing) \nGFC Academic Planning Committee \nAlignment/Compliance \nAlignment with Guiding \nDocuments \nInstitutional Strategic Plan - For the Public Good \nEXCEL \nGOAL: Excel as individuals, and together, sustain a culture that fosters \nand champions distinction and distinctiveness in teaching, learning, \nresearch, and service. \nOBJECTIVE 14: Inspire, model, and support excellence in teaching and \nlearning. i) Foster, encourage, and support innovation and \nexperimentation in curriculum development, teaching, and learning at the \nindividual, unit, and institutional levels. \nENGAGE \nGOAL: Engage communities across our campuses, city and region, \nprovince, nation and the world to create reciprocal, mutually beneficial \nlearning experiences, research projects, partnerships, and \ncollaborations.   \nCompliance with Legislation, \nPolicy and/or Procedure \nRelevant to the Proposal \n(please quote legislation and \ninclude identifying section \nnumbers) \n1. Post-Secondary Learning Act (PSLA): The PSLA gives GFC \nresponsibility, subject to the authority of the Board of Governors, over \nacademic affairs (Section 26(1)). Further, the PSLA gives the Board of \nGovernors authority over certain admission requirements and rules \nrespecting enrolment (Section 60(1)(c) and (d)). The Board has \ndelegated its authority over admissions requirements and rules \nrespecting enrolment to GFC. GFC has thus established an Academic \nStandards Committee (ASC). \n2. PSLA: GFC may make recommendations to the Board of Governors \non a number of matters including the budget and academic planning \n(Section 26(1)(o)). GFC delegates its power to recommend to the Board \non the budget and on new or revised academic programs to the GFC \nAcademic Planning Committee (APC). \n3. PSLA: The PSLA gives Faculty Councils power to “provide for the \nadmission of students to the faculty” (29(1)(c)). \n4. PSLA: The PSLA gives Faculty Councils the authority to “determine \nthe programs of study for which the faculty is established” (Section \n29(1)(a)); to “provide for the admission of students to the faculty” \n(Section 29(1)(c)); and to “determine the conditions under which a \nstudent must withdraw from or may continue the student’s program of \nstudies in a faculty” (Section 29(1)(d)). \n5. UAPPOL Admissions Policy: “Admission to the University of Alberta \nis based on documented academic criteria established by individual \nFaculties and approved by GFC. These criteria may be defined in areas \nItem No. 4 \nGFC ACADEMIC PLANNING COMMITTEE \nFor the Meeting of November 8, 2017 \nsuch as subject requirements, minimum entrance averages, and \nlanguage proficiency requirements. In addition to academic requirements \nfor admission, GFC authorizes each Faculty to establish such other \nreasonable criteria for admission of applicants as the Faculty may \nconsider appropriate to its programs of study, subject to the approval of \nGFC (e.g. interview, audition, portfolio, etc.) \nThe admission requirements for any Faculty will be those approved by \nGFC as set forth in the current edition of the University Calendar. In \naddition to the admission requirements, selection criteria for quota \nprograms, where they exist, will also be published in the current edition \nof the University Calendar. \nThe responsibility for admission decisions will be vested in the Faculty \nAdmission Committees or in the Deans of the respective Faculties, as \nthe councils of such Faculties will determine.” \n6. GFC Academic Standards Committee (ASC) Terms of Reference \n(Mandate): The Office of the Provost and Vice-President (Academic) \nhas determined that the proposed changes are substantial in nature. \nASC’s terms of reference provide that “the term ‘substantial’ refers to \nproposals which involve or affect more than one Faculty or unit; are part \nof a proposal for a new program; are likely to have a financial impact; \nrepresent a definite departure from current policy; involve a quota; \narticulate a new academic concept\" (3.A.ii). \nFurther, “ASC provides advice or recommends to the GFC Academic \nPlanning Committee (APC) on proposals which involve substantial \nchange to admission/transfer regulations or academic standing.\" (3.B.iv) \n7. GFC Academic Planning Committee (APC) Terms of Reference \n(Mandate/Establishment/Termination of Academic Programs): \n“NOTE: APC deals with major program matters; minor program matters \nare dealt with through the GFC-mandated course/program approval \nprocess. The Provost and Vice-President (Academic) decides what is \nmajor or minor. \na. To approve the establishment of new academic programs at the \nUniversity of Alberta or those administered in cooperation with \nother post-secondary institutions.” (3.8.) \nAttachment \n1.  Proposal for course-based MA in HADVC, Templates A and B1 with appendices and Calendar change  \nPrepared by: Janice Hurlburt, Graduate Governance and Policy Coordinator, jhurlbur@ualberta.ca \nNew Program Proposal – System Coordination Review 1 \nDegree Programs  \nNew Degree Proposal Template \n(Part A: System Coordination Review) \nThe following template outlines the information required by Advanced Education and Technology to \nsupport System Coordination Review, the first of the two stages in the review process for new degree \nprograms and new specializations in existing degree programs. Completed templates are to be \nsubmitted electronically through the ministry’s Program and Provider Registry System. \nThe guiding premise of System Coordination Review is to ensure that the program adds value to \nCampus Alberta. This stage of review will focus on the institution’s assessment of student and \nemployer demand; the situation of the program in the context of Campus Alberta; and the financial \nviability of the program, including implications for students and taxpayers. \nGiven a positive outcome from System Coordination Review, the proposed program will be \nrecommended to the Minster for referral to Campus Alberta Quality Council for quality assessment, \nthe second stage of review. Please refer to the council’s publication, CAQC Handbook: Quality \nAssessment and Assurance, for further information. This publication is available on the Council’s \nwebsite http://caqc.gov.ab.ca.     \nBasic Information \nInstitution University of Alber ta \nProgram/specialization title \nCourse-based M A in the H istory of Ar t, \nDesign and Visual Culture (H ADVC) \nCredential awarded M aster  of Ar ts \nProposed Implementation Date July 1, 2019 \nSECTION 1:  PROGRAM OVERVIEW \n1.1  Type of Initiative \nNew degree program; or new specialization(s) in existing program. \nThis is a new course-based Master of Arts (MA) program in the History of Art, Design and Visual Culture \n(HADVC). The University currently offers a thesis-based Master of Arts (MA) in the History of Art, Design and \nVisual Culture. \n1.2  Program Description \nProvide a brief (1-2 paragraph) description of the program, summarizing its intended purpose, curriculum \ndesign, and methods of delivery and highlighting distinctive attributes.  Attach as an Appendix a complete list of \nhttp://caqc.gov.ab.ca/\nNew Program Proposal – System Coordination and Quality Review 2 \nDegree Programs  \ncourses, including credit values, instructional hours and brief (calendar style) course descriptions.  For elective \noptions, specify course selection parameters. Identify new courses to be developed for this program.   \nThere are currently two graduate degrees offered in the History of Art, Design and Visual Culture (HADCV): \nthe thesis-based Master of Arts (MA) and the thesis-based Philosophy of Arts (PhD). These degrees are offered \nthrough the Department of Art and Design in the Faculty of Arts. This proposal is to add a course-based MA in \nthe History of Art, Design and Visual Culture to the Department’s offerings. \nThe current UofA programs in HADVC conform to most North American art history graduate programs in \nterms of required course load, length of program, examination, and thesis or dissertation requirements. Both the \ncurrent and proposed programs are organized around three areas of specialization: i) Modern and Contemporary \nVisual Art and Theory from the nineteenth-century to the present; ii) Modern and Contemporary Design and \nDesign Theory from the nineteenth-century to the present; iii) The Visual and Material Cultures of East Asia \n(China and Japan). These three areas are united in their broad global and interdisciplinary commitment to the \nstudy of visual and material culture. In that sense, the current and proposed programs in HADVC are unified by \nthe faculty members’ consistent dedication to critical theory, visuality (ways of seeing), and the exploration of \ncultural and material interaction, rather than to limited or narrowly focused periods or specializations. \nThe new degree will offer a flexible graduate degree option for students, artists, community members, and \nteachers who have completed a Bachelor’s degree in the history of art or a related discipline. It will also be of \nuse to students who have completed other graduate programs, such as the Master of Fine Arts (MFA). The \ndegree is designed to allow completion in one year, although it may also be completed part time over a longer \nperiod of time. Except for the capstone course, which will be available as independent study, it makes use of \ncourses that are already in place and regularly offered. All of these seminars meet once a week for a single three-\nhour block on the main campus of the University of Alberta. Our goal is to make this degree option available as \nof September 2019. A complete list of courses and calendar descriptions is included in Appendix A. \n1.3  Enrolment Plan \nInclude assumptions and explanatory notes (e.g., attrition, part-time enrolment).  Also: \n• If program implementation will occur over a number of years, provide data for each year to full \nimplementation. \n• If internal reallocation of existing resources is proposed, describe any anticipated decrease in \nenrolment in other programs that would result.   \nWe anticipate accepting 5 students per year into this program and plan to cap the number of accepted students at \nthat number. Although this number may appear small, we will be integrating the students into courses that are \nalso taken by the thesis-based MA students in order to prevent any sense of isolation on the part of the incoming \nstudents, both Canadian and international, and in order to ensure an efficient use of current resources.  \nThis table assumes three full-time and two part-time students (those spreading the program out over 2 years \nrather than 1) will enter each year. We experience very low attrition rates in our current programs and therefore \nexpect little attrition in this new program as well. \nExisting resources will be used to accommodate these students, and we anticipate little decreased enrolment \nfrom other programs.  \nNew Program Proposal – System Coordination and Quality Review 3 \nDegree Programs  \nProposed Enrolment Year 1 Year 2 Year 3 Year 4 Year 5 Annual Ongoing \nTotal head count 5 7 7 7 7 7 \n• Full-Time Year 1 3 3 3 3 3 3 \n• Part-Time Year 1 2 2 2 2 2 2 \n• Full-Time Year 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 \n• Part-time Year 2 0 2 2 2 2 2 \n• Full-Time Year 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 \n• Full-Time Year 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 \nTotal FLE 0 0 0 0 0 0 \n• FLE Year 1 4 4 4 4 4 4 \n• FLE Year 2 0 1 1 1 1 1 \n• FLE Year 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 \n• FLE Year 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 \nAnticipated No. of Graduates 3 5 5 5 5 5 \nSECTION 2:  DEMAND \n2.1  Student Demand Analysis \nAnalysis should be supported by relevant data for the region and for Campus Alberta, as might be derived from: \nsystematic questionnaire surveys of target audiences; application and enrolment summaries and trends for \nsimilar programs currently offered by other institutions; tabulations of unsolicited student inquiries and/or \nexpressions of interest obtained at student recruitment events; demographic projections for relevant sub-\npopulations.  \nWhile it is admittedly difficult to measure job opportunities quantitatively, there is substantial qualitative data to \nsupport a need in this area. Demand is demonstrated by repeated inquiry made by students, by the regular \nposting of job openings requiring this type of degree, and by the success of such degree programs in other parts \nof Canada. The Graduate Program Administrator for HADVC receives regular inquiries about the availability of \na course-based MA degree. \nA short survey was sent to the currently enrolled thesis-based MA students asking them whether they thought a \ncourse-based MA option would be of interest to students who were not currently considering graduate \neducation. All 8 of the students who responded to the survey answered in the affirmative.  \nStudents interested in this graduate degree will be looking to study close to home, yet there are no comparable \nprograms in the prairie provinces of Alberta, Saskatchewan or Manitoba. A few universities in Ontario, such as \nthe University of Western Ontario and Carleton University, have initiated such degrees with success. The dearth \nof options in western Canada will make this program attractive to those seeking to upgrade their education and \nimprove their job opportunities. We will particularly welcome potential students from northern and indigenous \ncommunities, who otherwise lack access to programs such as this one. \n2.2  Labour Market Analysis \nNew Program Proposal – System Coordination and Quality Review 4 \nDegree Programs  \nAnalysis should be supported by relevant data and placed in the context of the target occupational/regional \nlabour market(s).  Relevant data sources include systematic surveys of prospective employers; occupational \nsupply/demand projections from government or industry sources; tabulations of job postings/‘help wanted’ \nadvertising; surveys of recruitment and graduate employment rates of similar programs; and demographic \nprojections (i.e. for relevant regions and sub-populations.)  Describe anticipated employment outcomes. \nStudents with a course-based MA in HADVC will have numerous employment opportunities available to them. \nThey could, for example, pursue such positions as director, curator or education officer at art galleries, historical \nsites and museums; participate in the art market by selling or promoting various kinds of art and visual culture; \nwork as researchers in libraries and archives; and undertake work in the cultural sector for governmental \norganizations. We have received a number of letters from professionals in these fields attesting to demand for \nsuch a program (see Appendix B). \nQuantitative information supporting this Labour Market Analysis is available and includes the following: \nThe Government of Alberta 2016 Labour Market Review shows that the Industry of Information, Culture and \nRecreation employment rose by 1,400 jobs and Occupations in Art, Culture, Recreation and Sport rose by 7,700. \nSee https://work.alberta.ca/documents/annual-alberta-labour-market-review.pdf \nThe Government of Alberta’s February 2017 Labour Force Statistics Highlights lists Information, Culture and \nRecreation as the Industry with the highest employment increase, at 4,900 positions. See \nhttps://work.alberta.ca/documents/labour-force-stats-2017-02-highlights.pdf. The February 2017 Labour Force \nStatistics Public Package also shows an increase when compared to the month before. \nSee https://work.alberta.ca/documents/labour-force-stats-2017-02-public-package.pdf \nThe Government’s Occupational Demand and Supply Outlook, 2015-2025, projects demand for Managers in \nArt, Culture, Recreation & Sport (A34) growing from 1,401 in 2015 to 1,634 in 2025. \nSee https://work.alberta.ca/documents/occupational-demand-and-supply-outlook-2015-2025.pdf \nIn addition, the following organizations regularly list positions for graduates with this type of degree.

A \ndescription of these two priorities begin as follows: \nTEACHING AND LEARNING: This is the core activity of the university—supporting undergraduate and \ngraduate students, researchers, and scholars, as well as accomplished members of professions who need to \nrefresh their educations to advance their positions in industry or to advance industry itself.  \nCOMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT: The university is focused on enhancing the communities in which it operates, \nas well as the communities with which it engages, both near and far. The university will strive to maintain and \nexpand connections with communities, increasing engagement and consultation.  \nCanada’s Creative Economy contributes in valuable and growing ways to the lives and wellbeing of its citizens, \nand the course-based MA in the History of Art, Design and Visual Culture will prepare graduates to assume \nleadership positions in this sector of the economy. Graduates of this program will be able to think critically and \nproductively about the place of history and the arts in contemporary life. These individuals are essential for the \ncreation, maintenance and promotion of societal exchange and public spaces that are creatively, culturally and \ntechnologically innovative.  \n3.2  Institutional Programs \nExplain how the proposed program fits with existing programs at the institution, and the anticipated positive or \nnegative impacts on other programs. \nThe proposed program complements and does not duplicate other programs within the institution. Several other \ndepartments at the University of Alberta—English & Film Studies, History & Classics, Political Science, and \nSociology—have course-based MA programs that are structurally similar to ours, but none of these focus on the \nvisual world and creative production. Physical Education, Recreation, and Leisure has a course-based MA that \nfocuses on the use of such public spaces as parks, playgrounds, and natural preserves. Our program, in contrast, \nengages with the world of human-made art, objects, and other forms of visual communication. \nThis new program complements our current thesis-based MA and PhD programs directed toward mentoring and \ntraining young professionals as academics and at the same time places an important emphasis on providing \npractical skills that would enable students to pursue various kinds of employment. For example, the Ethics and \nProfessional Training requirement, which the Department of Art and Design already offers to and requires of all \ngraduate students, combines theoretical and practical discussions of the discipline of art, design, the academy, \nthe museum, and the market, ensuring that students attain practical teaching, research, organizational, and \ncommunication skills. This program of study allows students to pursue employment well beyond the academy, \nas museum professionals, or within the governmental or private sectors. \nNew Program Proposal – System Coordination and Quality Review 7 \nDegree Programs  \nThe course-based MA differs from the thesis-based MA in the History of Art, Design and Visual Culture. \nWhereas students in the thesis-based program are preparing for PhD work and research careers, students in this \nnew program will be preparing for professional and managerial careers in the arts. Students in the course-based \nMA will not spend a full year on the development of a narrowly focused thesis, which will enable them to take \nmore courses and thereby diversify their knowledge of the visual arts. A one–term capstone course taken at the \nend of their program will pair course-based MA students one-on-one with an academic advisor, providing \nstudents with a personalized and intensive research experience. \nThe course-based MA also differs from the MFA (Master of Fine Arts. Whereas both the course-based and \nthesis-based MA are seminar-based programs, the MFA is a studio-based program designed for practitioners. \nStudents in the MFA, in contrast to students in the MA programs, are preparing for careers as artists. \n3.3  Internal Review and Approval \nProvide a brief description of the internal review and approval process followed in developing the proposal. \nThis proposal was developed in consultation with Dr Steven Harris, Acting Chair of the Department of Art and \nDesign; Dr Lianne McTavish, Associate Chair (Graduate Studies) in the Department of Art and Design; Dawn \nMcLean, Graduate Student Advisor in the Department of Art and Design; Sean Caulfield, Centennial Professor \nand faculty member in charge of Fine Arts in the Department of Art and Design, and all the permanent faculty \nteaching classes in the History of Art, Design and Visual Culture.  \nConsultation has also taken place with Dr Nat Kav, Vice-Provost (Programs), Office of the Provost and Vice \nPresident (Academic), Kate Peters, Portfolio Initiatives Manager for the Provost and Vice-President \n(Academic); Dr Deborah Burstyn, Vice Dean, Faculty of Graduate Studies and Research (FGSR); Dr Bryan \nHogeveen, Associate Dean, FGSR; and Janice Hurlburt, Governance & Policy Coordinator, FGSR. FGSR has \nalso liaised with the Registrar’s Office. Consultation on issues of budget have taken place with Edith Finczak, \nDirector, Academic Budgeting and Programming. Dr Thomas Spalding, Associate Dean (Graduate Studies) and \nRose Yu, Director, Strategy, Initiatives, Facilities and Finance in the Faculty of Arts also provided important \ninformation on drafting this proposal. \nInternal Review also stipulates Department Council, Arts Academic Committee, Arts Executive Committee, \nArts Faculty Council, and FGSR Council, as well as the ASC Subcommittee on Standards (SOS), the Academic \nStandards Committee (ASC), and the Academic Planning Committee of the General Faculty Council (GFC). \nConsultation with all these bodies is taking place. \n3.4  Campus Alberta Programs/Initiatives \nDiscuss the relationships (similarity, complementarity, transfer, competition) of the proposed program to other \nprograms or initiatives in Campus Alberta and explain what the proposed program would add to the system. If \nthe proposed program would duplicate existing programs, explain why that duplication is warranted. \nThis program does not duplicate, but rather complements and expands, existing programs in Campus Alberta.  \nThe Department of Art and Design already has strong ties with colleges and universities throughout the \nprovince, maintained by participating at jointly-sponsored conferences and hosting visiting speakers, and also \nby the regular application of students from those universities for entry into both undergraduate and graduate \nprograms at the University of Alberta. In particular, we receive many applications and regularly accept students \nfrom MacEwan University, Red Deer College, Keyano College, Grand Prairie Regional College, and Medicine \nNew Program Proposal – System Coordination and Quality Review 8 \nDegree Programs  \nHat College into our Bachelor’s programs. Furthermore, a number of our graduates teach at these universities \nand colleges.  \nCampus Alberta institutions that offer Bachelor’s degrees graduating students who would be interested in the \ncourse-based MA include the University of Calgary, the University of Lethbridge, and the Alberta College of \nArt and Design. These institutions also offer MFA programs graduating students who might seek to upgrade \ntheir credentials by pursuing a course-based MA. Most of the undergraduate programming offered by other \nuniversities and colleges in Alberta similarly emphasizes the key areas identified as specializations for the \nproposed program, especially modern and contemporary art and visual culture. Letters of support from many of \nthese institutions have been included with this proposal in Appendix B. \nThe proposed program thus builds on strengths, expanding opportunities for specialized study within Alberta \nand the region. \n3.5  Consultation \nSummarize the type and outcomes of consultations with other institutions offering related programs. Attach \ncopies of relevant documents (e.g. letters, meeting summaries). Discuss the potential for inter-institutional \ncollaboration.   \nOur already strong relationships with other Campus Alberta campuses, from which our students come and for \nwhich our graduates teach, ensures inter-institutional collaboration. The following independent experts beyond \nthe University of Alberta’s Faculty of Arts have consulted with us, provided feedback, and expressed explicit \nsupport for this proposal:  \nDr. Kathryn Shailer, Acting Research Officer and Special Advisor for Graduate Studies and \nInternationalization, Alberta College of Art and Design \nDr. Kenneth Allen, Associate Professor of Art History, University of Lethbridge \nDr Anne Dymond, Associate Professor, Art History and Museum Studies, University of Lethbridge \nDr. Allan Gilliland, Dean, Faculty of Fine Arts, MacEwan University \nDean Smale, Coordinator of Visual Communications, Medicine Hat College \nJason Frizzell, Dean, School of Creative Arts, Red Deer College \nJia Wang, Acting Director, China Institute, University of Alberta \nDr. Randolph Wimmer, Interim Dean, Faculty of Education, University of Alberta \nCopies of their letters are attached to this proposal as Appendix B.  \n3.6  Learner Pathways \n3.6.1 Identify potential pathways from work to school (where applicable). \nCommunity members: This degree will be useful to community members working in museums and historic \nsites. Because the degree offers a part-time option, these individuals will not need to leave their current jobs in \norder to upgrade their skills.  \nPrimary and secondary art teachers: Teachers regularly take, and look for, accessible and flexible \ngraduate programs for reasons of personal and professional development, salary increases, and to meet changing \ngovernment standards for teachers and school leaders. The degree will therefore be of interest to art teachers, \nwho can take advantage of both the part time and, during a sabbatical year, the full time option. \nNew Program Proposal – System Coordination and Quality Review 9 \nDegree Programs  \nArtists: Working artists both with and without the MFA degree would be able to enroll in this program to \nadvance their knowledge of modern art and its histories.  \n3.6.2 Identify potential opportunities for transfer/laddering into the proposed program from other institutions or \nother programs within the institution; and for transfer/laddering from the proposed program to other \nprograms within the institution or at other institutions. List any formal agreements for internal or inter-\ninstitutional transfer/laddering that have been negotiated to this point. \nMFA students: The MFA, which is a terminal degree, is required for artists who plan to teach at the post-\nsecondary level. At many two-year colleges and some small four-year universities, artists also teach \nintroductory art history classes as part of their teaching assignment. Students with an MFA and an MA degree \nwill be especially well prepared for the competitive post-secondary job market. \nInternational students: We receive a number of inquiries from international students every year, asking about the \npossibility of doing a thesis-based MA or a PhD after completing study in their home country. The course-based \nMA will serve those students who want a bridge year, during which they can improve their English skills and \nadjust to the North American learning environment, before entering into a thesis-based degree programs in \nHADVC. \nRecently completed BA students: Students who have completed a Bachelor’s degree in the history of art or a \nrelated field may expand their knowledge of art and visual culture by completing a one-year course-based MA. \nWe have no formal agreements for internal or inter-institutional transfers. \n3.6.3 Estimate the portion of graduates who can be expected to proceed to further education directly. At a later \nstage in their careers.  What types of programs/credentials would they be most likely to pursue?   \nWe estimate that half the students will be international. The majority of course-based MA students will not \npursue further advanced education, although a few may choose to pursue research degrees (the thesis-based MA \nor the PhD). \nSECTION 4:  FINANCIAL VIABILITY AND SUSTAINABILITY \n4.1  Annual Budget and Funding Sources \nIdentify annual and one-time expenditures and annual revenue for the program in the budget tables below.  If \nprogram implementation will take place over more than one year, provide estimates for each year until full \nimplementation.  Provide explanatory notes for all budget assumptions, such as inflation and per student tuition. \n(For proposals without significant impacts on institutional costs, revenues or enrolment, a detailed budget presentation will \nnot normally be required (please confirm with the department). Such proposals will satisfy all of the following tests: \n1. The proposal is for a new specialization in an existing program, consisting of an innovative combination of existing \ncurricula. \n2. Overall enrolment capacity in the program is maintained. \n3. Excepting incidental administrative and promotional costs, no start-up or incremental operations costs are incurred.) \nThe implementation of this course-based MA option will make the current thesis-based MA less \nexpensive to offer per student. Resources which are currently being used to deliver courses to the \nthesis-based MA students will now be used to fund courses taken by both thesis and course-based MA \nNew Program Proposal – System Coordination and Quality Review 10 \nDegree Programs  \nstudents. This new option will bring costs down and more students will be served because the course-\nbased MA students will be added to already existing courses taken by thesis-based MA students. \nCourse Based Master of Arts - History of Art, Design and Visual Culture (HADVC) Ongoing \nEXPENDITURES     \nAcademic Salaries   \n  Professoriate (including benefits) 33,447  \n  Faculty Service Officers (including benefits) 0  \nAdministrative Professional Officers (including \nbenefits) 1,975  \n  Total Academic Costs 35,422  \nService Teaching Costs   \n  Service Teaching Costs 0  \n  Total Service Teaching Costs 0  \nGraduate Assistants   \n  Other Academic Staff (including benefits) 0  \n  Total GA Costs 0  \nNon-Academic Salaries   \n  Support Staff 10,136  \n  Total Non-Academic Costs 10,136  \nNon-Salary Costs   \nNon-Salary Costs (supplies, sundries, \ncommunications, etc.) 1,189  \n  Total Non-Salary Costs 1,189  \nOther Operating Costs   \n  Faculty Overhead (accounting and human resources) 1,074  \nInstitutional Costs (central finance and HR, registrar, \nlibraries, facility costs, etc.) 17,358  \n  Total Other Costs 18,432  \n  Gross Operating Costs 65,179  \nREVENUES     \n  Domestic Tuition - 2.5 students (24 credits) $5,783.96 14,460  \nInternational Tuition - 2.5 students (24 credits) \n$28,450 28,450  \n  Other: Grants 0  \n  Other: Endowment Proceeds 0  \n  Campus Alberta Operating Grant 22,269  \n    0  \n    0  \n  Total Revenues 65,179  \n   NET PROFIT/LOSS 0  \n   Notes: \nProfessoriate salaries are based on 50% \nteaching 50% research  \nNew Program Proposal – System Coordination and Quality Review 11 \nDegree Programs  \nSupport staff costs and other departmental costs \nwere allocated to the program on the basis of \nstudent headcount numbers. \n Indirect faculty costs were easily identified as the \nFaculty of Arts maintains separate departments \nthat relate to the provision of faculty wide \nservices (student services, HR, finance, etc.).  \nThese were allocated based on student \nheadcount numbers.  \nNew Program Proposal – System Coordination and Quality Review 12 \nDegree Programs  \n4.2  Impact \n4.2.1 Compare the proposed tuition rate with that of similar programs in Campus Alberta. \nCourse-based MA students will pay the standard course-based graduate tuition at the University of Alberta. \nThere will be no extra costs for the students. \nCourse-based MA students would pay $6,789.07 (Canadian students) and $12,384.91 (International students) for \neight 3-credit courses to complete the degree. In comparison, thesis-based MA students pay for two years \nof full-time study, which is $11,200.36 (Canadian students) and $17,577.64 (International students). \n4.2.2 Discuss the financial impact on students and the learner funding system, taking into account the costs of \neducation and the potential debt burden relative to post-graduation earning capacity. \nThe course-based MA option is designed to cost less than the thesis-based MA. Students in the thesis-based MA \nprogram will be offered GTA and GRA funding before the course-based MA students, however both \ncourse-based and thesis-based students may apply for internal and external scholarships. Students who are \nteachers working to upgrade may be eligible for Professional Development funds from their home \ninstitutions. Students working in government-sponsored cultural industries jobs may also have \nProfessional Development funds available. The costs for the course-based MA will make this option \nattractive to students concerned about the costs of education and their potential debt burden relative to \npost-graduation earning capacity. Upgraded credentials will, moreover, enable these individuals to more \neasily move up the salary scale in the workplace. \n4.2.3 If program funding includes internal reallocation, evaluate the impact of this reallocation on the \ninstitution’s operations and overall financial position. \nThe course-based MA differs from the thesis-based MA in the History of Art, Design and Visual Culture. \nWhereas students in that program are preparing for PhD work and research careers, students in this new \nprogram will be preparing for professional and managerial careers in the arts. Students in the course-based \nMA will not spend a full year on the development of a narrowly focused thesis, enabling them to take \nmore courses and thereby diversifying their knowledge of the visual arts instead. A one–term capstone \ncourse taken at the end of their program will pair course-based MA students one-on-one with an \nAcademic Advisor, providing students with a personalized and intensive research experience. \nThe costs that are currently allocated for thesis-based MA students will now be used for both course-based and \nthesis-based MA students. The current faculty has the capacity to advise these additional students. We will \nalso be able to continue supervising the same number of thesis-based students. \nRECOMMENDATION (FOR DEPARTMENT USE) \nDo Any Issues or Information Gaps Remain? \nRecommendation(s) \nNew Program Proposal – System Coordination and Quality Review 13 \nDegree Programs  \nReviewer(s) \nDate Completed \nNew Program Proposal Part B1 – Campus Alberta Quality Council Review \nPart B.1: Campus Alberta Quality Council Review \nDegree Programs that  \nAre Similar to Existing Programming \nFor proposals that are not significant departures from existing programming, institutions may complete \nPart B.1:  Degree Programs that are Similar to Existing Programming.  This is in keeping with the \nprinciple that the extent of review and the amount of information required for approval should in each \ncase reflect the type of proposal and the maturity of the applicant institution.   \nWhen a new degree program is being proposed that is a significant departure from existing \nprogramming at the applicant institution, the full Part B template must be completed.  Part B.1 requires \nless information than the full Part B template, and applies to:  \n• Degrees and/or new majors/specializations within existing degrees that are built on \nexisting program structures (i.e., with only modest changes to existing programs) and are \noffered primarily from existing course offerings, faculty, and other resources and where \nonly modest changes in learning outcomes are proposed. \nExamples where less information was needed by Council (with relevant considerations for \nusing this template): \no SPLITTING AN EXISTING CROP SCIENCE MAJOR INTO TWO NEW MAJORS: PLANT \nBIOTECHNOLOGY AND AGRONOMY \n no new courses, instructors, or additional resources required  \n fewer core courses required for each of the new majors compared to the original single \nmajor, but this difference is compensated for in the requirements for the individual \nmajors \n used to be two streams \n no new requirements for designation \no ADDING ITALIAN STUDIES TO AN EXISTING BA PROGRAM THAT HAS OTHER ITALIAN \nPROGRAMMING \n Italian language minor exists in a department having French and Spanish majors \n built on aspects of Italian language and culture which draw on other areas \n creating a major where only a minor existed before \n additional staffing requirements are identified \n  \n although institution has substantial existing capacity in this area, five new courses need \nto be created \no RESTRUCTURING AN EXISTING BSC IN AGRICULTURE (SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURAL \nSYSTEMS) AS A BSC IN ENVIRONMENTAL AND CONSERVATION SCIENCES (SUSTAINABLE \nAGRICULTURE \n only minimal changes in the courses required for the proposed degree compared to the \ndegree it will replace \n instructors from the current program will teach the courses required for the proposed \nNew Program Proposal Part B1 – Campus Alberta Quality Council Review \nprogram \n to more clearly communicate the content and purpose of the degree to prospective \nstudents, proposed change will merely reposition the degree as a BSc in Environmental \nand Conservation Sciences instead of a BSc Agriculture \no NEW MA AND PHD PROGRAM IN COMMUNICATION AND CULTURE BASED ON RESTRUCTURING \nOF TWO EXISTING MA AND PHD PROGRAMS – CULTURE AND SOCIETY AND COMMUNICATION \nSTUDIES \n amalgamation of two programs whose respective subject matters have tended to \nconverge in recent years \n no changes to program structure for the MA, and the only change for the PhD program \nis addition of a single course \n no new quality assessment issues as existing courses and resources (including \ninstructors) will be used \n• Renamed degree programs that also include changes to curriculum or other changes (i.e. \nmore substantive than what would be submitted on the PAPRS Program/Specialization \nName Changes template). \nExamples where less information was needed by Council (with relevant considerations for \nusing this template): \no RENAMING BACHELOR OF KINESIOLOGY (PEDAGOGY) TO A BACHELOR OF KINESIOLOGY \n(LEADERSHIP IN PEDAGOGY AND COACHING) \n program already has leadership curriculum embedded in course content \n proposed change extends beyond nomenclature as the proposed program will offer a \nchoice between two concentrations – pedagogy or coaching; current program only \noffers a pedagogy concentration (which contains significant coaching content) \no RENAMING MSC PHYSICAL THERAPY TO MSC REHABILITATION SCIENCE   \n as the institution already offers a PhD in Rehabilitation Science, the name change is not \ncontroversial \n proposal is to combine three masters-level therapy programs into one, taught by the \ncurrent complement of instructors \nApplicants should consult with the CAQC Secretariat before beginning to complete the template if \nthey are unsure as to which template may be appropriate.  The default template is the full Part B \ntemplate.  Please add a brief rationale to your request for fully expedited review that explains why the \nPART B1 template is being chosen rather than the full Part B template. \nInstructions for completing this template:  Please note that although the questions below are the same \nas those in the full Part B, guidelines for answering each question or set of questions in the context of \nthe type of proposal that should be submitted on Part B.1 are provided throughout in red text.  In \ngeneral, applicants should focus on those elements of the proposed program that are distinctive, \nunique, or enhanced.   \nNew Program Proposal Part B1 – Campus Alberta Quality Council Review \nAs noted at the beginning of Part A, given a positive outcome from the System Coordination Review, \nthe Minister may refer the proposed program to the Campus Alberta Quality Council for quality \nassessment, the second stage of review. \nThe onus is on the applicant institution to satisfy Council that the level of learning to be achieved is \nconsistent with that which is expected at the proposed degree level, that the program has sufficient \nbreadth and rigour to meet national and international standards as outlined in, for example, the \nCanadian Degree Qualifications Framework (CDQF), and that the program is comparable in quality to \nsimilar programs (if any) offered in Alberta and elsewhere.  The program proposal should demonstrate \nhow Council’s program quality standards and any applicable guidelines have been addressed and \ndescribe any unique dimensions that set the program apart from similar programs thus providing new \neducational opportunities for students. \nNOTE: Part A of the program proposal may undergo changes as a result of the System Coordination \nReview.  It is important that Part A be up-to-date and complete before it is forwarded to Council.  \nBuilding on the information provided in Part A, the program proposal that is sent to Council should \ncontain the following additional information.  When possible, web links to existing policy documents \nand institutional policies should be provided, rather than recopying them in response to questions. \nWhen noting pre-existing material, please provide a reference or web link to the relevant materials. \nSECTION 5:  PROGRAM SPECIFICS \nThe Office of Provost and Vice-President Academic was informed by the CAQC that Template B1 was \nthe appropriate format for this proposal. Accordingly, we have followed the guidelines for expedited \nreview. This proposal is for a Degree Program that is Similar to Existing Programming. \n5.1 Program Structure and Learning Outcomes \nInstructions:  Since the proposal is for programming that is closely related to existing approved \nprogramming, the responses to questions should describe the proposed program learning outcomes and \nidentify how the learning outcomes and other features of the proposed program will differ from \nexisting offerings.  For example, it may be possible to reference existing degree structures to satisfy the \nrequirements of s. 5.1.3 and much of 5.1.4.  Attach as an appendix proposed changes to calendar \ndescriptions. \n5.1.1 Describe the program’s learning outcomes and how they were established. How will the \nachievement of the learning outcomes be evaluated? Providing a mapping of the courses to the \nlearning outcomes, particularly in professional programs, is helpful. \nThe learning outcomes for this program were established in consultation with all faculty currently \nteaching in HADVC graduate programs on how to serve the new course-based curriculum and \nits students. \nCoursework that both course-based and thesis-based MA students undertake is a primary means for \nstudents both to learn and to improve a number of skills. Whereas course-based students will \nNew Program Proposal Part B1 – Campus Alberta Quality Council Review \ntake more classes and thus gain depth in multiple subject areas, thesis-based MA students take \nfewer classes and develop more depth in a single area. The skills acquired in coursework by \nboth sets us students include the following:  \n1) close visual analysis. Students will be trained to perform visual analyses that draw from a range of \nmethods informed by formalism, semiotics, post-colonial theory, and feminism, to name only a \nfew possible approaches. Students should be able to identify what kinds of approaches work best \nfor the kinds of problems, images and concepts they wish to address in their own research. Their \nabilities will be assessed in course assignments which require students to apply and test various \ninterpretive methods, defending the one(s) they eventually select. All courses contribute to this \noutcome. Course-based MA students will take more classes and therefore have opportunities to \ndevelop these skills in more subject areas than do thesis-based students. \n2) clear expression of ideas in relation to the study of visual and material culture. Students will be \ntrained to express themselves in both oral and written formats, adapting their presentations to \ndifferent audiences. Students will write coherent research papers that are thoroughly researched \nand supported by both evidence and logic, paying particular attention to the convincing use of \nvisual evidence; they will teach specific lessons to undergraduates as part of their coursework, \ntesting their abilities in numerous settings, including formal essay writing activities and giving \nguest lectures, productions that can be observed and evaluated by faculty members. All courses \ncontribute to this outcome. Course-based MA students will take more classes and therefore have \nopportunities to develop these skills in more subject areas than do thesis-based students. \n3) the ability to formulate an original research problem relevant to the study of visual culture. This skill \nis developed during the process of essay writing and the assessment of that writing, at which \ntime the development of a research question, as well as the appropriate theoretical and \nmethodological approaches to investigate it, will be discussed and evaluated. This skill is \nparticularly targeted for thesis-based students in the MA thesis, and it will be targeted for \ncourse-based students in the capstone course. Thesis-based MA students write a more extensive \nindividualized research project than course-based students, thereby developing greater depth in a \nsingle subject area. \n4) the ability to make a research plan that contributes to the diverse and expanding fields of art, design \nand visual culture. This conceptual ability is developed by students during various courses, but \nalso receives direct and sustained attention during the thesis year (for thesis-based MA students) \nand in the capstone (for course-based students). Thesis-based MA students write a more \nextensive individualized research project than course-based students, thereby developing greater \ndepth in a single subject area. \n5) the ability to deliver a conference paper and write a grant proposal, highlighting the unique and \nspecific demands of the study of art and visual culture. The more practical aspects of these skills \nwill be practiced and evaluated in Professional Development workshops, with students \ndelivering mock papers in front of their peers, for example. Particular attention will be paid to \nthe convincing display and pedagogical use of visual images, and the standards of \nprofessionalization within museums and the art world. All courses contribute to this outcome. \nBoth course-based and thesis-based MA students receive this training. \nNew Program Proposal Part B1 – Campus Alberta Quality Council Review \n5.1.2 Students are expected to demonstrate independent scholarly activity applicable to the degree \nlevel and expectations of its graduates (see the CDQF). Describe the academic culture that will \nnurture and support student scholarly and creative activity.  \nUniversity of Alberta programs in HADVC conform to most North American art history programs in \nterms of required course load, length of program, and capstone experiences. Our program is \norganized around three areas of specialization: i) Modern and Contemporary Visual Art and \nTheory from the nineteenth-century to the present; ii) Modern and Contemporary Design and \nDesign Theory; iii) The Visual and Material Cultures of East Asia. These three areas are united \nin their broad international and interdisciplinary commitment to visual and material culture, \nrather than only to objects designated as art. In that sense, the program in HADVC is unified by \nthe faculty members’ consistent dedication to critical theory, visuality, and the exploration of \ncultural and material interaction in the context of their particular areas of specialization. \nAll faculty members in HADVC are active researchers and successful teachers who regularly integrate \ntheir specializations into their pedagogical practices. Courses offered at the graduate level are \norganized with the needs of students in mind, in addition to being closely related to the scholarly \nwork of individual professors in HADVC. See the attached course listings in Appendix A for a \nlisting of graduate courses offered during the 2015-16 and 2016-17 academic years. \nIndependent scholarly activity in this new program will be primarily assessed through the capstone \ncourse (3 credits), which will usually be taken during the final term of the student’s program. \nThesis-based MA students take fewer classes and work with a faculty supervisor over the course \nof a year to develop a highly-focused research project, which is then defended through an oral \nexam in front of the supervisor, a second reader, and an external examiner. In contrast, the \ncourse-based MA students take more classes (thus acquiring depth in more subjects) and work \nover one semester with a faculty advisor to write capstone paper. The capstone of the course-\nbased MA degree program provides students with an opportunity to engage in independent \nresearch and explore an original topic in which they are interested. The faculty advisor for each \nstudent’s capstone will be selected by the student in consultation with the HADVC Graduate \nAdvisor. The student will work closely with the advisor to undertake research related to a topic \nthat has been initially explored in earlier coursework. In addition to research skills, the student \nwill develop analytical, methodological, interpretive and expository skills appropriate to the \nfield of art and visual culture. The culminating research paper, of approximately 30-40 pages in \nlength, will be evaluated by the advisor and a second faculty member in HADVC. \n5.1.3 For undergraduate degrees, demonstrate (in a table, if possible) how the program meets the \nrelevant section of CAQC’s Expectations for Design and Structure of Undergraduate Degrees. \nNot applicable; this is a graduate degree. \n5.1.4 Provide an outline of the program structure and requirements (major, minor, cognates, core, \ngeneral education, etc.) including credits in each category, and a summary description of the \ncurriculum. Note any new courses. Course outlines must be available for reviewers but are NOT \nto be included with the proposal. (See sample table below - note that this is provided as a \nNew Program Proposal Part B1 – Campus Alberta Quality Council Review \nguideline only for a typical baccalaureate program, and will be different for other \nbaccalaureate and graduate programs).   \nInstructions:  If course outlines are unavailable for new courses or courses which have been or \nwill be substantially revised, sufficient information must nonetheless be available to academic \nexperts the institution engages during its internal program approval process and to Council to \nenable evaluation and informed decision regarding how these courses will contribute to the \nprogram.  \nWhereas the thesis-based MA consists of *18 total, plus the writing of a thesis, the course-based MA \nwill consist of the following: \n*24 total, composed of  \n*21 coursework \nplus *3 capstone  \nHADVC 600 Theory & Methods is required, if not taken previously, and counts toward the *21 \nProfessional Development and Ethics Training (non-credit)  \nUp to *6 may be taken outside the History of Art, Design and Visual Culture \nStudents who wish to complete the degree in one year may enroll in 4 courses (12 credits) in each of \ntheir two terms (fall and winter). Upon completion of their first term of coursework, they will meet \nwith the HADVC Graduate Advisor to select a faculty member with whom to complete the capstone. \nThe second term of coursework will consist of 3 additional courses (9 credits) and the capstone (3 \ncredits), which will be available during all academic terms. The Professional Development and Ethics \nTraining may also be completed during the course of fall and winter terms. Course outlines for all \ncourses are available upon request.  \nStudents who wish to complete the degree part time, will work with the Graduate Advisor to develop a \nschedule of courses that will ensure completion of the degree in the FSGR allowed time frame of six \nyears. All graduate courses meet once a week as 3-hour seminars, which allows most working students \nthe flexibility to complete the degree part time. The capstone may be taken after completion of at least \n4 courses (12 credits). \nAll classes chosen will be on the graduate level, taken primarily with faculty in the HADVC. Up to \ntwo courses (6 credits) may be outside the HADVC division. These courses may include offerings, all \nof which would be accessible to working professionals, from Anthropology, Drama, Education, \nEnglish & Film Studies, History & Classics, Music, Philosophy, Sociology, Women & Gender Studies, \namong others. Students from the field of Education, for example, may elect to take such Secondary \nEducation courses as Media and Popular Culture in the Curriculum (EDSE 508) or Hands on History \n(EDSE 501), among other options. Students with a graduate degree in fine arts, the MFA may also take \nup to two courses in a studio discipline other than that named in their degree. For example, a student \nwith an MFA in Printmaking may take up to two Art courses in any studio area other than printmaking. \nCourses from outside the division must be approved by the Graduate Advisor. \nIn addition to the required coursework, graduate students will participate in Professional Development \nand Ethics Training organized by the Department of Art and Design and the Faculty of Graduate \nStudies and Research. These seminars are designed to provide graduate students with training in the \nNew Program Proposal Part B1 – Campus Alberta Quality Council Review \npractical aspects of the field. Sessions, which often include invited experts from both within and \noutside the University of Alberta, are held on a monthly basis throughout both semesters, offering \nadvice about such practical topics as photographing works of art; using digital images and questions of \ncopyright; constructing a syllabus in visual culture courses (a skill that will be useful for future \nemployment); pedagogical theories and practices; practical methods of course preparation and \ndelivery; grant writing and budget preparation; and constructing a curriculum vitae and cover letter. \nProgram structure  \nComponent 1 \nGraduate \ncourses \n(maximum) \nCredits \nRequirements \nHADVC 600 Theory & Methods 3 credits \nHADVC 900 Capstone 3 credits \nElectives* 6 courses  18 credits \nRequired courses outside HADVC 0 courses 0 credits \nAdditional requirements (please specify) \nEthics Training \nand \nProfessional \nDevelopment  \n0 credits \nTotal 8 courses 24 credits \n* Up to two elective courses (6 credits) may be taken outside HADVC. \nTo assist in demonstrating that the program curriculum is clear and well integrated with the \nobjectives and outcomes, provide one or more typical student programs by year of program (see \nsample table below). \nTypical student program \n1st \nYEAR \nFALL \nCourse \nnumber Course title \nCourse \nlevel \n Role in program Credits \nHADVC \n600  Theory & Methods Grad Required 3 \nHADVC \n503 \nAdvanced Studies in Early Modern Art, \nDesign and Visual Culture Grad Elective 3 \nHADVC \n506 \nAdvanced Studies in Art, Design and Visual \nCulture in the Early 20th Century Grad Elective 3 \nHADVC \n511 \nAdvanced Special Topics in Art, Design \nand Visual Culture Grad Elective 3 \nWINTER \nHADVC \n511 \nAdvanced Special Topics in Art, Design \nand Visual Culture Grad Elective 3 \nHADVC \n512 \nAdvanced Studies in Asian Art, Design and \nVisual Culture Grad Elective 3 \nHADVC \n555 \nAdvanced Studies in in Art, Design and \nVisual Culture in the Second Half of the Grad Elective 3 \nNew Program Proposal Part B1 – Campus Alberta Quality Council Review \n19th Century \nHADVC \n900 Capstone Grad Required 3 \n5.2  Criteria / Requirements for Admission and Academic Progression \nState the admission criteria (including any provision for prior learning assessment), residency \nrequirements, academic performance progression requirements, and graduation requirements \napplicable to the program, along with the grading scheme. Note any program specific regulations \n(e.g., for doctoral programs, note any candidacy or dissertation requirements, examination \nrequirements, time to completion requirements, etc.).   \nInstructions:  If there are no changes from existing requirements for the degree in which the \nmajor/specialization is situated, this may simply be noted. \nThe admission requirements listed in the University of Alberta Calendar will be the same as those for \nthe thesis-based MA, as follows: “An applicant must normally hold a degree in the History of Art (or \nits equivalent) from a recognized institution. Applicants with a bachelor’s degree other than History of \nArt will be considered for admission provided that an adequate background in the History of Art can be \ndemonstrated.” \nThesis-based MA students take fewer classes and write a thesis, which is orally examined by the \nsupervisor, a second reader, and an external examiner. In contrast, the course-based MA students take \nmore classes (thus acquiring depth in more subjects) and work over one semester with a faculty advisor \nto write a capstone paper. Rigor is maintained for the thesis-based MA students by requiring a thesis, \nand it is maintained for the course-based MA students by requiring more courses. \nWhereas the thesis-based MA (thesis) degree is offered only full time, the course-based MA will be \noffered both full time and part time. All other academic progression requirements remain the same. \n5.3  Engaged and Active Learning / Delivery Methods \nInstructions:  In completing this section, please consult Council’s expectation with respect to engaged \nand active learning and standards for programs in blended/distributed/distance modes.  Responses \nshould focus on any differences relative to existing offerings.  \n5.3.1 Demonstrate the ways in which the institution identifies and attends to the learning of students \nin the program and what pedagogies will be used to encourage their engaged and active \nlearning, as per Council’s program quality assessment standard #5 (Program delivery). \nThis program will concentrate on areas of strength in the Department, Faculty and University. The \nparamount strength of the proposed course-based MA in the History of Art, Design and Visual \nCulture is the complement of faculty members who engage with recent scholarship and actively \npublish in the fields of art history, history of design and visual culture. These faculty members \nfocus on the visual and material culture of Europe, North America and East Asia from the \nsixteenth century to the present. Viewed together, these areas of faculty research enable the \ndivision to offer a coherent program of study. Courses based on these research areas are offered \nNew Program Proposal Part B1 – Campus Alberta Quality Council Review \nseminar-style, providing students with an engaged and active atmosphere in which to develop \nskills in critical reading, writing, and oral presentation. \nWhat distinguishes the University of Alberta in this program of study is the breadth of material \naddressed by this research: in addition to the traditional study of painting and sculpture offered \nby most art history departments, the History of Art, Design and Visual Culture makes the study \nof design, photography, the graphic arts, and museum practices a core component of its \ncurriculum. As such it is on the cutting edge of visual and material culture research and offers a \nprogram that is unique in Canada. Departmental strengths in Modern and Contemporary Art and \nDesign (including recent and existing Canada Research Chairs in Fine Arts and Design Studies) \nsupport the research and teaching of faculty members in HADVC. The thriving research culture \nof the Faculty of Arts encourages the kind of critical interdisciplinary thinking that marks \nadvanced university-based research programs.  \n5.3.2 Include a description of the teaching/learning approaches to be used, a description of the \nrationale for using the approach, and evidence of adequate support for the approach. Where \napplicable, demonstrate how CAQC’s Additional Quality Assessment Standards for Programs \nDelivered in Blended, Distributed or Distance Modes will be met. \nThe curriculum in the History of Art, Design and Visual Culture is linked to various forms of \nmodernity, attention to critical theory, and emphasis on the global exchange of material things \nand ideas. They are furthermore supported by excellent faculty in other departments, existing \nlibrary resources, and the visual collections held by the University of Alberta. The study of art at \nthe University is fostered by excellent collections of art and design, among them the Mactaggart \ncollection of rare Chinese paintings and textiles, the Print Study Centre, the Bruce Peel Special \nCollections Library, and the Rawlinson Rare Medical Books Collection. Graduate classes offer \nstudents advanced skills in critical reading, thinking and writing, and the opportunity to work \nwith original objects in these and other Alberta-based collections. The program does not make \nuse of blended, distributed or distance modes of teaching/learning. \n5.4  Program Comparison \nInstructions:  The amount of information provided on the exemplars or benchmarks used by the \ninstitution should be commensurate with the degree of change being proposed.  Please provide a \ncomparative analysis with similar programs offered elsewhere to help Council determine whether the \nproposed program meets national and international standards.  \n5.4.1 Provide a comparative analysis of the proposed program (curriculum, structure, admission \nrequirements, etc.) with similar programs offered elsewhere (if any), especially in Alberta and \nCanada (see sample table below). What process was used to determine which programs were \ndeemed to be the most comparable? Illustrate the similarities and differences. \nThere are no comparable programs in the prairie provinces of Alberta, Saskatchewan and Manitoba.  \nNew Program Proposal Part B1 – Campus Alberta Quality Council Review \nCarleton University offers two MA streams, one of which is called the “course-work stream;” their program is \nalmost identical to our proposed program. The University of Western Ontario also has two MA streams, one of \nwhich is course-based like this proposed program. The program at Western requires fewer credits (18 versus 24) \nand a language other than English (LOE), which may be satisfied through exam or additional courses. The \nprogram at the University of New Brunswick, which also offers two streams, also requires fewer credits and \nproficiency in French. All these programs require a capstone research project. \nThese schools were chosen because they are Canadian universities that offer, like the University of Alberta, a \nfull range of undergraduate and graduate programs (BA, MA and PhD). \nProgram component \n University of Alberta \nCarleton University  \nUniversity of Western \nOntario \nUniversity of New \nBrunswick* \nName of degree \nMA (course-based) in the \nHistory of Art, Design and \nVisual Culture \nMA in Art History \n(course-work stream) \nMA (course-based) in \nArt History \nMA in History (by \nCourse and Report) \nEntrance requirements \nApplicants must hold a four-\nyear degree, normally a \nBachelor of Arts degree, with a \nmajor in the History of Art or a \nclosely related subject.  \nThe minimum \nrequirement is an \nHonours bachelor’s \ndegree (or equivalent) \nin art history or a \nrelated discipline. \nApplicants must hold a \nBA Honours (or \nequivalent) with a \nminimum B+ standing, \nnormally in Art History \nor Visual Arts. \nApplicants must \nhold a BA, \nnormally in History, \nArt History or a \nrelated field. \nAreas of study / Curriculum  \nHistory of Art, Design and \nVisual Culture in Europe, \nNorth America, and East Asia \nfrom the early modern period \nto the present \nVisual culture and \ncritical approaches, \nengaging the dynamic \nnature of the discipline \nat the beginning of the \n21st century \nHistories and theories \nof art and visual culture \nCanadian history, \ninternational and \nmilitary history, \nwomen & gender \nhistory, early \nmodern history, and \nother fields based \non faculty research \ninterests and \nresources \nGraduation requirements \n21 credits in course-work; 3 \ncredit capstone paper; ethics & \nprofessional development (no \ncredit) \n4 credits (the \nequivalent of 24 \ncredits) in course-work; \nCarleton Art Forum (no \ncredit) \n18 credits in course-\nwork; 30-page research \npaper; reading \nproficiency in LOE \n15 credits; reading \nproficiency in \nFrench \nTotal credits 24 24 18 to 24 15 to 21 \n* At the University of New Brunswick, art and visual culture studies are offered through the Department of History. \n5.4.2 If a similar program is currently offered at the institution, compare the structure, admission \nrequirements and learning outcomes to the proposed program. If this is a conversion of an \nexisting program (e.g., conversion of an applied degree to a new degree program), provide a \ntable similar to the sample shown below.  \nInstructions:  Regardless of whether the example table below is used, the ways in which the \nstructure, admission requirements and learning outcomes of the proposed program differ from \nany similar program(s) offered at the institution must be clearly identified.  \nSeveral other departments within the Faculty of Arts offer comparable course-based MA degrees, although none \nof these focus on the visual arts and culture. The course-based MA in English and the course-based MA in \nHistory and are the closest to our proposal. These degree programs require, as will ours, 24 graduate level \nNew Program Proposal Part B1 – Campus Alberta Quality Council Review \ncourse weights, a capstone project (included as part of those 24 course weights), as well as an ethics and \nprofessional development requirements. Admission requirements are also similar. \n5.5  Other elements affecting quality \nNote any other relevant aspects of the proposed program that might affect quality (e.g., fast-tracking, \nindividual study, parts of the program to be offered in cooperation with another institution, etc.). \nNone identified. \nSECTION 6:  IMPLEMENTATION AND RESOURCES \n6.1  Program Implementation Plan \nProvide a program implementation plan by academic year (start to maturity) that includes any \nelements to be phased in (e.g., new academic staff hires, courses, minors, co-op option). If introduction \nof this program is dependent on a similar program being phased out, the implementation plan should \ninclude how both programs are being supported until the phase out and start up are completed. \nInstructions:  The focus should be on new courses and features, on integration of existing program \nelements and the plans for winding down existing offerings (if applicable) while preserving quality. \nThe only new course for this program is HADVC 900, which is independent supervision of the student capstone \nprojects. This course will be offered beginning the second term of program implementation. Individual faculty \nalready accommodate independent supervision of student projects every term, and we do not anticipate a \nsignificant workload impact on faculty as the number of students entering this program will be small. Assuming \nfive new students enter each year, each individual faculty member will be assigned to no more than one new \nstudent. No new academic staff hires will be necessary to accommodate this program. \nNo programs will be phased out. \n6.2  Staffing Plan \n6.2.1 Show how the number (head count and FTE), distribution and qualifications of teaching staff \nmeet Council’s requirements and the objectives of the program as a whole (as described in s. \n1.6 above). Include the academic staff expertise to be recruited, if new staff are contemplated. \nProvide summary information of current academic staff and new hires who will be teaching in \nthe proposed program in the following format (see sample table below). \nInstructions:  Whether you choose to complete the table below or use a narrative, provide \nevidence for an adequate core of appropriate faculty resources who carry responsibility for the \noverall quality and delivery of the program. \nCourses taught by academic staff by credential and specialization  \nThe faculty teaching classes to be taken by students in the course-based MA all hold the PhD in either art \nhistory of a related field. No new faculty hires are anticipated. Each of these faculty members constitutes \n1 person and 1 FTE, and each currently teaches (and will continue to teach) one graduate course per year. \nThese faculty members include: \nNew Program Proposal Part B1 – Campus Alberta Quality Council Review \nDr. M. Elizabeth Boone, PhD City University of New York (full professor): U.S. and Latin American art in \nthe 19th-and early 20th-centuries; transnational relations in Europe and the Americas; world’s fairs and \nthe politics of display \nDr Lisa Claypool, PhD Stanford University (associate professor): Chinese art and visual culture from the \nQing dynasty to now, with a focus on painting practice, urban art production, and the cultural politics of \ndisplay \nDr Walter Davis, PhD Ohio State University (associate professor): Late-imperial Chinese painting, prints, \nand calligraphy; 20th-century Chinese and Japanese art; modern Sino-Japanese artistic exchange \nDr Joan Greer, PhD Free University of Amsterdam (full professor): 19th- and early 20th-century European \nart and design; the convergence of the fine and applied arts; art and religion; sustainable design; \nconstructs of nature \nDr Steven Harris, PhD University of British Columbia (associate professor): Anti-formal tendencies in \n20th-century art; surrealism; avant-garde movements; postwar European art \nDr Natalie Loveless, PhD University of California, Santa Cruz (assistant professor): Contemporary art and \ntheory; feminist art and theory; visual, performance and cultural studies; practice-led research and \nresearch-creation in the arts  \nDr Lianne McTavish, PhD, Rochester University (full professor): Early modern visual culture, with a \nspecialization in images of health, healing, childbirth and anatomical dissection; history and theory of \nmuseums; contemporary fitness and bodybuilding culture  \nA list of courses offered may be found in Appendix A. CVs are available upon request. \n6.2.2 Include brief explanations of academic staff categories (e.g., continuing, sessional, term) and \nworkload expectations. \nInstructions:  Reference to an institutional document may suffice. \nAll faculty offering courses in this program are continuing faculty who teach a full load of courses (4 HCE) each \nyear. \n6.2.3 Provide a proposed teaching rotation that outlines the academic staff at launch and to maturity \nof the program (see sample table below) and shows clearly the plan for any cycling of courses. \nList also any non-academic staff who will teach in the program. \nInstructions: The focus should be on the aspects that provide coherence and structure to the \nproposed degree.  Demonstrate that the course rotation and staffing capacity are sufficient to \ndeliver the proposed program to a full-time student. \nThe course rotation listed below is based on the courses delivered during academic year 2015-2016 and 2016-\n17. The specific topics for HADVC 511 (Advanced Special Topics in Art, Design and Visual Culture) change \ndepending upon who teaches the course. The only classes that are cycled (repeated during years 1 and 2) are \nHADVC 600 (Theory & Methods, which is offered every fall) and HADVC 900 (Capstone, which will be \noffered every term). \nNew Program Proposal Part B1 – Campus Alberta Quality Council Review \nProposed teaching rotation for required courses in the major/specialization  \nFall Year 1 Instructor Winter Year 1 Instructor \nHADVC 600 McTavish HADVC 506 Boone \nHADVC 512 Davis HADVC 511 Loveless \nHADVC 555 Greer HADVC 511  Claypool \n*HADVC 900 All faculty HADVC 511 McTavish \n  HADVC 900 All faculty \nFall Year 2 Instructor Winter Year 2 Instructor \nHADVC 600 Boone HADVC 511 Harris \nHADVC 503 McTavish HADVC 512 Davis \nHADVC 556 Loveless HADVC 555 Greer \n*HADVC 900 All faculty HADVC 900 All faculty \nN.B.

Be sure their permission has been given. \nInstructions:  Normally not required for the type of proposal envisioned by the Part B1 template \nbut should be available upon request. \nCVs for all academic faculty teaching in this area are available on request. \n6.3  Scholarly and Creative Activity \nInstructions:  Reference to institutional documents should suffice for the level of change handled by \nthis document. \n6.3.1 Describe what constitutes scholarship and/or creative activity for academic staff teaching in this \nprogram, and summarize the institutional expectations of academic staff with respect to \nscholarship and professional development as well as how these are assessed. Describe plans for \nsupporting scholarly activities and professional development of academic staff (see Council’s \nexpectations regarding scholarship, research and creative activity in s. 3.7.3 of Council’s \nHandbook). \nNew Program Proposal Part B1 – Campus Alberta Quality Council Review \nThe paramount strength in the History of Art, Design and Visual Culture is the complement of faculty \nmembers who engage with recent scholarship and actively publish in the history of art, design \nand visual culture.  \nAll faculty actively disseminate their research and regularly obtain external research funding. Dr. M. \nElizabeth (Betsy) Boone, an expert in nineteenth and early twentieth-century U.S., Spanish and \nLatin American art, published her first monograph with Yale in 2007 and received SSHRC \nStandard Research Grant from 2010 to 2014 to complete her second one, which is currently \nunder review by a major academic publisher. Dr. Lisa Claypool has published book chapters, \nscholarly articles, and exhibition catalogues; she held a SSHRC Insight Development Grant \nfrom 2014 to 2016 and is currently a Senior Fellow at the Center for Advanced Study in the \nVisual Arts in Washington DC. Dr. Walter Davis, who studies Sino-Japanese relations in the \nearly twentieth century, has curated exhibitions and produced book essays; he is publishing his \nfirst book with Brill. Dr. Joan Greer publishes scholarly articles on constructions of artistic \nidentity and the relations between artistic and religious discourses in late nineteenth- and early \ntwentieth-century European art and design, with a focus on Holland and Belgium; she held a \nSSHRC Standard Research Grant from 2006 to 2010. Dr. Steven Harris is an expert in \nsurrealism, avant-garde movements and post-war European art, having published a book on \nSurrealist art and thought in the 1930s with Cambridge in 2004; he too held a SSHRC Standard \nResearch Grant from 2006 to 2010. Dr. Natalie Loveless is an artist and scholar who works on \nfeminist art and gender, performance, art as social practice, as well as psychoanalytic and \nliterary theory. She held a SSHRC Insight Connection Grant in 2016 and a SSHRC Insight \nDevelopment Grant from 2014 to 2016; her first book, on research-creation in the North \nAmerican university, has been submitted for publication. Dr. Lianne McTavish has produced \nrefereed articles on critical museum theory, nineteenth-century Canadian museums, and \nvisuality, in addition to her 2005 monograph on the visual culture of early modern childbirth, \nher 2013 book on the modern museum in Canada, and 2015 book on feminist body building; she \nhas received three SSHRC Standard Research Grants, the most recent of which is supporting \nresearch for a book on non-professional museums in Alberta.  \nAll faculty are evaluated annually by the Chair of their department and by a committee of their peers. \nThe University of Alberta provides ample support through workshops and internal funding \nopportunities for faculty preparing external grant applications. \n6.3.2 For doctoral proposals, include a tabular summary of research grants held by key academic \nstaff involved in the program, both (i) in aggregate form, and (ii) by academic staff member, \nyears of tenure of each grant, and source and amount of the grant. \nNot applicable. \n6.4  Physical and Technical Infrastructure \nDescribe the facilities, laboratory and computer equipment (as applicable) available to meet the \nspecialized demands of the program, as well as plans to address any deficiencies in what might be \nrequired. \nInstructions:  Normally not required unless the proposed program places substantial new demands on \ninfrastructure. \nNew Program Proposal Part B1 – Campus Alberta Quality Council Review \nThis program makes no new demands on infrastructure. \n6.5  Information Services \nProvide an inventory and analysis of information resources to support the program (using standard \nlibrary reference guides) and plans to deal with any deficiencies, and a description of student access to \nother information services. \nInstructions:  Normally not required unless the proposed program places substantial new demands on \ninformation services.  \nThis program makes no new demands on Information Services. A Library Impact Statement is \nincluded with this proposal as Appendix C. \nSECTION 7:  CONSULTATION AND ASSESSMENT \nInstructions:  Not all of the questions in Section 7 may be relevant to the proposed program.  \nComplete as appropriate, i.e., much of s. 7.1 might be addressed by reference to existing documents, \nand s. 7.2 should only be completed if it is relevant. With respect to 7.3, report(s) of external \nindependent academic experts are normally expected unless a compelling case is provided.  \n7.1  Program Evaluation \nDescribe the criteria and methods which will be used to ensure the ongoing quality of the program. \nInclude mechanisms for periodic review using external evaluation. Include the expected outcomes, key \nperformance indicators and performance targets for the program. \nThe University of Alberta performs regular periodic review of all its degree programs, and the course-\nbased MA will be evaluated at the same time as the other graduate programs in the Department \nof Art and Design. The success of the program will be evaluated based on admission and \nacceptance numbers, graduation rates, alumni employment, and external assessment by \nprofessionals in the field. The current cycle of review is every 5 to 7 years. \nNew Program Proposal Part B1 – Campus Alberta Quality Council Review \n7.2  Consultation / Accreditation or Regulatory Approval  \n7.2.1 Building on s. 2.3, outline the consultation that has occurred with other institutions, \norganizations or agencies, including advisory bodies formed by the applicant institution to \nassist in program design, implementation and evaluation. This should include, where \nappropriate, professional associations, regulatory agencies and/or accrediting bodies, and \nprospective employers. \nThe following independent academic experts beyond the University of Alberta’s Faculty of Arts have \nconsulted with us, provided feedback, and expressed support for this proposal:  \nDr. Kathryn Shailer, Acting Research Officer and Special Advisor for Graduate Studies and Internationalization, \nAlberta College of Art and Design \nDr. Kenneth Allen, Associate Professor of Art History, University of Lethbridge \nDr Anne Dymond, Associate Professor, Art History and Museum Studies, University of Lethbridge \nDr. Allan Gilliland, Dean, Faculty of Fine Arts, MacEwan University \nDean Smale, Coordinator of Visual Communications, Medicine Hat College \nJason Frizzell, Dean, School of Creative Arts, Red Deer College \nDr. Jia Wang, Acting Director, China Institute, University of Alberta \nDr. Randolph Wimmer, Interim Dean, Faculty of Education, University of Alberta \nIn addition, consultation with other organizations and prospective employers has resulted in letters of support \nfrom the following:  \nJacek Malec, Executive Director, Harcourt House Artist Run Centre, Edmonton \nDeborah Herringer Kiss, Director, Herringer Kiss Gallery, Calgary \nHeather Hamel, Director, Scott Gallery, Edmonton \nJanine Andrews, Executive Director, University of Alberta Museums, Edmonton \nChelsea Boida, Public Art Officer, Edmonton Arts Council \nThese letters are attached as Appendix B.  \n7.2.2 If the program is subject to accreditation or approval of a regulatory body, provide a \ndescription of the review process, requirements of the body and timing of the review (if in \nprocess). If possible, a chart or table may be useful to outline accreditation or regulatory \napproval requirements.  \nNot applicable. \n7.2.3 If not already covered in 7.2.2., indicate how graduates will meet professional or regulatory \nexpectations. \nNot applicable. \n7.3  Reports of Independent Academic Experts \nCAQC views external peer review, which can be both formative and summative, as foundational to \nensuring the quality of academic programs. In order to strengthen the proposal, before the proposal is \nfinalized, the institution should consult with one or more independent academic experts it selects from \nNew Program Proposal Part B1 – Campus Alberta Quality Council Review \noutside the institution to provide advice regarding all aspects of the program. The report(s) of these \nexternal independent academic experts should be provided, along with the institution’s response to the \nreport(s). If an institution wishes a program proposal to be exempted from the normal requirement of \nan assessment by an external expert, it must provide a compelling case as part of its request for a Fully \nExpedited Review. Short résumés of the academic experts involved and a rationale as to why they were \nselected should be provided (see CAQC’s guidelines with respect to the selection and use of \nIndependent Academic Experts in Appendix I of the CAQC Handbook).  \nSECTION 8:  OTHER \n8.1  Adverse Claims or Allegations  \nDisclose any adverse claims or allegations that might affect this application or be of concern to \nCouncil. \nNo known adverse claims or allegations affect this application. \n8.2  Statement of Institutional Integrity \nInclude a signed Statement of Institutional Integrity (see Council template on web site). \n8.3  Other documentation \nProvide any other supporting documents such as the Graduate Program Handbook, Faculty \nHandbook, current calendar, cyclical review of programs policy, etc. that would add support to the \napplicant’s case and would help reviewers (provide website links, if available). \nThe University of Alberta Graduate Program Handbook is available \nhere: https://www.ualberta.ca/graduate-studies/about/graduate-program-manual \nInformation about “Master’s Studies—Course-Based” at the University of Alberta is available \nhere: https://www.ualberta.ca/graduate-studies/current-students/masters-course-based \nThe University of Alberta Calendar is available here: http://calendar.ualberta.ca/ \nhttps://www.ualberta.ca/graduate-studies/about/graduate-program-manual\nhttps://www.ualberta.ca/graduate-studies/current-students/masters-course-based\nhttp://calendar.ualberta.ca/\nAppendix A.  \nPart I.

Prerequisite: consent of Department. \nThis course provides students with an introduction to theories and methodologies employed in \nthe study of art, design, and visual culture. Students examine a wide range of approaches, \ncovering both historical and contemporary materials and debates. \n+HADVC 503 Advanced Studies in Early Modern Art, Design and Visual Culture: The Early \nModern Body in Europe, 1450–1800 \n3 (fi 6) (either term, 0-3s-0). Prerequisite: consent of Department. \nScholars increasingly examine how early modern bodies were produced in a range of \nrepresentations, including literary texts, medical engravings, theatrical performances, and \nportraiture. The study of these bodies has become a distinctive field of inquiry, and this seminar \nintroduces students to its historiography, major debates, and dominant themes, with an emphasis \non visual articulations of the body. Students analyze, for example, the gendered rituals of \nanatomical dissection, the ways in which monstrous bodies communicated conceptions of self, \nsex, and “race,” and the social construction of disease. \n+HADVC 506 Advanced Studies in Art, Design and Visual Culture in the Early 20th Century:  \nMurals and Public Art in North America, 1910-1945  \n*3 (fi 6) (either term, 0-3s-0). Prerequisite: consent of Department. \nThis course examines murals and public art produced in Mexico, the United States, and Canada \nduring the 1920s, 30s and 40s. Readings explore work produced for the Mexican Mural \nMovement, as well as work produced in the United States and Canada. \nHADVC 511 Advanced Special topics in Art, Design and Visual Culture: Feminist Art and the \nMaternal  \n*3 (fi 6) (either term, 0-3s-0). Prerequisite: consent of Department. \nForty years after the intervention of feminist art, what is the experience of the daughters of that \nera who have since become mothers? How is that experience expressed in their artwork, and how \ndoes this artwork relate to the work being done in the 70s? This course draws upon a variety of \nacademic disciplines, including feminist theory, art history, and psychoanalysis, to study the \nmaternal in the context of feminism today. Reading of theoretical texts are interwoven with \nanalysis of historical and contemporary art practice. \n+HADVC 511 Advanced Special topics in Art, Design and Visual Culture: The History of \nMuseums  \n*3 (fi 6) (either term, 0-3s-0). Prerequisite: consent of Department. \nMuseums are no longer considered “neutral” spaces that simply preserve valuable objects for the \neducation and enjoyment of the public. Questions have been raised about the social function of \nmuseums: Do these institutions reinforce class distinctions? Do organized exhibition spaces \nguide the visitor through a narrative of national identity? Whose (hi)story is told in museums and \nwho gets to tell it? Who benefits, financially or otherwise, from museum exhibits? Students will \nanalyze different approaches to these questions by reading historical and theoretical texts about \nthe earliest cabinets of curiosities, the “universal survey museum” of the nineteenth century, and \ncontemporary organizations. Case studies are based on museums and display areas in Alberta, \nmostly local ones, with a few corresponding readings on these organizations. \nHADVC 511 Advanced Special topics in Art, Design and Visual Culture: Ӕsthetics and \nMateriality  \n*3 (fi 6) (either term, 0-3s-0). Prerequisite: consent of Department. \nIn this course, we investigate the renewed interest in æsthetics in recent years, in conjunction \nwith an investigation of those practices in the visual arts that foreground their materials. The \nfocus of the course is on the æsthetic thought of Jacques Rancière, Peter Osborne and others in \nits relation to artistic practice, but students first consider the modern history of æsthetics more \ngenerally, before turning to contemporary æsthetics and to examples of artistic practice —and \nthe thinking about it by artists, critics and— from the 1930s to the present. \nHADVC 512 Advanced Studies in Asian Art, Design and Visual Culture: Orthodoxy and \nEccentricity in Chinese Painting of the 17th and 18th Centuries \n*3 (fi 6) (either term, 0-3s-0). Prerequisite: consent of Department. \nThis seminar examines two of the most important artistic movements of China's Qing dynasty \n(1644-1911): the Orthodox School and the Yangzhou Eccentrics. In the 17th and 18th centuries, \nhighly placed scholar officials and painters at the Manchu court in Beijing espoused the creative \ntheories of Dong Qichang (1555-1636) and established an extremely conservative mode of \npainting that would dominate Chinese criticism and artistic practice for centuries. However, in \nChina’s leading eighteenth--century commercial centre, the southern city of Yangzhou, amateur \nand professional masters operated in a dramatically different environment, responding to novel \nsocial and economic developments with innovations what would challenge the strictures of \northodox painting and, in the modern era, contribute to its demise. Seminar sessions include \nfirsthand viewings of works in the university’s Mactaggart Art Collection. \nHADVC 512 Advanced in Asian Art, Design and Visual Culture: China’s Design Revolution  \n*3 (fi 6) (either term, 0-3s-0). Prerequisite: consent of Department. \nThis course raises the question: when will China stop manufacturing and start designing? After \nbriefly exploring the historical development of the modern factory system through the lens of \neducation, socio-economic development, lifestyle, the environment, and politics, students will \nstudy the dynamic new generations of designers emerging in China since the end of the Cultural \nRevolution in the late 1970s. Design will be examined in a broad compass: from fashion, cars, \ntoys and tea cups, to graphic design, design of mega events (the 2008 Beijing Olympics, the \n2010 Shanghai World Expo), and urban design and architecture. Students are not expected to \nhave any prior experience in Chinese Studies. \nHADVC 512 Advanced Studies in Asian Art, Design and Visual Culture: Traditionalist \nModernities of China and Japan \n*3 (fi 6) (either term, 0-3s-0). Prerequisite: consent of Department. \nThis seminar considers traditionalism in the art, design, and visual cultures of China and Japan in \nthe late-19th and early-20th centuries. We will examine how and why, as industrialization, \ncommercialization, colonialism, and nationalism profoundly reshaped East Asia, artists, \ndesigners, intellectuals, art-world organizers, businesspeople, and consumers related the visual, \nmaterial, and social realities of their modern era to ones of the past. By what means and to what \nends did they preserve, advance, and invent traditions? Focusing on painting and calligraphy but \nalso taking into account such modes of expression as architecture and fashion, we will \ninvestigate the articulation and practice of traditionalist art and design within such modern, \ntransnational contexts as artistic societies, exhibitions, department stores, publishing ventures, \nand museums. Seminar sessions will include discussions of readings, student reports, and \nviewings of primary objects and texts in the Mactaggart Art Collection and University of Alberta \nLibraries. \nHADVC 555 Advanced Studies in in Art, Design and Visual Culture in the Second Half of the \n19th Century: Visualizing “Nature”  \n*3 (fi 6) (either term, 0-3s-0). Prerequisite: consent of Department. \nIn this course students examine how “nature” was theorized and represented in the visual and \napplied arts from 1848-1914. On the one hand, this includes investigating Realist, Impressionist \nand Symbolist works focusing, in particular on landscape, botanical and zoological subject \nmatter. On the other, it includes nature motifs in Arts and Crafts and Art Nouveau design. How \nsuch representations relate to early environmental and scientific discourses are considered. \nTheories of the Anthropocene, Animal Studies and Environmental History also inform student \nenquiries. \nHADVC 555 Advanced Studies in in Art, Design and Visual Culture in the Second Half of the \n19th Century: Religion and Art (1848 – 1914)  \n*3 (fi 6) (either term, 0-3s-0). Prerequisite: consent of Department. \nThis seminar examines religion and art in the second half of the nineteenth and early twentieth \ncentury, focusing on Realist and Symbolist artistic production (primarily painting, sculpture, \nphotography and the graphic arts) in Europe and North America. \n+HADVC 556 Advanced Studies in in Art, Design and Visual Culture from the Mid-20th \nCentury to the Present: Ephemerality and Sustainability in Contemporary Art \n*3 (fi 6) (either term, 0-3s-0). Prerequisite: consent of Department. \nJames Lovelock, known for having co-created the Gaia hypothesis with Lynn Margulis, was \nrecently quoted as saying that “saving the planet is a foolish, romantic extravagance.” This \ncourse will examine how perspectives such as Lovelock's reorient artistic production in the 21st \ncentury, with particular attention to debate surrounding the so-called ‘anthropocene.’ The \nanthropocene, as a political term, has increasingly found itself at the center of contemporary \ndiscourse in the arts, with numerous books, exhibitions, articles and journals devoted to it. \nReadings will examine contemporary debates surrounding the anthropogenic climate change and \nexamine the impact of such debates on art practice and scholarship. Students are expected to \nengage with the course “research-creationally,” bringing scholarly attention to arts practice and \nartistic attention to academic scholarship. \nHADVC 900 Directed Research Project \n*3 (fi 6) (either term, unassigned).  \nStudents enrolled in this capstone course work independently with a supervisor to develop a \nresearch topic of their choosing. \n1407 14TH AVENUE N.W. \nCALGARY, ALBERTA   \nCANADA, T2N 4R3 \nT: (403) 284-7600 \nF: (403) 289-6682 \nWWW.ACAD.CA \nFebruary 21, 2017 \nDr. M.

The program as described fills a long \noverdue need for a flexible Master’s program that complements a studio-based degree (MFA, MDes) with greater depth \nof understanding historical contexts, visual analysis, and research methods, as well as enhanced development of the \nclear expression of ideas in written and oral formats.  This program fills a particular niche for students who have no \ndesire to proceed to a PhD program, as well as teachers and practitioners who would benefit from these skill sets – a \nniche that no other university in the prairie provinces currently caters to.  The pairing of this program with an MFA or \nMDes should be particularly attractive to those seeking careers in the post-secondary sector. \nFrom a purely practical point of view, it makes complete sense for the University of Alberta’s History of Art, Design \nand Visual Culture division (Department of Art and Design) to offer this course-based program in tandem with its \nthesis-based MA and thesis-based PhD programs.  No new courses are required and I’m prepared to believe the \nexisting faculty complement can manage the few (2-5) additional students each year.   The benefits of adding this \nprogram clearly outweigh any additional costs. \nWe would be happy to bring this program, once approved, to the attention of our MFA graduates and faculty. \nSincerely, \nKathryn Shailer, PhD \nActing Chief Research Officer and \n  Special Advisor for Graduate Studies and Internationalization \nmailto:Betsy.boone@ualberta.ca\nmailto:lmctavis@ualberta.ca\nDr Steven Harris \nActing Chair, Department of Art and Design \nUniversity of Alberta \n3-98 Fine Arts Building \nEdmonton, AB T6G 2C9 \nRE: Course-based MA in the History of Art, Design and Visual Culture \nDear Steven Harris, \nI am writing in support of a new course-based MA in the History of Art, Design and \nVisual Culture at the University of Alberta. M. Elizabeth (Betsy) Boone emailed me the \nsummary of proposal for this new course and I think it’s fantastic and much needed!  \nI feel like the Canadian arts community loses a lot of art historians to other countries \nwhere Masters degrees in art history are offered and while we many will still want to \nstudy abroad, it is wonderful for those you can not to have an option here in Alberta. My \nonly regret is that I won’t be able to take advantage of this program myself.  I certainly \nwould have when I was younger. \nI wish you the best of luck with this new program and hope that you will keep me up to \ndate with your progress in getting it started! \nBest regards, \nDeborah Herringer Kiss \nDirector, Herringer Kiss Gallery \nDepartment of Art \n4401 University Drive \nLethbridge, Alberta, Canada \nT1K 3M4 \nPhone  403.394.3997 \nFax  403.382.7127 \nwww.uleth.ca/finearts \nJanuary 30, 2017 \nDr. Steven Harris, Acting Chair \nDepartment of Art and Design \nUniversity of Alberta \n3098 Fine Arts Building \nEdmonton, AB T6G 2C9 \nDear Dr. Steven Harris, \nAs an Associate Professor of Art History at the University of Lethbridge, I am writing a letter of \nsupport for the Department of Art and Design’s excellent new proposal for a course-based MA in \nthe History of Art, Design and Visual Culture division. The proposed MA appears to be a fine \ncomplement to the thesis-based MA already in place. \nThe courses that would be available to students (in terms of current offerings) are wide-ranging, \nwith an interesting temporal and geographic reach that address the evolving demographics of \nAlberta. The two additional courses that may be taken outside of HADVC cover a useful number \nof area studies appropriate to the students’ interests and frames of reference. It is suggested that \nthere are additional possibilities for outside courses, and I would hope that philosophy would be \none of those areas due to the close relationship between aesthetics and art analysis. \nI was interested to see that the capstone element of the course-based MA is very similar to the \ncourse-based MA that I took myself at York University. Although I did go on to pursue a \nresearch-based PhD at the University of Toronto, I found the research paper option to be more \nsuitable than an MA thesis and defence. It allowed more freedom to pursue my own research \ninclinations at the time than would have the stricter protocols of the thesis and defence option.  \nThe proposed learning outcomes for the course-based MA are substantial and essential for a full \nengagement with art history and visual culture. I could not agree more with these aims and the \nresulting benefits for students. \nSection 5 of Learning Outcomes, concerning the practical professional skills developed in the \nPro-Seminar, is particularly valuable given the nature of this program and the students to whom \nit is directed. Making this program more accessible and practical (with its part-time study option) \nto community members who may wish to upgrade their skills and knowledge is very useful. It \nwould allow students to continue with their professional lives outside of the university, while at \nthe same time furthering their studies. This provides greater services and access to the \ncommunity and potentially brings students into the University of Alberta who might not \notherwise attend. \nThe course-based MA program appears to be well conceived for current secondary school art \nteachers who may wish to upgrade their skills. The furthering of their studies could in turn assist \nin raising the standards of art education in the Alberta school system. The same is true of those \nindividuals already working in cultural institutions who wish to continue their art-related \neducation. \nWith the current challenging economic conditions in Alberta, it is important to note that this \nprogram can be assimilated into already existing courses using current faculty. The number of \nstudents anticipated to take such a degree is reasonable and appears to be in line with the \nregional market for employment afterward. \nIt is valuable for the various art departments in Alberta to have good options for our students \nwho wish to engage in graduate study in their home province and region. The proposed \ndevelopment of this course-based MA program in the University of Alberta’s History of Art, \nDesign and Visual Culture division is therefore an important development, not only for \nEdmonton, but also for the province and region.  \nSincerely, \nKenneth R.

As an Associate Professor of Art History and Museum Studies at the \nUniversity of Lethbridge, I am well aware of the strong interest from diverse students to continue studies \nin the province.  \nThe proposed program of study will answer a provincial need. It will provide opportunities for a select \nnumber of applicants who are not currently being served by existing programs in the province, which \ncater to those planning to pursue a doctorate. This course-based MA degree will allow students who do \nnecessarily want to pursue a PhD the opportunity to enrich their studies. I believe the part-time \ncomponent of the program will be particularly valuable to those who already work in related fields and \nwant to deepen their knowledge.  \nThe course work and capstone project will allow students a rigorous engagement in advanced art \nhistorical studies. It also provides an excellent balance of breadth and depth. I wholeheartedly support \nthe development of this new program.  \nIf I can do anything to further support the program, please don’t hesitate to get in touch with me.  \nSincerely,  \nAnne Dymond \nAnne Dymond, Ph.D., \nAssociate Professor, Art History and Museum Studies \nUniversity of Lethbridge, Lethbridge AB \nT1K 3M4   \nanne.dymond@uleth.ca \n403 380 1853 \nmailto:anne.dymond@uleth.ca\nJanuary 31, 2017 \nThis letter is written in support of The University of Alberta’s Department of Art and Design’s proposal for an \nMA in the History of Art, Design and Visual Culture. \nTheir proposal for a one-year degree is well thought out and addresses the needs of community members, \nteachers and students. The option to complete the degree in either one year, or part-time over many years will \nmake it appealing to those already working in the industry that are seeking to expand their credentials. The in-\ndepth course list is well thought out and will attract students from a variety of backgrounds. I especially like \nthe idea for a capstone course, which will give students the opportunity to engage in a substantial research \nproject. The fact that the research topic can be in an area of their interest will make it all the more meaningful.  \nI have spoken to the Design and Fine Art faculty here at MacEwan University and they enthusiastically \nendorse this proposal. They are especially happy to see another opportunity in Edmonton for our students to \npursue graduate school.  \nThe Department of Art and Design looks perfectly positioned to offer this new MA. They clearly have the \ndepth of faculty, resources and facilities to achieve their goals, and the fact that it will require no new resources \nor fees, makes it all the more appealing. \nI wholeheartedly support this proposal and wish the faculty all the best as they move forward.

Adding this \nspecific degree seems to be a logical addition to the existing menu of course-based MA \ndegrees. \nOverall I believe this is a program that increases the number of pathways and opportunities \nfor students studying art and art history to achieve a graduate level credential. The multiple \npathways into the degree and broad audience are a particularly unique strength of the \nproposal. I believe individuals who currently hold studio-based MFA may see this as a \nmeans of gaining a competitive advantage for highly sought after faculty positions. \nFurthermore, the ability to complete the credential through part-time studies is respectful of \nindividuals who are seeking advancement but cannot commit to a full-time program. Finally, \nthe small size of the anticipated cohort and the ability to deliver the program within existing \nresources and expertise makes the proposal a fairly easy sell. \nRed Deer College supports the proposed degree and views it as a viable option for our \nstudents in both BFA and BA University Transfer streams. \nThank you for the opportunity to provide this letter of support. Please do not hesitate to \ncontact me directly if you require further commentary or clarification. \nJason Frizzell \nDean \nSchool of Creative Arts \n1 \nFebruary 15, 2017 \nDr. Steven Harris \nActing Chair \nDepartment of Art and Design \nUniversity of Alberta \nEdmonton, AB \nRe: Letter of support for a proposed course-based MA in the History of Art, Design and Visual Culture. \nDear Dr. Harris: \nAfter carefully reading the summary proposal forwarded by Dr. M. Elizabeth Boone, I am pleased to \nwrite a letter of support for a proposed, course-based MA in the History of Art, Design and Visual \nCulture. \nIn December 2012, I purchased Scott Gallery and made the transition from a 14-year employment with \nthe Art Gallery of Alberta (AGA) as the manager of AGA Art Rental and Sales. My professional life as a \nmanager and now as a gallerist within the art market, offers a perspective from one of the boundaries \nbetween a visual arts community and the general public. To that end, I am interested in an educational \nprogram that through its mandate and proposed, flexible timeframe encourages access by the broader \ncommunity. \nI believe that a thriving visual culture within a local context (and beyond) includes active and vital \neducational institutions; publicly funded galleries and artist-run centres; and, commercial galleries that \nbelieve in and reflect the cultural production of that community.  The flexible degree option (with a \ndifferential from an academic, thesis-based MA) is reasonable. Community members such as \ncommercial gallery directors, cultural workers in the private and public galleries, teachers, etc. who are \nalready committed to long-range projects, could more easily access further learning through such a \nprogram.  \nI would like to draw a parallel in effect to the general trend in interdisciplinary studies; specifically those \nprojects that include visual artists within a research group of other academics. It is the knowledge-\nsharing between different participants across specializations that I feel is the important action. I \nrecognize that the course-based MA in question, would draw a student body from within the visual arts, \nbut the action is still a lateral one outside the closed loop of the academic track. The learning outcomes \nas listed in the summary and the FGSR Ethics Professional Development requirement are achievable \ngoals and applicable to the work-life of community members.  \n2 \nMany professionals within the visual arts do strive to persuade their publics to engage more complexly \nwith the cultural production of their communities. I have worked to improve my understanding of art in \ngeneral and I have observed its effects on the general audience when I have the knowledge and \nconfidence to both show and explain. Having an institution like the University of Alberta consider such a \nflexible program of study as a course-based MA in Art History, Design and Visual Culture is a necessary \nand worthy development. \nSincerely, \nHeather Hamel \nDirector  \nScott Gallery \n10411-124 Street NW \nEdmonton, AB \nT5N 3Z5 \nFebruary 24, 2016 \nDr Steven Harris \nDepartment of Art and Design \nUniversity of Alberta  \n3-98 Fine Arts Building \nEdmonton, AB T6G 2C9 \nDear Dr Steven Harris, \nIt was brought to my attention by Betsy Boone that there are plans to add a course-\nbased MA to the graduate offerings in the History of Art, Design and Visual Culture at \nthe University of Alberta.  This sounds like a useful and intriguing way to diversify the \nofferings of your department.  \nAs a past student of your department, and your classes, I have an appreciation for the \nrigors of art history research and writing. However, those rigors are not necessarily \nhow I engage in art, or envision my future developments in art. Indeed, I had never \nconsidered a thesis-based MA or PHD, because I do not think of myself as an \nacademic. As a public art project manager who desires professional development, I \nseek to upgrade my knowledge of contemporary art and its place in (art) history. This \ncourse based MA sounds like a manageable way to do so while I retain my current \nemployment.  \nIf this course-based MA in the HADVC progresses from a plan into an offering, please \nsend me more information. I would seriously consider enrolling, especially if studio \ncourses are included in the eligible courses.  \nSincerely,  \nChelsea Boida \nPublic Art Officer \np: 780.424.2787 ext [229] \ne: cboida@edmontonarts.ca \n10440-108 Avenue \nEdmonton, AB CA T5H 3Z9  \npublicart.edmontonarts.ca \nLetter of Support \nCourse Based MA   \nARTS-CCRF-9-00-1 \nFACULTY OF ARTS \nCALENDAR CHANGE REQUEST FORM \nDepartment: Art & Design \n   DEADLINE \nImplementation:  NORMAL \n  EARLY (Note: new course offerings only) October 15 * \nType of Change:  Program Regulation March 1* \n  New Course  Course Change April 15* \n  Course Deletion   Editorial April 15  \n*Documentation is required to verify that other units in the Faculty of Arts (or other Faculties) offering similar courses have no objection \nto the proposed new course or course change, and to avoid challenges.

Two options for flow of the \nprogram are proposed – start in the PhD or start in the MScPT. \nThe Impact of the Proposal is The physical therapy profession continues to lack PhD trained clinician-\nscientists to carry out clinically relevant research to advance the \nprofession. Such individuals are essential for the profession to explore \nnew and effective interventions for our clients, and maintain the quality of \ntraining for new clinicians at the universities. The implementation of the \nMScPT Entry-level Program in 2003 has further diminished the number \nof physical therapists entering research, partly because of the very long \ntime frame of education (i.e., 4 years of undergraduate studies, 2.5 years \nPT professional training, 4-5 years of PhD training). We will address this \nissue by implementing an MScPT/PhD combined training program, in an \neffort to make it more attractive for highly promising individuals partly by \nreducing the total number of years required for such a qualification. \nReplaces/Revises (eg, policies, \nresolutions) \nn/a \nTimeline/Implementation Date Effective immediately upon final approval \nEstimated Cost and funding \nsource \nThere are no resource implications of this program because both \nprograms already exist and are resourced.

Post-Secondary Learning Act (PSLA): The PSLA gives GFC \nresponsibility, subject to the authority of the Board of Governors, over \nacademic affairs (Section 26(1)). Further, the PSLA gives the Board of \nGovernors authority over certain admission requirements and rules \nrespecting enrolment (Section 60(1)(c) and (d)). The Board has \ndelegated its authority over admissions requirements and rules  \nrespecting enrolment to GFC. GFC has thus established an Academic \nStandards Committee (ASC). \n2. PSLA: GFC may make recommendations to the Board of Governors \non a number of matters including the budget and academic planning \n(Section 26(1)(o)). GFC delegates its power to recommend to the Board \non the budget and on new or revised academic programs to the GFC \nAcademic Planning Committee (APC). \n3. PSLA: The PSLA gives Faculty Councils power to “provide for the \nadmission of students to the faculty” (29(1)(c)). \n4. PSLA: The PSLA gives Faculty Councils the authority to “determine \nthe programs of study for which the faculty is established” (Section \n29(1)(a)); to “provide for the admission of students to the faculty” \n(Section 29(1)(c)); and to “determine the conditions under which a \nstudent must withdraw from or may continue the student’s program of \nstudies in a faculty” (Section 29(1)(d)). \n5. UAPPOL Admissions Policy: “Admission to the University of Alberta \nis based on documented academic criteria established by individual \nFaculties and approved by GFC. These criteria may be defined in areas \nsuch as subject requirements, minimum entrance averages, and \nlanguage proficiency requirements. In addition to academic requirements \nfor admission, GFC authorizes each Faculty to establish such other \nreasonable criteria for admission of applicants as the Faculty may \nconsider appropriate to its programs of study, subject to the approval of \nGFC (e.g. interview, audition, portfolio, etc.) \nThe admission requirements for any Faculty will be those approved by \nGFC as set forth in the current edition of the University Calendar. In \naddition to the admission requirements, selection criteria for quota \nprograms, where they exist, will also be published in the current edition \nItem No. 5 \nGFC ACADEMIC PLANNING COMMITTEE \nFor the Meeting of November 8, 2017 \nof the University Calendar. \nThe responsibility for admission decisions will be vested in the Faculty \nAdmission Committees or in the Deans of the respective Faculties, as \nthe councils of such Faculties will determine.” \n6. GFC Academic Standards Committee (ASC) Terms of Reference \n(Mandate): The Office of the Provost and Vice-President (Academic) \nhas determined that the proposed changes are substantial in nature. \nASC’s terms of reference provide that “the term ‘substantial’ refers to \nproposals which involve or affect more than one Faculty or unit; are part \nof a proposal for a new program; are likely to have a financial impact; \nrepresent a definite departure from current policy; involve a quota; \narticulate a new academic concept\" (3.A.ii). \nFurther, “ASC provides advice or recommends to the GFC Academic \nPlanning Committee (APC) on proposals which involve substantial \nchange to admission/transfer regulations or academic standing.\" (3.B.iv) \n7. GFC Academic Planning Committee (APC) Terms of Reference \n(Mandate/Establishment/Termination of Academic Programs): \n“NOTE: APC deals with major program matters; minor program matters \nare dealt with through the GFC-mandated course/program approval \nprocess. The Provost and Vice-President (Academic) decides what is \nmajor or minor. \na.

What is the rationale for the program proposal? \nThe physical therapy profession continues to lack PhD trained clinician-scientists to carry out clinically relevant \nresearch to advance the profession.  Such individuals are essential for the profession to explore new and \neffective interventions for our clients, and maintain the quality of training for new clinicians at the universities.  \nThe implementation of the MScPT Entry-level Program in 2003 has further diminished the number of physical \ntherapists entering research, partly because of the very long time frame of education (i.e., 4 years of \nundergraduate studies, 2.5 years PT professional training, 4-5 years of PhD training).  We will address this \nissue by implementing an MScPT/PhD combined training program, in an effort to make it more attractive for \nhighly promising individuals partly by reducing the total number of years required for such a qualification.  \nThere are currently 2 other similar programs in the country – Western University (Ontario) and University of \nBritish Columbia – both reporting excellent application rates, suggesting considerable interest from the \nstudents. \n11. Provide the expected enrolment (or other) impact on the academic unit(s) offering the program and other affected \nunits if applicable. Include information on the current enrolment.  \nWe expect to enroll a maximum of 2 new students each year. Students in the combined program will be included \nin the regular MScPT cohort – there will not be additional spots held for combined students. There will be no \nimpact on other units. There is sufficient capacity amongst faculty members in physical therapy to supervise the \nstudents in the combined program (i.e., for their research work).  \n12. Do you anticipate an enrolment (or other) impact on programs at other institutions or regulatory bodies?  Describe \nany consultations that have occurred with other institutions and professional organizations. \nThe addition of a program in Alberta will not have an impact on the other existing combined degree programs in \nCanada. A combined program will be an option for students in Alberta who wish to combine a clinical and a \nresearch degree. \nThere are two existing MScPT/PhD programs currently in Canada – one at Western University and the other at \nUBC. Another, at McMaster University, is slated to accept its first students in Fall 2017 (http://srs-\nmcmaster.ca/news/new-dual-option-otpt-phd-program/).  We have communicated with both existing programs to \nlearn about their experiences. The program at Western University is longstanding – they have 27 students either \nin progress or complete and applications each year have ranged from 4-11.  UBC offers a newer combined \nprogram and have seen applications range from 0-5 in their first three years. We have also discussed the program \nwith one of the graduates of the Western program and have learned more about the successes and challenges \nof a combined program. One of the primary recommendations was to ensure that PhD supervisors of students \nin the combined program be well aware of the demands of both programs to ensure student success.  \n13. Are there any resource implications (budget, information technology (IT), library (Library Impact Statement), \nlaboratory, space, student services, administrative services (eg, FGSR, Registrar’s Office, or IST), as applicable) \nfor the proposed change? If so, please provide detail and evidence of consultation with affected unit(s) and/or \nappropriate University officers/committees. \nThere are no resource implications of this program because both programs already exist and are resourced.  \nStudents in the program will be assessed doctoral program fees for the entire program. Non-instructional fees are \nassessed at the rates in effect at the time, as approved by the Board of Governors. Students enrolled in the combined \nMScPT/PhD program will not have the option of transferring to the MScPT program or the PhD Rehabilitation Sciences \nprogram. \nAppendix – Sample Enrolment Table  \nProposed Enrolment 2016-17 2017-18 2018-19 2019-20 \n2020-21 Annual \nOngoing \n Total Full-Time head count 2 4 6 8 10  \n Full-Time Year 1 2 2 2 2 2 2  \n Full-Time Year 2  2 2 2 2 2  \n Full-Time Year 3   2 2 2 2  \n Full-Time Year 4    2 2 2  \n Full –Time Year 5     2 2  \n Total Part-Time head count 0 0 0 0  0 \n Part-Time Year 1       \n Part-Time Year 2       \n Part-Time Year 3       \n Part-Time Year 4       \n Total Work Experience hc 0 0 0 0  0 \n Work Experience Year 1       \n Work Experience Year 2       \n Work Experience Year 3       \n Work Experience Year 4       \n Anticipated Number of \nGraduates \n     2/yr starting \n2021 \n Appendices related to Question 8 – Internal Program Proposal Template MScPT PhD combined degree \n1 \nThe combined MScPT/PhD program brings together two programs to achieve efficiencies that help \nexceptional students seamlessly complete combined clinical and research studies. Each year, two seats \nwill be held for student admissions into the combined MScPT/PhD program.  If fewer than 2 suitable \ncandidates are available, the position may be taken by an MScPT student (enrolled in the first year of \ntheir clinical program).  The program is expected to take between 5-6 years to complete. \nRequirements for acceptance into program \n In order to be accepted in the combined MScPT/PhD program, students must meet the \nadmission requirements (GPA, interview, prerequisites) of both programs. The GPA \nrequirements of the MScPT are usually about 3.5.  \n Students must identify a faculty member who is willing to supervise their program, prior to their \nadmission (or early in the first year of the MScPT).   \nFlow of Program \nTwo options for flow of the program are proposed – start in the PhD or start in the MScPT (see Table 1).  \nThis is similar to the approach taken by the program at UBC, where both options exist (see \nhttp://physicaltherapy.med.ubc.ca/programs/.) By contrast, Western University offers one option – to \nstart in the PhD. (see http://uwo.ca/fhs/hrs/programs/combined.html). The advantage and \ndisadvantages of each route is as follows, . Starting in the PhD (i.e., PhD Start in Table) allows the \nstudent to do the foundational research work prior to starting in the clinical program, which tends to \nhave more rigid timetabling. The flow of the research studies, however, is interrupted by the clinical \nprogram.  This could work if the thesis was planned as a series of independent studies, which are not \ntime sensitive.  Starting the clinical program first (i.e., MScPT Start in Table) runs the risk that a student \nmight abandon the PhD portion of the program once the clinical portion is completed.  The advantage of \nthis sequence, however, is that it allows the student to develop their clinical research questions more \neffectively so that as they plan their research work. Subsequently, there is greater understanding of \nclinical practice and potentially relevant research questions that impact clients.  With the proposed \nprogram at the University of Alberta, flexibility will be allowed and considered on a case-by-case basis. \nTiming of the candidacy will be built into the program, so that it occurs at the logical time for the \nparticular program rather than the current regulations of the PhD program, which is no later than the 3rd \nyear of the PhD program. It is possible that the student will need an additional ½ to 1 year to complete \nthe requirements for both programs (up to 6 years). See also detailed flow of program below.  Space will \nbe reserved in the MScPT program for students in the combined program irrespective of the student’s \nstarting stream i.e. PhD or MScPT. The MScPT program will ensure adequate access to clinical \nplacements for students who begin with the PhD. The facilities in Edmonton and our satellite sites have \nthe capacity for a small number (i.e., 2) of students in addition to our full enrolment and will \naccommodate those in the combined program.   \nhttp://physicaltherapy.med.ubc.ca/programs/\nhttp://uwo.ca/fhs/hrs/programs/combined.html\n Appendices related to Question 8 – Internal Program Proposal Template MScPT PhD combined degree \n2 \nTime PhD first MScPT first \nYear 1 PhD course work/research MScPT \nYear 2 PhD research MScPT \nYear 3 MSc PT PhD course work/research \nYear 4 MScPT PhD research \nYear 5 PhD research/MSc clinical PhD research/MSc clinical \nYear 6 (if needed) PhD Research/Clinical placement PhD Research/clinical placement \nTable 1. Outline of Flow of Combined Degree \nCourse Work \n Students will complete all academic and clinical requirements of both programs, with \nefficiencies proposed to integrate common content from each program (see below). Required \ncourses in the PhD Rehabilitation Medicine program are listed in the calendar and include 18 \ncredit units (Rehab 600, 601, 603 at least one advanced statistics course, and 6 credit unit \nelectives). Required courses in the MScPT (96 credit units) are as listed in the calendar.  \n Proposed efficiencies for students in the combined MScPT/PhD program \no THESIS 900 fulfils the research requirement including that contained in PTHER 900 (a \ncourse based,  group work activity related to evidence based decision making that \nincludes both a written paper and individual oral exam) \no REHAB 603 (entitled Seminars in Rehabilitation Science) is a course that addresses \nfoundational skills of researchers including library and data management skills, practice \nof presentation skills (oral, poster, written, powerpoint or other), writing (for awards, \nresearch proposals), and introduces concepts around knowledge translation. These \nconcepts are addressed in the first two evidence based practice courses in the MScPT \nprogram (PTHER 572 and 573 – Basic and Applied Concepts in Evidence Based Practice), \nand the three professional issues courses in the MScPT program (PTHER 524, 525, 526). \nFor these reasons, we propose that MScPT/PhD students be exempt from taking Rehab \n603.  \no PTHER 574 is the third in the Evidence Based practice series and covers advanced \nconcepts in Evidence based practice including measurement of clinical effectiveness \nsuch as program evaluation and quality improvement. For MScPT/PhD students for \nwhom these research areas are especially pertinent, we propose that they be able to \nuse this course to fulfil one of the elective requirements of the Rehab Science portion of \nthe combined program. For the remaining students, we propose that they be exempt \nfrom taking PTHER 574 and use the elective requirement in the Rehab Science program \nto take a course directly applicable to their research project. This flexible approach \nallows the student to take courses that are most applicable to their individualized \nresearch program, while achieving efficiencies in time for program completion.  \no One of the 6 week clinical placements in the clinical program can be research based, \nprovided other clinical education requirements are met.  \no Students in the MScPT program must complete three credits of elective course work. \nFor the students combined MScPT/PhD program we propose that the 3 credits of \n Appendices related to Question 8 – Internal Program Proposal Template MScPT PhD combined degree \n3 \nelective course work be dedicated to research activities related to the student’s doctoral \nresearch project (i.e., they would take a research elective, which is an elective that is \nalso open to student who are not in the combined program). \nResidency  \nThe seats for the MScPT/PhD program are located in Edmonton. This allows maximal contact with \nresearchers and fellow graduate students (both clinical and research).  \nDetailed Flow of Program (Note: individual variability is expected) \n Appendices related to Question 8 – Internal Program Proposal Template MScPT PhD combined degree \n4 \nStream PhD Start MScPT Start \nYear 1 \nFall \nRehab 600, 601, \nStats \nAnatomy (August) \nBlock 1 course work \nWinter PTHER 572, research elective Block 2 course work  \nSpring/Summer PTHER 573 (option to take here \nor next summer), Thesis/Project \nwork \nBlock 3 placement and coursework, 3* \nresearch elective/independent study \nYear 2  \nFall \nPTHER 899/900 (in lieu of thesis if \nrequired), elective if needed, \nThesis \nBlock 4 course work \nWinter Candidacy Block 5 content minus PTHER 574 EBP III \nunless elective \nSpring/Summer Candidacy/Thesis till August \nPTHER 516 (Anatomy) \nPTHER 521 (Research placement) \nBlock 5 coursework  \nPTHER 899/900 individual in lieu of thesis \nThesis  \nYear 3 \nFall  \nBlock 1 course work Rehab 600, 601, \nStats \nWinter Block 2 Coursework (minus 572), \nresearch work in lieu of 572 \n1 methodological/stats courses, elective \ncourse work \nSpring Summer Block 3 course work (minus 573, \nif taken above) \nPlacement, 3 * research \nelective/independent study \nThesis/Project work \nYear 4 \nFall \nBlock 4 course work PTHER 900 ( completed through thesis \nwork), Thesis \nWinter Block 5 content including PTHER \n574 EBP III if used as elective \nCandidacy ( this is in Year 4 which would \nrequire an exception to the timetable for \ncandidacy mandated by FGSR)  \nSpring Summer PTHER 521 (Research placement) \nBlock 5 coursework minus PTHER \n900 \nThesis  \nCandidacy/Thesis  \nYear 5  \nFall \nThesis Thesis \nWinter Thesis Thesis \nSpring/Summer Defense Defense \nYear 6  \nFall \nPlacements – PTHER 522/523 \nPTHER 901 OSCE \nPROGRAM COMPLETION \nPlacements – PTHER 522/523 \nPTHER 901 OSCE \nPROGRAM COMPLETION \nSept 19, 2017 \n2017-2018 University of Alberta Calendar Graduate Program Changes: proposed MScPT/PhD combined \nprogram in Physical Therapy and the Faculty of Rehabilitation Medicine \nCurrent Proposed \nPhysical Therapy \nNEW \nThe MScPT/PhD Combined Program \nThe Department of Physical Therapy and the \nFaculty of Rehabilitation Medicine offer a \nprogram of combined study which permits \nhighly qualified students to earn both the MSc \nin Physical Therapy and the PhD in \nRehabilitation Sciences after five years of \nfulltime study. \nProspective students will apply to the \nMScPT/PhD combined program and must \nmeet the entrance requirements of both \nprograms. Students have the option of starting \nin the clinical MScPT program or in the PhD \nprogram and the possible flow of the program \nis described on the Rehabilitation Medicine \nwebsite.  \nApplications will be reviewed by both the \nMScPT Admissions committee and the \nRehabilitation Science PhD Program \nCommittee.  Admission will be recommended \nonly for those students judged to have the \nability and motivation to handle the \nsignificant demands of the combined \nprogram.

This 2016-17 MNIF report is the first annual report under the new MNIF                 \nstructure. \nPurpose​ ​of​ ​Report \nThe University agreed to provide to representatives of the Students’ Union and Graduate Students’              \nAssociation an annual report on the total revenues generated through MNIFs and the related expenses. The                \nunits that provide the student services supported by MNIFs have prepared the following services summaries.               \nThe financial charts prepared by each unit outline the total expenditures for the particular service, other                \n(external) revenues received by the unit for this service, the amount of MNIF revenue allocated to this service                  \nand the net difference. A negative number indicates that the service requires support from University               \noperating​ ​funds.  \nType​ ​of​ ​Mandatory​ ​Non-Instructional​ ​Fees \nThe University has three mandatory non-instructional fees (MNIFs): the Athletics and Recreation fee, the              \nStudent Health & Wellness Fee and the Student Academic Support Fee. Appendix 1 in the Terms of Reference                  \nlists​ ​the​ ​student​ ​services​ ​supported​ ​by​ ​these​ ​fees.  \nAdditional​ ​Comments \nThe University is a highly complex and decentralized organization with budget responsibility delegated to the               \nunit level. Therefore, once a unit receives revenue for its operating budget, that unit has the capacity to                  \nallocate those resources in a manner that is within their overall budget and in response to unit objectives and                   \nthe​ ​priorities​ ​of​ ​the​ ​University.  \nThe University receives two primary sources of revenue to support its operating budget: the Campus Alberta                \ngrant and tuition & fees. It is from these sources that the remaining funding is allocated for the student                   \nservices​ ​not​ ​fully​ ​funded​ ​by​ ​other​ ​revenues​ ​and​ ​MNIFs. \nATHLETICS AND RECREATION\nTotal Expenditures Other Revenues MNIF Revenue Net Difference \nFiscal 2016-17\nA.

In \nMarch of 2016 the Board of Governors approved the restructuring of the \nMNIFs.  \nAs part of the MNIFs restructuring, the three parties agreed to the use of \nan Academic Price Index (API) in the calculation of annual increases to \nthe MNIFs.  The API was designed to reflect inflation drivers within the \nuniversity versus the Alberta Consumer Price Index (CPI) that was used \nin the past.   \nUsing the agreed to formula, the 2018-19 API for Mandatory Non-\nInstructional Fees has been calculated at 3.14 per cent (see attached). \nPursuant to the agreement with the student associations, this information \nis being provided to the Board Finance and Property Committee for \ninformation.   \nAlthough the agreed to process allows MNIFs to increase subject to the \nAPI, under current government policy, all tuition and fee increases have \nbeen held at 0 per cent for the past three years.  Although, the Alberta \ngovernment committed to releasing the revised tuition fee regulation for \n2018-19 fees this fall, at the time of preparing this briefing, the updated \nregulation was still not available.   \nFor 2018-19 MNIFs will increase by the API of 3.14 or be adjusted \npursuant to the new tuition fee regulation.      \nTimeline/Implementation Date For 2018-19 Tuition and Fees \nSupplementary Notes and \ncontext \nThis item is being provided to the GFC Academic Planning Committee \n(APC) as an Information Item. \nItem No. 9 \nGFC ACADEMIC PLANNING COMMITTEE \nFor the Meeting of November 8, 2017 \n  Engagement and Routing (Include meeting dates) \nParticipation: \n(parties who have seen the \nproposal and in what capacity) \n<For further information see \nthe link posted on \nthe Governance Toolkit section \nStudent Participation Protocol> \nThose who have been informed: \n• Joint Student/University Oversight Committee on Mandatory Non-\nInstructional Fees – for information \n• GFC Academic Planning Committee (November 8, 2017) – \nInformation Item \nThose who have been consulted: \n•  \nThose who are actively participating: \n• Joint Student/University Oversight Committee on Mandatory Non-\nInstructional Fees – for information \n  Alignment/Compliance \nAlignment with Guiding \nDocuments \nFor the Public Good, Comprehensive Institutional Plan and Budget, Joint \nStudent/University Oversight Committee on Mandatory Non-Instructional \nFees – terms of reference \nCompliance with Legislation, \nPolicy and/or Procedure \nRelevant to the Proposal \n(please quote legislation and \ninclude identifying section \nnumbers) \n1.

Background information/briefing note (page(s) 1 - 2)  \n      2018 - 19 Mandatory Non-Instructional Fee Academic Price Index Calculation \nPrepared by: Philip Stack, philip.stack@ualberta.ca \nmailto:philip.stack@ualberta.ca\n2018-19 MNIF ACADEMIC PRICE INDEX CALCULATION 1 \n2018 - 19 Mandatory Non-Instructional Fee \nAcademic Price Index Calculation \nBackground \nThe Academic Price Index (API) was developed in cooperation between the university, Students’ \nUnion and Graduate Students’ Association, to determine the annual increase to be applied to \nMandatory Non-Instructional Fees (MNIFs).  The formula is a three-year weighted calculation \nbased on the university’s primary operating budget expenditures of salary, benefits, materials \nand supplies, utilities and maintenance.   \nAs a human resource driven organization, many of the expenditures associated with providing \nservices supported by MNIFs, are impacted by salary and benefit costs (total compensation). \nThe weighting of the formula was designed to reflect this distribution of expenditures.   \nBoth the academic staff (including administrative professional officers), represented by the \nAssociation of Academic staff: University of Alberta (AASUA) and support staff, represented by \nthe Non-Academic Staff Association (NASA), negotiate total compensation with the university \nthrough a collective bargaining process. As the MNIF supported services are provided by staff \nwho fall under one of the staff associations, the negotiated changes to total compensation are \nreflected in the Academic Price Index calculation.   \nIn the absence of a negotiated agreement between the associations and the university, it was \nagreed with the student associations that an external source would be used to estimate wage \nincreases for the coming year.  As the university and associations have not yet negotiated a \ncompensation agreement for 2018-19, the university used the Government of Alberta’s First \nQuarter Fiscal Update and Economic Statement from August 2017, to calculate the estimated \nsalary increases for 2018-19.   \nIncreases, in all other non-salary expenditures, are calculated using a forecast of the Alberta \nConsumer Price Index (CPI). \nThe following is the API calculation for 2018-19. \n2018-19 MNIF ACADEMIC PRICE INDEX CALCULATION 2 \n\tItem-1-Agenda-\n\tItem-2-Minutes\n\tItem-4-Course-Based-MA-HADVC\n\tatt 1 Template A REVISED 10 23 2017\n\tatt 2 Template B1 REVISED 10 20 2017\n\tatt 3 HADVC MA course-based APPENDICES \n\tItem-5-MScPT-PhD-combined-program\n\tatt 1 MScPT PhD\n\tItem-7-2016-17-MNIF-Report\n\t2016-17 MNIF Report\n\tItem-9-API-calculation-for-MNIF\n\t2018-19 MNIF API Calculation\n",
