The \nstudents’ academic experience is enriched by linking learning with other aspects of their lives, and \nmany institutional goals are met as they relate to student recruitment, retention and achievement. \nIn a time of competing needs and economic uncertainty, it is critical that our limited post-secondary \nresources be dedicated to those areas directly relating to student recruitment and achievement. That \nis why the provision of sufficient on-campus housing for learners is so important – because it \nsignificantly impacts and supports their academic success, directs limited resources to where they \nare needed most and assists institutions in meeting overall goals and objectives. \nIn order to improve access to the University of Alberta for rural Albertans, students from across \nCanada and abroad, and to further enhance its leadership development capacity, additional \naccessible and supportive purpose-built student housing is required.  \nIt is the goal of the University of Alberta to house up to 25 per cent of its full-time enrolment in \npurpose-built student housing on its various campuses. Furthermore, it is the goal of the University of \nAlberta to guarantee housing for all first-year students accepted by the university. \nThe 2016 Institutional Strategic Plan identifies the expansion of the student housing portfolio as a \nstrategic priority for the University of Alberta; reaffirming Ancillary Services’ long-term strategy for \nstudent housing (2015 – 2040 Strategy for Residences, May 2015). \nIssues \nDespite currently having capacity to accommodate 4,854 students on its Edmonton campuses \n(additional 143 beds in Peter Lougheed Hall due to open in 2017), at no time over the last decade has \nthe university been able to address demand.  \nGuaranteed housing for new students is an important tool for the university to use as it continues to \nrecruit. However, downstream benefits (student engagement and satisfaction) are diminished if the \nhousing is not supportive and attractive to students when they arrive. \nAncillary Services recently developed a long-term strategy for student housing (2015 – 2040 Strategy \nfor Student Residences, May 2015) that was presented to the Board Finance and Property Committee \non June 2, 2015. In that document two successive five-year plans were recommended. The first plan \n(2015-2020) included development of a new tower on the Lister Centre site to accommodate up to \n520 first-year students and the development of an additional 300 bed spaces in East Campus Village \n(ECV) in apartment-style accommodation.  \nKelly Hopkin, Manager Campus Architecture                   Page 2 of 2                                                May 26, 2016 \nAs part of the community consultation process, the University has taken design options to the \ncommunity and students for input; Open House #1 - February 25, 2016, Open House #2 - May 17, \n2016 and the Focus Group Consultation for students at Lister Centre on April 14, 2016. Student \nRepresentatives participated in the Schematic Design Phase of the modified design build process \nalong with university staff and the design build team. \nThe current Lister Centre site includes four towers:  Henday Hall, Mackenzie Hall, Kelsey Hall and \nMary Schaeffer Hall. Between 1,700 and 1,800 students live in these towers (depending upon double \noccupancy). Of the total population, Mary Schaeffer Hall accommodates 420 second-year students. In \norder to facilitate early implementation of a first-year housing guarantee, Ancillary Services will convert \nMary Schaeffer Hall to a first-year residence in 2016.  \nIn order to optimize the residence experience for all students (including those displaced by the \nSchaeffer conversion) Ancillary Services proposes to open a new 5 story 460 bed (200 double \noccupancy rooms) first-year residence (Lister 5) in 2018 and also 300 new spaces in four and six \nbedroom apartments in East Campus Village 9 (ECV 9) for upper-year undergraduate students. \nThe residence will be linked by an on-grade connector to Mackenzie Hall and through there to the \nentire Lister Complex. In order to foster a sense of community, students will take meals together in \nthe Lister Centre dining hall. The Lister 5 residence will feature primarily double bedroom \nconfigurations organized around large common/social areas and washroom cores on each floor. \nThe building will feature the appropriate amount of amenities or programmable space required to \ndeliver support services for first-year students including:  \n• Study Rooms of varying size \n• Lobby/Living Room \n• Lounges \n• Main Floor Community Kitchen \n• Main Floor Laundry \n• Fitness Centre \n• Multi-purpose Room \n• Media Games Room \n• Office space for RA and Association use \nA (17) stall portion of the existing parking lot north of the university access road (84A Avenue NW) \noff of 117 Street has been retained in the design. As well, a car lay-by lane has been proposed for \nthe north side of the university access road to facilitate seasonal move-in activities. The lay-by lane \nis adjacent to a new tree lined sidewalk along the university access road to allow for community and \nresident access to the LRT station to the east. \nConstruction Schedule \n• Site Mobilization - summer 2016  \n• Project Occupancy - fall 2018 \nSustainable Design \n• Green Globes (target of 3 globes) \nLISTER 5\nSCHEMATIC DESIGN REPORT - ISSUED MAY 10, 2016\nLister 5\nSchematic Design Report\n2\nLister 5\nSchematic Design Report\n3\nExecutive Summary\n1.0 Introduction\n Project Background\n Desired Outcome\n Methodology\n2.0 Architectural Design\n Program Overview and Reconciliation\n Design Evolution\n Existing Conditions & Site\n Design Concept \n Sustainable Design\n Life Safety\n Building Code Report\n3.0 Structural Design\n General\n Design Criteria\n Building Structure\n Delegated Structural Design\n Green Globes/Sustainable Design\n4.0 Mechanical Design\n Design Criteria\n Ventilation\n Insulation\n Plumbing\n Fire Protection\n Heating \n Air Distribution\n Sustainable Design Strategies\n5.0 Electrical Design\n Introduction\n Sustainable Design Considerations\n Electrical Systems\n Low Tension Systems\n Mechanical Systems\n Commissioning and Testing\n6.0 Site Development\n Existing Development Area\n Landscape, Grading & Civil Servicing\n Landscape Design\n Site Grading\n Storm Servicing\n Sanitary Servicing\n7.0 Next Steps\nTA\nB\nLE\n O\nF \nCO\nN\nTE\nN\nTS\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nLister 5\nSchematic Design Report\n4\nP\nR\nO\nJE\nC\nT \nST\nA\nR\nT \n- \nU\nP\n O\nP\nEN\n H\nO\nU\nSE\nLister 5\nSchematic Design Report\n5\nP\nR\nO\nJE\nC\nT \nST\nA\nR\nT \n- \nU\nP\n O\nP\nEN\n H\nO\nU\nSE\nLister 5\nSchematic Design Report\n6\nP\nR\nO\nJE\nC\nT \nST\nA\nR\nT \n- \nU\nP\n O\nP\nEN\n H\nO\nU\nSE\nLister 5\nSchematic Design Report\n7\nP\nR\nO\nJE\nC\nT \nST\nA\nR\nT \n- \nU\nP\n O\nP\nEN\n H\nO\nU\nSE\nLister 5\nSchematic Design Report\n8\nP\nR\nO\nJE\nC\nT \nST\nA\nR\nT \n- \nU\nP\n O\nP\nEN\n H\nO\nU\nSE\nLister 5\nSchematic Design Report\n9\nP\nR\nO\nJE\nC\nT \nST\nA\nR\nT \n- \nU\nP\n O\nP\nEN\n H\nO\nU\nSE\nLister 5\nSchematic Design Report\n10\nP\nR\nO\nJE\nC\nT \nST\nA\nR\nT \n- \nU\nP\n O\nP\nEN\n H\nO\nU\nSE\n -\n F\nEE\nD\nB\nA\nC\nK\nLister 5 and East Campus Village 9  \nStudent Housing Projects \nThursday, February 25, 2016 \n5 – 8 p.m. \nPrairie Room, Lister Centre \n87 Avenue and 116 Street \nEVALUATION SUMMARY \n25 evaluations were received \n1.

Please comment on your impressions regarding Board #5:\nSite Option #1:\n• Interesting location if loss of parking can be overcome.\n• Too crowded around existing buildings.\n• I think that this is the best location! It allows for sunlight into  \n most of the rooms and will not cause as much noise distur \n bance for resident during construction.\n• Keep towers all together! Easier for planning and integrating  \n students.\n• Any decrease in parking availability is bound to be contentious.  \n Distance to campus seems a little inconvenient to me.\n• Not overly fond that the Lister Centre parking lot would lose  \n space, having to designate a different and/or larger area for  \n parking. Like the idea that it’s closer to main campus though!\n• Tower would receive excessive noise from gym, road and would  \n obstruct university view for other towers.\n• This seems to be a messy option, hiding the entrance to the  \n Lister Center and squashed onto a small site.\n• It would be too congested and spoil public access to the Lister  \n Centre.\n• High levels of street noise.\n• Least favored option - too close to 87 Avenue and 116/117  \n Street; increased pedestrian traffic at an intersection that is  \n already an issue during class times and particularly during the  \n many events held at U of A.\n• Option #1 is the least disruptive to the surrounding community.  \n It helps connect the existing Lister complex with the rest of the  \n campus. It maintains parking and recreational space.\n• Scale down the size of the building for this proposed site.\n• Would be helpful to have compass direction on site map.\n• Option 1 makes least impact to Windsor Park neighbourhood.\nSite Option #2:\n• Close to 117 Street would maximize impact on neighbours.\n• Too close to residential buildings.\n• Do not like!\n• Is the rink a university facility? Does this proximity maybe hin \n der existing use of rink?\n• The best option in my opinion as it causes the least amount  \n of impact for the pre-existing buildings already there. Don’t  \n mind the longer tunnel walk as each of the towers (other than  \n Schaffer) already have a tunnel walk.\n• Decrease of student parking would be a large adverse effect.\n• This will make the new tower too dominant from the street and  \n casting too much shade as noted on the board.\n• Far too close to 117 Street and shadowing of residential build \n ings.\n• Decreases student parking is undesirable. Parking space is lim \n ited currently.\n• Better than option #2 - would need to improve traffic manage \n ment at the U of  parking lots nearby; often the lines for park \n ing are held up along 87 Avenue and 116 Street because of  \n the slow payment process (one stall) at these locations and  \n no parking staff on duty to manage traffic flow. This option  \n would only intensify the illegal parking (by students) and stu \n dents (who live in the area, community to U of A). Where  \n would the students/visitors park if a residence goes up on this  \n lot?\n• This option will provide the greatest neighbourhood disruption  \n (traffic, noise, garbage) depending on the final placement and  \n building height. It also provides for the least privacy for \n neighbor residents. It takes away parking and recreational  \n space.\n• Proposed building absolutely too close to 117 Street.\n• Option 2 poorest, extreme close proximity to the South \n Windsor Park neighbourhood!\nSite Option #3:\n• Probably most logical choice: back from 117 street and retains  \n parking.\n• Best option.\n• Do not like!\n• I liked option three. It appears to be more balanced and would  \n easily connect to the current Lister Towers.\n• I like this option the best seems like a better location - although  \n it destroys the rink, seems as though there are a lot of recre \n ation facilities provided in the building.\n• Not ideal as it would affect the ice rink and parking lot but  \n probably the last place to put it for spacing.\n• Likely best option; keeps maximum green space while using  \n location from a rink that is relatively unused.\n• This appears to be the best option. It ? The rink (which is how \n ever little used).\n• The best location. When constructing please retain the trees  \n and shrubs along 117 Street; please keep the walkway that is  \n south of the present Lister Hall buildings and extend the walk \n way to link with the path along the north side of the Materials  \n Bldg. to enable easy access to LRT.\n• Best option. Rink is underused and the underground walk dis \n tance is very insubstantial. Student parking would need to be  \n replaced.\n• Preferred option - best to locate student housing behind Lister  \n Centre away from 117 St/116 St and 87 Avenue and insulated  \n from residents in the area.\n• Similar problems to option #2. \n• Option 3 is the best fit within the existing community. It allows  \n for the preservation of Lister’s ice rink.\n• Set back from 117 Street and as far north as room permits.\n• Please set back proposed building further east and north away  \n from private homes on the west side of 117 Street.\n• Appears reasonable.\n• Option 3 is an okay site. Ice rink is not being used frequently  \n during the winter months.\n8. Please provide comments on the conceptual design \\\n criteria(Board #6) that would help to build a healthy stu \n dent community:\n• Spacing the buildings will enhance the feeling of living in a sep \n arate residence but still being connected to the community via  \n a tunnel walkway.\n• Safe, secure open spaces.\n• They all seem like good gridlines and however they way all the  \n information is provided on the board are somewhat difficult to  \n engage with.\n• It’s good that the community is being considered when design \n ing and building the new places, minimize the impact to the  \n communities! How are they going to expand the cafeteria to  \n accommodate for all these new residents though?\n• Design should take into account the load seen by 520 extra  \n students on an already very busy food services system within  \n Lister (i.e. addition or expansion of food services).\nLister 5\nSchematic Design Report\n13\nP\nR\nO\nJE\nC\nT \nST\nA\nR\nT \n- \nU\nP\n O\nP\nEN\n H\nO\nU\nSE\n -\n F\nEE\nD\nB\nA\nC\nK\n• There are worthy generalities but nothing is promised. The  \n quality of the building is critical, but not mentioned.\n• The building should be at least LEED Silver and preferably high  \n standard. Generation for solar energy or use of passive solar  \n (having ? over south facing windows so cool in summer and sun  \n into rooms in winter).\n• An influx of 500 students will put dramatic strain on parking,  \n food services and athletic facilities.\n• While there may be less students buying parking passes on  \n campus, many students, their friends and family members \n are parking in the surrounding residential areas, illegally and  \n using parking passes to commute and parking in the surround \n ing residential areas at all hours of the day and night. Adequate  \n parking for students living in residence, their friends and family  \n should be located on campus. There is a definite trend of stu \n dents parking on a casual basis, wherever they can find a “free  \n space”. This trend continues in areas outside the residential  \n areas (e.g. Emily Murphy Park).\n• Student community is a good plan. Needs more commercial  \n space to provide services. Presenter mentioned HUB commer \n cial space. This would be desirable considering all the plans add  \n over 1000 people.\n• Implementation of more study areas. Dedicated social spaces.\n• We need more quiet study space. Programming space that is  \n flexible and well-furnished.\n9. Please provide any further comments about the Lister 5  \n student housing project:\n• As members of the community (who look out directly \n on Lister) our primary interest/concerns are: \n 1) having a lower rise building that doesn`t significantly block  \n sun; \n 2) having an appealing architectural design; \n 3) continuing to have Lister as a `good neighbour` in the \n community (which we currently feel is the case)\n• Not at this time.\n• The project seems to be based on good principles for design  \n in the community as well as the building itself - however the  \n way it is presented is a little alienating and somewhat difficult  \n to understand, doesn`t really seem to consider design as much  \n as other project - towers are alienating as it stands, maybe  \n should consider ground floor connection more\n• I am a first year student in Lister right now (Kelsey) and option/  \n time depending, won’t be ready for me in time? Would be in  \n the start of 4th year when completed.\n• Existing ‘green’ landscape should be preserved.\n• If using site #3 please ensure continued access to the LRT for  \n those who walk from S. Windsor Park through the current park \n ing lot between the ice rink and the sports field.\n• I have been told by three people here that students have been  \n consulted. Who? This is the first opportunity I have had to ex \n press any opinion. Five students is not a sufficient sample size.\n• Many unanswered questions, for example, how large will  \n this tower be? Is the U of A planning to demolish any of the  \n older towers? How will increased noise and density issues be  \n addressed? What plans are in place to keep students out of  \n residential areas (especially at night)?\n• Concern that Lister is geared to 1st year students. Problems in  \n neighbourhood with drinking and noise, especially in the  \n fall. Adding 500 more people in this space will increase the  \n intrusion hence design decisions are important to peaceful  \n neighbour relations.\n• Shorter height than MacKenzie, Henday and Schafer. Noise  \n factor, Additional traffic.\n• Decrease height with fewer floors/story. Noise factor from  \n building equipment etc. as well as residents/occupants in the  \n building. 10 story’s too high.\n• Will it be more expensive to live here as opposed to the older  \n Lister Towers? How will you make the older Lister Towers more  \n appealing to first year students?\n• Need to see what the rooms and floors would look like.\n• Of the 3 options for the location of Lister 5, I prefer \n option 3 even though it means sacrificing the rink, for the rea \n sons given on the posters. Lister Centre is massive along 87th  \n Avenue as it is.  We don’t need another big building on the  \n corner, and we do need the landscaping and set back both  \n at the southeast corner of 87th and 117th and along 117th \n between Lister 5 and the community. Speaking of landscaping,  \n I’m hoping that the existing landscaped buffer along 117th  \n Street will remain during and after construction. To keep  \n the  landscaping intact, I’m also hoping that access to the  \n construction site can use the 117 St. parking lot entrance or  \n possibly an entrance from the interior road that runs west  \n of the Jub and the Materials Bldg. south of 87th (and east of  \n the Lister complex). Here’s an enhancement in the Lister com \n plex area that would benefit the community, both the \n university community and residents of the Windsor Park neigh \n bourhood. The walkway that runs east into campus from 117th  \n Street, between the rink on one side and Mackenzie and Hen \n day halls on the other, is used by community members (both  \n university community and Windsor Park residents) to get to  \n the Health Sciences LRT Station. The walkway, built years  \n before the LRT station, turns left east of the rink toward Lister  \n Centre on one side and right toward the parking lot on the  \n other, and does not extend to the crosswalk across the \n internal road. To get to the LRT station, pedestrians have to  \n walk on grass (sometimes soggy wet) or snow pack or slush  \n to get to the crosswalk, and it’s very icy to navigate in winter  \n because of our freeze thaw cycles. It would be great if the  \n walkway could be extended through that grassy area to the  \n crosswalk as part of Lister 5 construction. Thanks for consid \n ering my suggestions and sharing them with others involved in  \n the project.”\n• I’m emailing with a proposal for the new Lister tower that is \n beng planned.  As I’m sure you already know, the Lister Dodge \n ball League currently uses the David Tuckey gymnasium for \n all of its programming. However, as of recently, more and  \n more student groups have been booking time in the Tuckey  \n for their own events making it difficult to keep up with the de \n mand of student programming. I’m writing to ask if it could be  \n possible to consider building another gym space with the new  \n tower. This new gym space would not only benefit the students  \n of Lister, but the whole university. While Lister residents would  \n benefit from the new gym space immensely because there  \n would be time and a space to provide residents with more  \n dodgeball programming as well as programming for residents  \n who don’t play dodgeball. The entire university would benefit  \n because there will be more space for student groups as well as  \n recreation services to book gym space for their programming.   \n Since the Tuckey is a free space for student groups to book, it is  \n used by many groups and if there was more space for those  \n activities, other groups such as the Egyptian Soccer student  \n group, recreational ball hockey, East Campus Dodgeball League  \n and many other groups would be able to run more successful  \n programs. “\nLister 5\nSchematic Design Report\n14\nLister 5\nSchematic Design Report\n15\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY\nLister 5\nSchematic Design Report\n16\nE\nX\nE\nC\nU\nTI\nV\nE\n S\nU\nM\nM\nA\nR\nY\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY \nThe proposed project consists of the Design Development, Construction \nDocumentation completion and Construction of a new student residence \nat the University of Alberta in the Lister Centre site located south of the \nexisting towers on 117th Street. \nThe project will be developed in two Phases, Phase 1 – Design Phase \n(Schematic Design and Design Development) and Phase 2 – Final Design \n(Construction Documentation) and Construction. \nIn February 2016, the Design Build (DB) Team, led by Graham Construction \nwas retained to develop Phase 1 – Design Phase of the Lister Tower # 5 \nproject. The contractual agreement is based on a Modified Design Build \nagreement that establishes the collaborative framework for the Design \nBuild process. This framework requires that the University of Alberta, \nGraham Construction, the Mechanical and Electrical Contractors, the \nArchitectural, Landscape, Mechanical, Electrical, Structural and Civil \nConsultants participate in the design process in a highly collaborative, \nfully integrated environment.\nThis report summarizes the Schematic Design Phase of the project and it \nincludes the Architectural, Structural, Mechanical, Electrical, Landscape \nand Civil schematic design parameters as well as an outline of the \nsustainable design principles and Building Code summary. \nProject Goals\nThe project goals as stated by the University of Alberta for this project \nare as follows:\n• Increase purpose built student residences to accommodate up  \n to 25% of full-time students at the University of Alberta\n• Support student recruitment, retention and achievement\n• Enhance community building, student life and campus   \n experience\n• Smart growth campus development that supports a safe,  \n sustainable and healthy community\n• Integrate planned neighbourhood with amenities\nBest Practices\nThe University of Alberta referenced the “Best Practices” identified in \nthe Tall Building Guidelines (City of Toronto). These guidelines were \ncarefully reviewed and addressed during the schematic design phase of \nthis project and are documented in the Design Process section of this \nreport.\nProject Background\nThe Lister Complex is comprised of four individual residential \ncommunities arranged around a central service core, is one of the \nUniversity of Alberta’s primary on-campus residence providers. The \nLister Complex provides accommodations for students attending the \nUniversity, as well as amenities such as food services, recreation and \nsocial opportunities, study spaces, teaching spaces, resident community \nareas and University staff service offices. \nThe atmosphere, amenities and opportunities that the Lister Complex \noffers to the students in their early years on campus, will set the stage \nfor their success in each student’s academic careers and well beyond \nthe University boundaries once they complete their education. \nIn response to these increasing demands for more and better \naccommodations on Campus, the University has identified the Lister \nComplex as a prime candidate for a new residential facility, building on \nthe strong foundation created by the existing Lister Community. \nMethodology\nThe University of Alberta and the Design Build team have met in the “Big \nRoom” or meeting/work space over the course of 10 consecutive weeks \nto review the design evolution and collaborated together to arrive to \nthe design proposal contained in this report. \nThe Big Room is a large space located at the University of Alberta that is \nspacious enough to accommodate the complete team for meetings and \non-going coordination work, including mock-up reviews. Scale mock-ups \nof the two typical rooms with furniture were set up and reviewed by the \nteam as part of the design process.\nEach Big Room session took place over the course of a day, divided \ninto a morning architectural design and program review session \nand an afternoon session to coordinate the engineering disciplines \nin consultation with the University of Alberta Project and Facilities \nManagement teams. These sessions included a facilitator that provided \nsupport to the team to meet the milestones and deliverables established \nat the outset of the project.\nLister 5 Student Residence Project Must Haves\nAt the first meeting, the University of Alberta presented a list of “must \nhaves” or non-negotiable requirements for the project which established \nthe priorities for the design process as follows:\n• Students Want to Stay in Residence (Gravity System) \n• Support Student Wellness \n• “Home Like” > Safe\n• Connectivity to Neighbourhood / Campus \n• Transform Lister Complex \n• Maximum Utilization Year Round (Not Just Beds, Conferences)\n• Knowable Community \n• Recruitment Tool \n• Support Community Development and Belonging (Roommate >  \n Hall > Building > Neighbourhood) \n• Optimizes Landscape Opportunities (Civic/Potential Future)\n• Facilitate Engagement and Academic Success \n• Reflect University Values / Academic Vision \n• Has to be Intentional (Function as Intended) \n• Building That Completes The Neighbourhood But Has Unique  \n Place In Our Inventory \n• Sense of Tradition (Cohort Persistence) \n• RA Ratio / Co RA (1:28 RA Single) \n• Sustainable (Energy) Tech Connectivity (Cable / Wireless)\n• “Huddle” Room \n• Creates a “Buzz” \nLister 5\nSchematic Design Report\n17\nProgram Overview\nThe Lister 5 Project RFP documents released in December of 2015, \nidentified the need for a residence tower to accommodate 520 student \nbeds. Based on the information presented in the RFP and the identified \nbudget, it was ascertained by the Design Build Team that construction of \na facility of approx. 9,031 m2 (97,200 sqft ) could be achievable. \nIn February 19, 2016, The University of Alberta provided a detailed \nprogram summary which formed the basis for the schematic design \nphase. The area allocation identified in this ehanced program varied \nfrom the assumptions made based on the RFP document. This program \nsummary identified a gross floor area of 12,296 m2 (132,358 sqft) and \na total bed count of 490 beds. The five areas identified in the February \n19, 2016 program document included Staff & Faculty living apartments, \nStudent living units, Floor community areas, Residence Hall Community \nand support spaces. \nThe program was reviewed, discussed and modified during the Big \nRoom sessions during the months of February and March and the first \ntwo weeks in April. Between the release of the program on February \n19th, 2016 and the first program reconciliation, numerous iterations, \narrangements and program configurations were presented for feedback \nand discussion. These interim steps and design concepts are captured in \nthe Design Concepts section in this report. \nIn March 2016, the Graham Design Build Team presented a program and \nbudget that was significantly larger than the initial RFP document and \nslightly above the February 19, 2016 Program statement. The Schematic \ndesign concept had grown to 12,528m2 (134,850 sqft). \nIn early April 2016, the project team met to identify potential cost savings \nand reduction strategies to align the current design with the initial \nprogram and the budget. A series of scope reviews were performed to \nassess potential area reductions, while still maintaining the vision and \nproject objectives. \nThe reduction in room size, combined with a revised student bed count \nof 460 beds, and a minor reduction in the amenity areas allowed the \nbuilding to shrink by 1,768m2 (17,680sqft), arriving to a total area \n10,200m2 (109,210sqft). A chart of reconciliation is included to record \nthe progression of the Program from the RFP Stage to the current \nconditions. The drawings included in this report represent the revised \nprogram and reconciled area approved by the University of Alberta.\nDesign Deliverables and Process\nThe Design Build team and the University of Alberta defined the \nfollowing objectives for the project after detailed discussions around \nproject vision, desired outcomes and a clear understanding of the “must \nhaves”:\n• Create a new home for a population of 460 students  \n• Create a safe, supportive community that is successfully   \n integrated to the existing Lister Complex  \n• Enhance the Lister Complex and be mindful of the \n neighbouring community \n• Reinforce engagement and create opportunities to promote  \n social interaction between faculty and students  \n• Create a living and learning center and create spaces that  \n support community\n• Design a building that is sustainable and supportive of social  \n sustainability to create an equitable, inclusive and resilient  \n community.  \n• Create horizontal as well as vertical integration.  \n• Provide infrastructure that can also support conferences  \nDuring the course of a 10-week process, the Design Team generated \nmultiple design options that were presented on a weekly basis to the \nUniversity of Alberta for discussion and validation. A detailed summary \nof all design iterations is included in this report as well as the final \nversion of the schematic design drawings and renderings. \nSite and context\nThe parcel of land allocated for the Lister 5 facility has been identified \nas the tract of land and parking area located south of the existing Lister \ncomplex, Henday and Mackenzie towers. This area currently supports \nstudent parking for the Lister Centre and has an outdoor hockey rink. \nThe remainder of the site is open park space with asphalt trails and \npathways linking the Henday and Mackenzie Halls to the rest of the \ncampus circulation routes. \nThe existing site has a grade difference from high to low of approximately \n2 m (6 – 7 ft). The design team has looked at this grade difference as an \nopportunity to use the grade difference and step the ground floor of \nthe building and provide areas that would benefit from increased ceiling \nheight in locations at the lowest grade elevation of the site. \nBuilding design\nThe design process started with an in-depth analysis of existing site \nservices and adjacencies to appropriately place the new building on \nthe site. Building placement was analyzed in conjunction with building \nmassing, height and exposure. The massing options generated for the \nFebruary and early March meetings generated a lot of discussion around \nthe appropriateness of a tall structure vs a reduced building height. It \nwas collectively agreed that a reduced building height offered better sun \nexposure and views as well as more privacy between buildings. However, \na lower building required a more extensive footprint and presented the \nopportunity to create new outdoor courtyards that became a natural \nextension of the already existing framework of open spaces. \nMassing and building planning were studied in parallel. Double loaded \nvs single loaded plans were developed and reviewed as well as the \npreferred placement of communal spaces in relationship to rooms and \nsupport spaces. A very detailed analysis of adjacencies, appropriate \nroom sizes as well as exposure took place over the course of several \nweeks leading to the current design.\nThe Design Team developed more detailed planning and elevations \nto generate a unique structure aiming at fulfilling the vision of \n“transformation” outlined by the University as critical for this project. \nThe triangulations in the floor plans were generated to arrive to area \nefficiencies and more importantly create unique spaces at intersections \nthat manifest themselves on the elevations through the use of extensive \nareas of glass that provide transparency and access to natural light.

This facility supplies residence accommodations \nfor students attending the University, as well as amenities such as food \nservices, recreation and social opportunities, study spaces, teaching \nspaces, resident community areas and University staff service offices.\nThe facility is comprised of four individual residential communities \narranged around a central service core, housing a total of approximately \n1,800 students.  The first components of the Lister Complex were \nconstructed in 1964 and are comprised of the Henday Tower, Mackenzie \nTower and Kelsey Hall, all serviced by the central Lister food service \ncomplex. In 2003, Schaffer Hall was constructed to expand the residence \ncomplex capacity to meet the growing need for student housing on \ncampus.  \nEach of the residence buildings is linked to the service core through \nabove grade exterior walkways and more importantly, an underground \npedestrian tunnel system. This tunnel system is the predominant path \nof travel for the typical student, as it affords shelter and protection to \nthe students as they travel from their residence to classes on Campus. \nThis tunnel system is a luxury that is well used allowing students to \ntransverse Lister Complex in the comfort of shorts and flip flops even on \nthe coldest of winter days. \nEach community has its own identity, even though three of the four \nresidences are similar in construction and appearance.  It is in this \nidentity that students will work together to create a new community \neach and every school year, welcoming new and returning students, and \nproviding the safety and security that students will miss when leaving \ntheir homes in other towns, cities, provinces and countries. The University \nunderstands that the atmosphere, amenities and opportunities that the \nLister Complex offers to the students in their early years on campus, \nwill set the stage for their success in each student’s academic careers \nand well beyond the University boundaries once they complete their \neducation. \nThe demand for on-campus accommodations is steadily increasing \nand is becoming an important variable for students when making their \ndecisions to select which University to attend.  In response to these \nincreasing demands for more and better accommodations on Campus, \nthe University has identified the Lister Complex as a prime candidate for \na new residential facility, building on the strong foundation created by \nthe existing Lister communities. In preparation for the issuance of the \nRFP for this project, the University team went abroad and visited other \nUniversity campus residence facilities to gather an understanding and \nview on current trends and best practices in some of the most current \nand/or successful residence models in operation today. \nLister 5 will add significant capacity to the complex, allowing the \nUniversity to support it’s mandate of guaranteeing housing for any first \nyear student accepted by the University.  The social and amenity spaces \nhave been designed to enhance the first year experience program which \nis based upon intentional learning outcomes for the first year student \ndemographic. \nIn late 2015, the University issued an RFP for Design-Build Services to \nwork with the University and develop the next residence on the Lister \nComplex site. In February of 2016, the Graham Design-Build team \nwas awarded the opportunity to join the University in expanding the \nresidential offerings on Campus with the Lister 5 Project.  In conjunction \nwith the start of the design process on the Lister 5 Project, the U of A \nteam engaged the community in a Public open house forum to gather \nvaluable feedback from the community at large. The Open House was \nconducted on February 25, 2016 and was open to the public for comment.  \nThe Open House identified the Lister 5 project as a component in the \nNorth Campus Long Range Plan, presenting the site selection process \nand listing the Best Practices for Concept Design.  The comments and \nfeedback received from this event, was tabulated, documented and \npassed on to the design team as a reference to inform decisions that \nwill shape the schematic design.\nThe information herein provides the rationale and development of \nthe schematic design process leading up to the date of issue of this \nreport, and gives valuable insight into the countless hours of discussion, \ncollaboration, consultation and documentation of the Schematic Design \nprocess.\n1.\n0 \nIN\nTR\nO\nD\nU\nC\nTI\nO\nN\nLister 5\nSchematic Design Report\n21\nDesired Outcomes\nThe purpose of the Schematic Design process and report is to provide \nthe following:\n• Affirm and document the agreed scope of work.\n• Validate and expand upon the functional program as presented by \nthe U of A.\n• A framework for a realistic and founded Schematic Design cost \nopinion.\n• A foundation for decisions to move forward in a direction that is \nclear and educated into the next phases of the project. \n• Document decisions made during the Schematic Design process and \nillustrate the rationale behind these decisions.\nMethodology\nIn order to engage all parties from the user, owner, contractor and \ndesign teams, meetings were held on a weekly basis. These “Big Room” \nmeetings were held with the purpose of allowing a wide cross section \nof input from all interested parties, simultaneously vetting concepts, \nideas and visions amongst all team members and seeking discussion and \nvalidation at the same time.  This process allowed the team to move \nquickly through concepts and schematic design ideas, while at the same \ntime analyzing cost, function, form and operations. These debates, \nconversations and sharing of ideas, strengthened each stakeholder’s \n“vision” for the project and provided the team with a unified direction \nto proceed forward in the design process.  Through this process, the \nproject team identified the following list of “non-negotiable” items.  This \nlist is the basis to test the design decisions against and validate whether \nor not we are meeting the project team goals:\nU of A LISTER 5 RESIDENCE “MUST HAVES”\n1.

Based on that information the Graham Design Build team \nperformed a preliminary program test to see how this program might \nalign with the budget presented.  Based on  information presented \nin the RFP, the desired bed count and the budget, it was ascertained \nthat construction of a facility of approximately 9,031 m2  (97,200 sq. \nft.) could be achievable.  With the award of the project to the Graham \nDesign Build team, the University of Alberta provided a more detailed \nand comprehensive program document Identifying five major program \nareas.  \nThe five areas identified in the February 19, 2016 program document \nincluded Staff & Faculty Living Apartments, Student Living Units, Floor \nCommunity Areas, Residence Hall Community and Support spaces. The \narea allocation identified in this program was significantly different from \nthe assumptions made based on the RFP document by the Design Build \nteam and had identified a gross floor area for the facility of 12, 296 m2 \n(132,358 sq. ft.) and the identified student capacity reduced to 490 \nstudents. The detailed program document allowed the design team to \nbegin the process of putting the program on paper and coming up with \nplans that tested the program and its relationships to all the elements. \nThe program areas were divided up with the following requirements.\nStaff & Faculty Living Units\nIncluded in this program area are the live in residential units that will \nhouse the Residence Coordinator and one faculty apartment.  These \nunits will provide the accommodations for those professionals that \nwill be required to provide student services while living on campus in \nthe residence community. These units are akin to a 90 m2 (990 sq. ft.) \nbedroom apartment/condo environment.\nStudent Living Units\nThe student living area component of the program provides the student \naccommodation spaces. In this program area the February program \nidentified 230 double room beds, 20 single room RA beds and 10 \naccessible room units, for a total of 490 students.\nFloor Community\nThe Floor Community program provides the amenity and student \nservice spaces to support the Student living units.  In this program \narea, amenities such as study rooms, lounges/kitchenettes, common \nlounges and washroom facilities are provided. The residence building \nwas divided into 14 smaller communities, each of these communities \nwas programmed and intended to provide an environment that is more \npersonal and allows the student to engage with the other residents \nof their community on a more personal level, giving the student the \nopportunity to gain that sense of belonging to a more intimate personal \ntype setting. Each of these communities is to be served by its own study \nspace, lounge / kitchenette and washroom facilities.\nResidence Hall Community\nThis program area responds directly to the overall Lister 5 residence \ncommunity.  The program functions listed under this heading are \nprovided to serve the students living in Lister 5 and potentially other \nstudents in the Lister Hall complex depending on the function and \nlocation. The services that would support the Lister 5 facility include; \nstudy rooms, lobby / living room, lounge, kitchen, laundry, fitness centre, \nmulti-purpose room, classrooms, media / games room and office spaces \nfor the RA and Association use.  The classroom, fitness, games room and \nmulti-purpose room are program spaces that are envisioned to be used \nby more than just the Lister 5 residents and could provide additional \namenity opportunities for all the students in the Lister Complex.\nSupport Spaces\nThe final program area listed in the February program, deals with the \nprogram spaces that are required to provide a supporting role to all of the \nother functions listed in the program document. These spaces include \nthe mechanical and electrical rooms, bike storage, building storage, \ntrash and recycle, custodial services and circulation and connection to \nthe existing Lister complex. All of these spaces are essential to providing \na high quality residential experience for the student living in the Lister \n5 facility.\nThroughout the design process the program areas were consulted and \ntested to make sure that all the University needs and requirements \nwere being captured and maintained.  However the as the design \nprocess matured the program areas slowly increased or were added \nto.  Between the release of the initial program on February 19th and \nthe first program reconciliation, numerous iterations, arrangements and \nprogram configurations were presented to the Big Room for feedback \nand discussion.  These interim steps and design concepts are captured \nin the Design Concepts section in this report. In March 2016, the \nGraham Design Build Team presented a program and budget that was \nsignificantly larger than the initial RFP document and slightly above the \nFebruary program statement. The schematic design concept had grown \nto 12,528 m2 (134,850 sq. ft.). While all of the program functions and \nareas were accounted for in this design solution, it was found that there \nwas a need to drive the project back towards the original program areas \nwhile maintaining as much of the valuable discussions and feedback \nreceived from the Client during the schematic design process.  \nIn early April, the project team met to identify potential cost savings \nand reduction strategies to align the current design with the initial \nprogram. From this meeting a series of scope reviews were performed \nto determine where area could be saved on the project, while \nstill maintaining the vision and dedication to providing a quality \nenvironment and experience for the student residents.  The biggest and \nmost exhaustive review completed in this phase was the review of the \nindividual room unit size.  The project team laid out the student living \nunit in full scale with furniture place holders to physically determine the \nbest and most efficient size and arrangement for the dorm room. The \nagreements and decisions made to reduce the room size manifested \nitself in the reduction of area from the initial program area of 21.3 m2 \n(230 sq. ft.) to 14 m2 (182 sq. ft.) per room.  This reduction in room size, \ncombined with a revisited room / student bed count of 460 students, \nas well as slightly reduce amenity areas allowed the building to shrink \nby 1,768 m2 (17,680 sq. ft.), for a total of 10,200 m2 (109,210 sq.ft.). As \nof this report, the current design and program is under the February \nprogram area but still above the area originally estimated from the RFP \nproject issued by the U of A and therefore the exploration of further \narea reduction and cost savings is not complete.\nA chart of reconciliation is included to record the progression of the \nprogram from the RFP Stage to the current conditions as reflected in \nthis Schematic Design Report.\nLister 5\nSchematic Design Report\n27\n2.\n0 \nA\nR\nC\nH\nIT\nEC\nTU\nR\nA\nL\nPROGRAM ANALYSIS CHART\nLister 5\nSchematic Design Report\n28\nDESIGN EVOLUTION\nThe schematic design floor plans and images that are represented in \nthis report are the culmination of multiple and unique iterations of \nplans and visual representations of the program. The design process has \ntraveled through the original inception of three distinct floor plans and \nmassing forms presented at the “Big Room” meeting on February 25, \n2016 to what is being presented here in the proposed schematic design \nconcept. \nFebruary 25, 2016 Meeting\nThe first design concept unveiled at the February 25th meeting explored \nthe implications and fit of the building on the site if the new facility was \na comprised of a regular, rectangular floor plan, 10 stories in height and \nsituated in the southwest corner of the site. \nThe second design concept explored the idea of stretching the building \nto make it more linear and efficient using the corridor in a double loaded \nconfiguration.  This concept created a mass that contained the program \nin an overall height of 10 storeys as well. \nThe third concept presented at the meeting pushed the linear theme \nfurther in order to try to reduce the overall height of the building by \nadding more rooms per floor and making the building larger in overall \nfootprint. This concept created a ‘W” shaped building and reduced the \noverall height to 5 storeys. \nThe most prominent comments and discussion at the February 25th \nmeeting centered around the height of the building and its placement \non the site. With these comments and discussion points in hand the \ndesign team went away from the meeting to refine the design concept. \n2.\n0 \nA\nR\nC\nH\nIT\nEC\nTU\nR\nA\nL\nLister 5\nSchematic Design Report\n29\nMarch 4, 2016 Meeting \nOn March 4, 2016 the Design team came back to the Project team \nwith three new designs that explored the options available with site \nplacement and shape versus building height. Concept 1 as presented, \nexplored a traditional “L” shaped building with all of the program space \ncontained in a 6 storey envelope. This mass was placed to the southeast \ncorner of the site. \nThe second building concept modified the Concept 1 plan by creating \ntwo smaller “L” shaped masses joined to create a single floor plan. This \nconcept used a combination of 5 and 6 storeys, however this design \nused more of the site due to its longer footprint.  \nConcept 3 was a variation to concept one in the manner that it explored \nthe “L” shaped mass, however this concept articulated the exterior wall \nplanes to create a more irregular shape and manifested the program in \na 6 storey mass. Of these three options the Project team agreed that \nthe development and refinement of Concept 3 was preferred and that \nthe design team should proceed based on this concept as the desired \nmassing and building form.\n2.\n0 \nA\nR\nC\nH\nIT\nEC\nTU\nR\nA\nL\nLister 5\nSchematic Design Report\n30\nMarch 16, 2016 Meeting\nThe next meeting to review the design refinement occurred on March \n16, 2016. At this meeting the design team presented the refined \nConcept 3 plans and massing imagery and presented in more detail \nhow the footprint would contain the program spaces and where it \nwould nest into the site. The design concept also started to address the \nconnectivity to the rest of the campus with pedestrian circulation to the \nMackenzie Hall tower and the network of pathways found on site.  This \ndesign also introduced the idea of eliminating all main floor resident \nrooms by elevating the east leg of the building, one storey above grade. \nThis decision to move the entire east wing up one level created the \nopportunity of exploring the transparency of the building at grade level \nwith the introduction of a landscaped element where the east wing \nvacated space at the ground level. This shift in the design also spoke \nto the campus development plan by partially dissolving the barrier \ncreated by this building between the Lister Complex and the University \namenities directly south of the complex.  The concept presented, also \nlooked at the possibility of reducing the overall building massing and \nheight by restricting the west wing to 5 storeys and the south wing to a \n6 storey mass. The building was situated as far to the south east of the \nsite in order to respect the residential neighbors to the west.\nMarch 22, 2016 Meeting\nThe Big Room meeting on March 22nd, revealed the design concept \nthat is the predecessor to what is found in the Schematic design report.  \nThis iteration of the design sequence responded to in depth discussions \nheld at the big room where a full size mock up of the resident’s rooms \nwas completed. The mock up revealed that fact that there was room to \ndecrease the size of the suite to reduce the overall area of the building \nand still maintain the usability and comfort that the students will be \nexpecting. The main floor also received some editing and explored \ndifferent placing of the amenities in order to gain the proper adjacencies \nand relationships of these spaces. The courtyard under the south \nwing was also developed to a more detailed state to start to explore \nthe possibilities of what this area might include to support the new \nbuilding and integrate the building into the campus fabric.  The March \n22nd meeting ended with a discussion about affordability and the cost \nof the design relative to the identified budget. It was at this point that \nthe project team identified key areas for review and reduction to try to \nreduce the cost of this option.\n2.\n0 \nA\nR\nC\nH\nIT\nEC\nTU\nR\nA\nL\nLister 5\nSchematic Design Report\n31\n2.\n0 \nA\nR\nC\nH\nIT\nEC\nTU\nR\nA\nL\nApril 6, 2016 Meeting\nWith the design of the building agreed to in principle, the meeting on \nApril 6, 2016 focused on alignment with the program and budget.  As the \nprevious design submitted on March 22nd, was deemed over budget \nbased on the dollars allocated in the RFP document, the April 6th design \nsubmission highlighted area reductions and main floor changes. The \nDesign team eliminated the ground floor landscape feature and replaced \nthis with student resident rooms.  Although rooms on the main floor \nwere considered less desirable, the trade off allowed the design team to \nreduce the height of the south wing by one level, to 5 storeys. Additional \nreductions to the suite sizes and the wall thickness between the rooms \nallowed the floor plate to be reduced even further. These changes \nalong with other  modifications to the plans realized a significant area \nreduction and thereby reduced the cost of the building substantially. \nLister 5\nSchematic Design Report\n32\nDESIGN EVOLUTION - LESSONS LEARNED \nIn the weeks leading up to the preparation of the presented Schematic \nDesign concept, the team presented numerous configuration and \nvisual images to test and guide the process toward the desired \noutcomes.

This \narea currently supports student parking for the Lister Centre and has an \noutdoor hockey rink installed adjacent the parking lot. The remainder of \nthe site is open park space with asphalt trails and pathways linking the \nHenday and Mackenzie halls to the rest of the campus circulation routes. \nThe Parcel of land selected by the U of A is of prime importance for the \nmain reason of proximity to the Lister Complex.  The goal of this project \nis to expand the Lister residence core and the only viable land available \nis the land to the south of the Centre. With this site being located to the \nsouth of the existing Lister centre, it is of critical importance to address \nthe existing towers and understand the relationship and impact that \nbuilding a tall building might have on the Henday and Mackenzie towers.  \nIt is for that very reason that the proposed design concept explored \na building that restricts its height, allowing the views and access to \nsunlight for the existing buildings to be maintained as much as possible. \nTopography\nThe existing site has a grade difference from high to low of approximately \n2 m (6 – 7 ft).  The design team has looked at this grade difference as \nan opportunity to use the grade difference and step the ground floor \nof the building and provide areas that would benefit from increased \nceiling height in locations at the lowest grade elevation of the site. This \nallows the program spaces such as the Multi-purpose room, fitness \nand classrooms, to have increased volumes to enhance the program \nelements.  The lower grade also allows for an at grade access point to \nthe Mackenzie tower and ultimately to the Lister complex from the new \nLister 5 residence at a level that directly links all the residence towers \nand the main Lister centre building. As the site progresses south, the \ngrades rise and come up to the street level, so too does the building \ngrade level floor. Through a series of ramps, the main floor rises and \ntransitions from a more public social space, and rises a second time to \ncreate a more community minded resident accommodation area.  The \ngrading of the site is proposed to be maintained as much as possible, \nhowever re-grading on the south side of the new building will need to \noccur in order to keep the main floor grade transition to a manageable \nchange.  \nLister 5\nSchematic Design Report\n34\n2.\n0 \nA\nR\nC\nH\nIT\nEC\nTU\nR\nA\nL\nWind\nThe City of Edmonton is located in the area that is impacted by \nthe upper level westerlies.

Cold temperatures brought in by winds from the \nnorth, produce snow and blizzard conditions and can be expected \nyear to year but are not frequent and do not last for long periods \nof time.\nRain Fall / Precipitation\nEdmonton, Alberta can expect on average, 460 mm of rainfall per \nyear or 40 mm of rainfall per month. The rainfall is distributed over  \nan average of 122 days per year, each having more than .1 mm \nof rain or 10.2 days with a quantity of rain, sleet snow etc. Novem-\nber is considered the driest month of the year with the average \nprecipitation accumulation of 16.1 mm.  July is found to be the \nwettest month of the year when expected accumulation of rainfall \nis approximately 95mm.\nAverage Temperatures\nThe mean temperature in Edmonton is recorded at a cool 3.6 de-\ngrees Celsius, with a mean monthly temperature variation of 30 \ndegrees\tCelsius.\t\tThe\tfluctuation\t/\trange\tof\ttemperatures\ton\tthe\t\naverage day is approximately 10 deg. Celsius, with the average \nday in July being the warmest days at 17.5 degrees Celsius, and \nJanuary days being the coldest with an average temperature of \n-12.5 degree Celsius. \nLister 5\nSchematic Design Report\n35\n2.\n0 \nA\nR\nC\nH\nIT\nEC\nTU\nR\nA\nL\nDESIGN CONCEPT\nThe project objectives articulated by the University of Alberta at \nthe beginning of the project formed the basis for the design concept \nincluded in this report.\n“Transformation and community as the focus”\nContext / Building Placement\n1. The building has been organized in an “L” shape configuration to \ncreate new exterior spaces that are also an extension of the existing \nnetwork of outdoor spaces. \n2. The building has been carefully placed to allow enough distance \nbetween the new building, MacKenzie and Henday. Privacy, sun \npenetration and views have defined the proposed location. In \naddition to these parameters, the servicing strategy has also been \nconsidered in the shaping of the massing. The incoming electrical \nservices are anticipated to come from MacKenzie, while the \nmechanical services are anticipated to come from the utility corridor \nalong the east side of the site.\n3. The building massing has been shaped to create a link between \nMacKenzie Tower and the new building. This link is as an extension \nof the network of student spaces that is currently under review \nby the University of Alberta as a parallel project. The master plan \nprocess and relocation of social spaces has been key to the design \nevolution of the ground floor plan of the new building.  The main \namenity spaces that are intended to serve the building population \nand spaces that can be shared by the larger Lister complex have \nbeen placed on the ground floor along the west wing.\n4. The building has also been shaped to address vehicular access along \nthe south. Parking and drop-off have been located adjacent to the \nroad along the south. This area will also function as the seasonal \nloading area for residents moving in and out.\n5. The building height and program distribution have been carefully \nconsidered to minimize the impact on the adjacent Lister towers \nand maximize privacy and sun penetration into the open spaces \nseparating the new building from the existing buildings. The building \narea has been distributed within five floors and a mechanical \npenthouse structure along the west side of the volume.  The low \nbuilding height is also responsive the residential community west of \n116th street.\n“Reinforce community in all aspects of the project”\nSpatial Organization\n1. The typical floor plan accommodates 4 houses or clusters. A house \nis defined as a group of bedrooms that include 27 students and a \nresident assistant. These bedrooms include double rooms as well as \nsingle rooms.\n2. The typical floor layout also includes study rooms, lounges and \nwashrooms that are shared by the 4 houses across the floor. The \nbedrooms, study rooms and lounges have been organized along the \nbuilding perimeter to maximize access to natural light.\n3. The massing configuration and typical floor layout are driven by \nthe concept of creating a sense of community at the floor level \nwhere there is a careful balance of privacy and a desire to create \nopportunities for different kinds of interaction.\n4. The bedrooms are organized along single loaded corridors that \nare separated from the other bedrooms by the introduction of \ncentral shared washrooms. The corridors have been designed to \nbe generous in width, short in length with views to the outside \nand interrupted by carefully placed social spaces such as the study \nrooms and lounges. \n5. The triangulation at the center of the wings is the result of a \ndeliberate attempt to create interesting spaces at the crossroads \nof corridors and social spaces. The triangulation also provides \nthe opportunity to interrupt potentially long corridors that have \na singular direction. The triangulation also allows for an efficient \nbalance of bedroom areas relative to support spaces that don’t \nrequire natural light such as the washrooms.\n6. The washrooms have been designed as opportunities for social \ninteraction. The design is based on the principles of equality and \naccessibility. All washrooms have been designed to be gender-\nneutral and fully accessible.\n7. Vertical integration is also key to creating a strong community. \nStairs have been centrally located along the building perimeter. \nThey are located at the entrance connection to MacKenzie, at the \ncrossroads between the east and west wings and at the east end of \nthe building. Interior and exterior glazing will support wayfinding. \nGlazing will provide natural light into the stairwells to create spaces \nthat encourage students to use the stairs as the main access to the \nupper floors rather than the elevators.\n8. The ground floor amenity spaces have been organized to follow \na progression of public (open to the larger campus community) \nto semi-public spaces (related to the Lister 5 community).  The \nMacKenzie connection is aligned with the interior galleria or \ngenerous corridor space overlooking the central green space. The \ngalleria provides access to a sequence of amenity spaces that \nincludes the multipurpose room, the classroom, fitness area, games \nroom and individual study spaces. The south end of the galleria \ncontains the living room/parlor and central kitchen space or central \ngathering space. This space is the heart of the Lister 5 community \nwhere faculty and students will congregate.\n9. The east side of the ground floor resembles the organization of the \ntypical upper floor but also accommodates other functions such as \nbike storage and the residence coordinator apartment.\nLister 5\nSchematic Design Report\n36\nExterior Building Expression\nThe exterior façade design follows the planning concepts.  Natural light \nis critical to creating livable communities. The typical room has been \ndesigned to allow for continuous glazing along the width of the room. A \nlinear window extends from wall to wall within the room and it has been \nprovided with operable windows. \nThis window arrangement is expressed on the outside as a linear window \narrangement that is interrupted by the study and lounge spaces and \nstair volumes.\nThe lounges and study rooms are located at the intersection of the \ntriangular shapes of the plan and are intended to have a singular \nexpression on the outside that is recognizable. They have floor to ceiling \nglass to maximize the access to natural light given the nature of the \nfunctions within it. \nDifferent cladding materials are currently being explored including \naluminum composite panels, fiber cement panels and painted metal \npanels in combination with exterior glazing.\n2.\n0 \nA\nR\nC\nH\nIT\nEC\nTU\nR\nA\nL\nPRECEDENT: ST.

The University has requested a minimum threshold of a 3 \nout of 5 green globe rating to be the benchmark for sustainable design, \nand a desire to push the design team with the challenge of attaining \na 4 green globe rating while still maintaining the project budget and \nschedule. In order to achieve the 3 green globe rating, an overall score \nof 55-69% must be achieved in the pursuit of the sustainable initatives. \nIn order to achieve a 4 globe rating, the project must achieve 70-84% \nsuccess.  Currently the design team has begun the pre-design process \nwith the Green Globe rating system and the mandate of a 3 green globe \nrating appears to be achievable.  As the process moves forward, the \ndesign team will test the sustainability concepts against the green globe \nrating system and determine the best and most valuable means and \nmethods to see if the 4th green globe is achievable with in the design \nand budget parameter provided.  \nSome of the sustainable design considerations and concepts include:\n• Building envelope efficiency.\n• Energy usage and selection of systems.\n• Selection of products and materials.\n• Connection and use of existing infrastructure.\n• Natural lighting characteristics.\n• Access to views, both from the building and adjacent buildings.\n• Planning for future sustainable concepts that might be employed \nafter the project is completed.\nLister 5\nSchematic Design Report\n38\n2.\n0 \nA\nR\nC\nH\nIT\nEC\nTU\nR\nA\nL\nLIFE SAFETY\nThe purpose of the code review is to maintain the life and fire safety \nrequirements intrinsic in to the design process and make sure that the \nproposed schematic design concept will meet all applicable life safety \nand fire codes as set out in the 2014 Alberta Building Codes.

Some advantages and disadvantages to these structural \nsystems are as follows.\nCast-in-place Concrete\nAdvantages:\n• Availability of trades\n• Reduced floor and roof structure depths relative to other       systems\n• Durable structure\n• Future flexibility as walls can easily be removed\n• Future flexibility of roof to accommo date mechanical upgrades or \nsolar panel installation\n• Low maintenance requirements\n• Fire rating is inherent in the structure (Non-combustible)\n• No transfer slab required at the second floor level\nDisadvantages:\n• Slightly longer on-site construction period\n• Winter construction requires heating and hoarding\nLight-gauge Steel Framing\nAdvantages:\n• Steel studs do not warp, rot or shrink\n• Steel is a highly recyclable material\n• Steel is weakened by fire but does not burn.  Steel can with stand \nfire longer than timber prior to collapsing\n• Less wastage of materials relative to timber frame                               con-\nstruction\n• Durable structure\n• Low maintenance requirements\nDisadvantages:\n• Limited qualified trades\n• Less future flexibility as walls are a part of the structural         system\n• Less future flexibility of the roof to deal with future mechanical up-\ngrades or solar panel installation\n• Heavy transfer slab required at the second floor\n• Floor system deeper relative to cast-in-place concrete option\n• Requires additional finishings compared to cast-in-place       concrete \noption (ie. gypsum ceilings)\n• Relies on gypsum for fire rating\n• Structural steel required to frame large open areas.  Structural steel \ntrade different from light gauge steel trade so additional coordina-\ntion challenges exist\n• Lots of upfront coordination required, as construction                    ad-\nvances more difficulty to make architectural revisions\nTimber Construction\nAdvantages:\n• Timber framing is the least expensive option to construct\n• Availability of trades\n• Quick erection time\n• Wood is recyclable and renewable\nDisadvantages:\n• Wood is combustible and timber  requires a high level of       quality \ncontrol to achieve required fire rating\n• Relies on gypsum for fire rating\n• Firewalls will be required so there will be less openness on upper \nfloors\n• Additional maintenance of the building will be required                 re-\nsulting from shrinkage of the wood\n• Less future flexibility as walls are a part of the structural           system\n• Less future flexibility of the roof to deal with future mechanical up-\ngrades or solar panel installation\n• Heavy transfer slab required at the second floor\n• Floor system deeper relative to cast-in-place concrete option\n• Requires additional finishings compared to cast-in-place       concrete \noption (ie. gypsum ceilings)\n• Structural steel required to frame large open areas.  Structural steel \ntrade different from light gauge steel trade so additional coordina-\ntion challenges exist.  Also, differential shrinkage existing when steel \nis introduced into the structure.\nThe recommended structural component is cast-in-place concrete.  Cast-\nin-place concrete is an excellent structural system that can be custom \ndesigned to meet stringent vibration and deflection specifications as \nwell as provide good acoustic values and fire resistance.\nThe structural system has been recommended to reduce on-going \nmaintenance costs.\nGreen Design\nConsideration has been given to structural materials with high recycled \nmaterial content.  Recycled materials such as fly ash will be specified for \nuse in the concrete mix designs.\nLister 5\nSchematic Design Report\n71\n3.\n0 \nST\nR\nU\nC\nTU\nR\nA\nL\nDESIGN CRITERIA\nThe structural design is to be undertaken in accordance with the latest \ncodes and standards, including but not limited to:\n•\t Alberta Building Code 2014 Edition (ABC 2014)\n•\t Structural Steel Design CAN/CSA-S16\n•\t Reinforced Concrete Design CAN/CSA-A23.3\n•\t Cold Formed Steel Design CSA S136\n•\t Wood Design CSA 086\nDesign Dead Load\nThe structural design dead load is to incorporate the actual anticipated \nloads in various designated areas.

The rationale for engaging in sus-\ntainable design is to create a facility that will contribute to reduced \ndemands on the earth resources. There are four areas that are im-\npacted by engaging Green Globe practices into electrical systems \nincluding:\n• energy conservation,\n• renewable energy usage,\n• light pollution reduction, and\n• indoor environmental quality.\nSustainability design for the Lister 5 Residence will be considered \nbased on how Facilities and Operations can maintain these sys-\ntems and have the budgets to sustain the systems for operations \nand replacement of these systems. Further review of these sys-\ntems will be required during the next phase of design.\nIn discussions with the University of Alberta, a sub-metering system \nwill not be required on each floor. Metering will only be provided \nat the service entrance.\nOther sustainable design options to be considered for review are:\na. Photovoltaics: \ni. Further review is required to determine the feasibility of using PV \narrays. \nii. A two (2) inch conduit could be routed to the roof for future con-\nsideration.\nEnergy Conservation\nElectrical energy comprises a small portion of the total energy con-\nsumed by a facility but when expressed in actual utility costs, the \nelectrical system consumes approximately 20 - 40% of the total \nbuilding’s energy budget. The following initiatives will be adopted \nin the design to reduce the building’s energy consumption:\n1. Use the latest illumination technology including a combination of \nLED and fluorescent.\n2. The Minimum Energy Performance prerequisite in Green Globes is \nintended to comply with the minimum level of energy efficiency as \nspecified in latest version of ASHRAE 90.1.\n3. Other measures that can further improve the baseline energy per-\nformance is the use of occupancy sensors, dimming controls, pho-\ntocells, and improved local controls. An interface to the Univer-\nsity’s building automation system (BACNet) will optimize the use \nLister 5\nSchematic Design Report\n89\n5.\n0 \nEL\nEC\nTR\nIC\nA\nL\nof lighting and ventilation systems when a space is occupied and \nreduced usage when spaces are not occupied. \n4. Engineered lighting systems to provide appropriate lighting levels \nthat are safe and effective. Lighting will comply with prescribed \nguidelines rather than using light levels that are on the high end \nof the IESNA (Illuminating Engineering Society of North America) \nstandard. It is proposed that lower ambient lighting levels be em-\nployed in offices, suites, circulation spaces, and corridors.\n5. The following non-Green Globes energy efficient design parame-\nters will be considered:\n6. Use of soft start or VFDs for larger motor loads to help reduce peak \npower demand.\n7. Power distribution centres will be located as close as possible to \ntheir connected loads, thereby minimizing the length of branch cir-\ncuit wiring which in turn will improve the voltage regulation.\n8. Designated equipment to have “manual-off-automatic” con-\ntrols such that they can be run in manual mode or automatically \nthrough the building management system.\n9. The design will favor the use of environmentally friendly compo-\nnents such as LED lamps which have no mercury content.\nLighting Control of Perimeter and Non-Perimeter Spaces\nAn option discussed with the University of Alberta was to consider \nan advanced digital lighting control system technology but wasn’t \ndeemed viable for this type of building.  \nA line voltage control system with occupancy and daylight sensors will \nbe used in combination throughout this building with a connection \nto the BMS system.  \nELECTRICAL SYSTEMS\nService\nA 13.8kV primary service will be provided from Lister Centre into \nUniversity of Alberta provided high-voltage switchgear and pad-\nmounted 13.8kV / 208V transformer\nPower Distribution System Design\nThe total calculated demand load for Lister 5 Residence is estimated \nat approximately 330kW based on a building size of 109,000 ft2. A \n1600A, 120/208V service is estimated but the calculated demand \nloads and historic peak demand of the other Lister residences will \nneed to be further reviewed with University of Alberta Electrical \nUtilities to determine a suitable size pad-mounted transformer \nand main distribution panel.\nMain Electrical Room \nIn the earlier phases of development of the program space, the main \nelectrical room was located at the north end of the building.  It was \nthen relocated to be more central to reduce the feeder lengths to \nthe upper floor distribution and to the main mechanical room.\nThe main electrical room will consist of a high voltage room housing \nthe 13.8kV service entry rated switchgear and a medium voltage \nroom housing a 120/208V, 3 phase 4 wire main distribution panel.\nThe Lister 5 Residence service entrance switchgear will be metal en-\nclosed 15kV rated indoor style load break fused switching devices \nand vacuum circuit breakers.  All low voltage switchgear (208V) \nwill be metal-enclosed indoor rated, with withdrawable-type pow-\ner-air circuit breakers complete with programmable protective re-\nlays.  \nLister 5\nSchematic Design Report\n90\n5.\n0 \nEL\nEC\nTR\nIC\nA\nL\nNormal Power Distribution:\nThe standard operating, distribution and utilization voltages for Lister \n5 Residence will be 120/208V, 3-phase, 4-wire. A sufficient num-\nber of 120/208V panelboards will be located in the suite areas \nto maintain required voltage levels.  The panelboards will have a \nminimum of 25% spare for future use.\nEmergency Power Distribution:\nAll life safety systems will be backed up by battery units for lighting, \nexit lighting and fire alarm systems. \nGrounding and Bonding\nGrounding system has been designed to provide a low impedance path \nfor ground fault currents to flow. \nEach of the electrical rooms will have a grounding bus connected to \nthe building’s main system ground, which in turn will be con-\nnected to the ground grid.  All non-current-carrying metal parts \nof equipment in the electrical rooms will be bonded to ground \nper Canadian Electrical Code.  This will include all metal raceways, \nequipment enclosures, metal structures, low tension systems, and \nmiscellaneous metal systems.  A bonding conductor will be pro-\nvided in each conduit.\nEach of the telecommunication rooms will have a grounding bus con-\nnected to the building’s main system ground, which in turn will be \nconnected to the ground grid.     \nGeneral Wiring\nAll wiring will be installed in conduit. Copper wiring is recommended \nto be used in this facility however aluminum wiring has been ac-\ncepted as a cost saving initiative on conductors larger than 200A \non previous projects and should be considered for this project.\nThe use of cable tray systems will only be used in accessible ceiling \nspaces where required.\nAlternate wiring methods being considered are as follows:\na. Aluminum wiring to be considered for conductors 200A and larger.\nCabling for life safety systems such as elevators, fire alarm systems, \netc. will be minimum one-hour fire rated.  \nDrive-rated cables will be used from VFD’s to the motors when they \nare separated by more than 10m of cable length from the VFD’s.\nLighting\nThe lighting system will be designed to provide for the functional re-\nquirements of the installation. The Illuminating Engineering So-\nciety of North America (IESNA) standards and the University of \nAlberta lighting design guide will be the key references.  Estab-\nlished standards and parameters for a residential facility will be \nused for the design as they apply to specific areas; however these \nstandards and parameters may be altered to achieve Green Globes \ncertification. Energy consumption considerations and lighting lev-\nels will be carefully weighed with the benefits of achieving a Green \nGlobes certification.\nThe lighting system for the Lister 5 Residence will be designed to pro-\nvide integration of numerous lighting techniques to provide vi-\nbrant and attractive atmosphere that is both inviting and engaging \nfor the people within the space. It is the intent to provide layered \nlighting within public circulation and gathering areas that will en-\nhance the building’s profile on campus. It will both augment and \nadd to the architectural elements of the space in providing a visu-\nally stimulating environment that is comfortable and welcoming. \nIt is the intention that the design will integrate the various aspects \nof the lighting system with the building’s space functions, mechan-\nical systems, and architectural elements.  Integration of natural \nlight captured by the building will take on a key role in achieving \ndesired illumination.\nThe basis of design will include LED luminaires within the suites and \nfluorescent lighting in all other areas throughout the facility.\nLighting Control System\nAll building lighting will be controlled to decrease energy use, allow \nflexibility, and to meet the requirements of the University of Al-\nberta. The lighting control system will be a line voltage system \nwith a combination of local and automatic controls that will inter-\nface with the Building Automation System. Controls will include: \ni. Occupancy sensors will be provided in all public areas including \ncorridors, social spaces, washrooms, and similar spaces.\nii. Storage rooms and utility rooms to be complete with local on/off \ncombination occupancy sensor switch. \niii. Suites: Lighting control within suites to be a combination switch/\nsensor with ‘vacancy’ setting; manual on, auto off.\niv. Central time clock control. All general building lighting, with the \nexception of suites and low-usage areas will be controlled using a \ncentral time clock via the BMS system. \nv. Daylight sensors will be considered for the perimeter spaces, \nrecreation room, fitness room, upper floor corridors and social \nspaces. This daylight control will either shut off the nearest fix-\nture to the windows or dim the luminaires in these areas.\nThe control system is being provided to meet the requirements of \nthe Green Globes program and intended to not only increase user \ncomfort and ease of maintenance, but to reduce the energy usage \nin the building. \nFire Alarm System\nThe fire alarm system will be a single-stage, annunciated, class \nA-wired and electrically supervised system.  Zoning of the fire \nalarm system will be based on smoke zone subdivision. System \nLister 5\nSchematic Design Report\n91\ndevices will be of the addressable type and will consist of manual \npull station, products-of-combustion detectors, thermal detectors, \nand sprinkler flow valves.\nFire alarm sounding devices will be of the audible and visual (strobe) \ntype in compliance with the latest Alberta Barrier-Free Code re-\nquirements. \nMain Fire Alarm Control Panel will be located in the Main Telecommu-\nnication Room; Main Fire Alarm Annunciator Panel will be located \nat the main south entrance.\nNo fire phones will be provided.\nIn-suite notification devices will a speaker/strobe combination device \ncapable of broadcasting a mass notification message; note that \nsuite signaling will include a speaker circuit dedicated to the suites \n(per floor) and a separate speaker circuit (per floor) dedicated to \ncommon areas.\nSmoke detectors will be used in all suites and connected to the main \nfire alarm system.\nThe fire alarm system will also be interconnected into the campus \nwide FM Net system and Mass Notification System.\nThe network connection will be at the FACP, not the annunciator. The \nFAAP will be a standard transponder interface annunciator only. It \nwill require a dedicated 120V circuit, and will consist of an 8-line \ndisplay, remote microphone, control switches for paging and by-\npasses, and a spare tub for mounting a graphic.  FACP will include \nthe same functionality (display, microphone, switches, graphic, \netc.).\n5.\n0 \nEL\nEC\nTR\nIC\nA\nL\nLOW TENSION SYSTEMS\nThis section of the report discusses the various low tension and se-\ncurity systems that are envisioned to be installed in the Lister 5 \nResidence.\nSecurity Systems\nSecurity design discussions to date have been captured below but will \nalso require further review after a CPTED review is completed.  \nAccess Control System\nAt the present, the project will allow for the installation of conduit and \ncabling system complete with all necessary power supplies.  De-\nvices and head-end equipment will be provided by the University \nof Alberta.\nCard access control will be provided at the following locations:\no Mackenzie hall entrance\no Exterior recycling entrance\no East entrance\no Interior passages into east wing on main floor x 2\no Elevators\no All perimeter doors complete with door contacts for monitoring to \nbe confirmed w RCMS.\nCCTV System \nCamera locations will be provided complete w conduit and cabling \nto the nearest communication room.

It was also identified that there is a need to \nprovide floor boxes to allow for more flexibility within common \nlounge spaces for power connections.\nAt this phase in the design power, data and coax locations will be pro-\nvided within the following areas:\n• Multi-purpose room – data and coax connections \n• Fitness room – coax locations for TVs\n• Common lounge spaces – data and coax connections on the perim-\neter as well as floor boxes for the table locations.\n• Study areas – data and coax connections on the perimeter as well \nas floor boxes underneath the tables.\n• All suites – to be provided w one data and one coax per desk loca-\ntion, as per attached drawing\nEmergency Blue Phone system\nAdditional blue phones locations may be required to meet the overall \ncampus requirements and based on a CPTED review.  The existing \nblue phone may need to be relocated to a new location if identi-\nfied in the CPTED review.\nClock System\nGPS wireless clock system will not be provided.\nPublic Address system\nA stand-alone building wide public address system will not be pro-\nvided.\nLister 5\nSchematic Design Report\n92\n5.\n0 \nEL\nEC\nTR\nIC\nA\nL\nMass Notification System\nA Mass Notification system will be deployed throughout the facility \nand will be fully integrated with the Campus wide system con-\nnected through the fire alarm system interface.  The system will \nincorporate text to speech functionality through the fire alarm sys-\ntem speakers.\nCommunication Infrastructure\nIncoming service will be provided by the Electrical Contractor via con-\nduit and fibre fed from Lister Centre. The University will terminate \nthe cabling at both ends.\nMain Communication Room – Service Entrance\nMain Communication room – will be located centrally within the main \nfloor to house telephone/data, demarcation point, fire alarm, FM \nNet system, shaw head end and security head end systems.\nCommunication Rooms\nSub Communication Rooms – will be located in both East and West \nwings on each floor.\nWhere required the Sub Communication Rooms will be provided with \nadditional data racks to allow for data terminations on upper floors \nand house IP-based building access and controls, fire alarm and se-\ncurity systems.  Rack locations will be provided as required to ac-\ncommodate the data cabling distance limitations.\nInitial discussions with the University of Alberta IST group for review \nand coordination of services has commenced and will evolve into \nthe next phase of design.\nStructured Cabling Pathways\nCommunications cabling will be installed in conduits and routed to the \nnearest zone box. A larger conduit will be provided to route back to \nthe nearest communication room. All conduit for communication \nsystems shall be EMT (electrical metallic tubing).  Flex conduit is \nnot permitted. Minimum conduit size for voice/data outlets will \nbe 27 mm. Maximum fill ratio is 40% per the Telecommunication \nIndustry Association standards.    \nRouting of horizontal structured cabling will be accomplished by uti-\nlizing a conduit and zone box system within the corridors.

Motor control centres of the grouped \ndesign should be utilized where large quantities of mechanical \nequipment are located such as at wet mechanical rooms, pent-\nhouses, etc. In order to reduce capital costs of equipment and al-\nlow more effective use of mechanical room space, VFD controlled \nmotor loads will be fed from Distribution Centres (CDP) rather than \nMotor Control Centres.  Energy consumption of all HVAC loads is \nrequired to be measured for the Green Globes measurement and \nverification credit.\nThe variable speed drive starters (VFDs) and electrical equipment to \nbe grouped away from wet, dusty, or hot areas.  \nManual controls will be provided for all plumbing fixtures.  No electri-\ncal will be provided for any infrared fixtures.\nOPPORTUNITIES TO BE CONSIDERED\n.1 It was initially discussed that a fire pump would be needed for fire \nprotection. If an electric fire pump is considered, a 150kW emer-\ngency generator will be provided to back up the fire pump, ele-\nvator and life safety systems.  The self-contained exterior diesel \ngenerator will be complete with a 24 hour sub-base fuel tank and \nsound attenuated enclosure. Emergency panels will be located in \nthe floor communication rooms to serve the life safety systems on \nthat floor.\nFurther review deemed that a fire pump is not required but University \nof Alberta to confirm if a generator is deemed necessary.\n.2 LED lighting throughout the building to be considered to reduce \nthe long term maintenance costs and energy consumption.  \nThis options was discussed with the University of Alberta but was \ndeemed not viable due to insignificant cost savings and \n.3 Alternate wiring methods:\n.1 Aluminum wiring to be considered for conductors 150A and larger.\nFurther discussions with the University indicated that this would be a \nviable option to consider.\nAPPENDIX\nPower Demand Calculation\nElectrical System Responsibility Matrix\nESK-E1 – Electrical Site Plan\nESK-E2 – Main Electrical and Communications Room Layout\nESK-E3 – Typical Room Layouts\nESK-E4 – Preliminary Single Line Diagram\nESK-E5 – Preliminary Single Line Diagram\nLister 5\nSchematic Design Report\n94\n5.\n0 \nEL\nEC\nTR\nIC\nA\nL\nELECTRICAL SIYSTEM RESPONSIBILITY MATRIX\nLister 5\nSchematic Design Report\n95\nELECTRICAL SITE PLAN\n5.\n0 \nEL\nEC\nTR\nIC\nA\nL\nLister 5\nSchematic Design Report\n96\n5.\n0 \nEL\nEC\nTR\nIC\nA\nL\nMAIN ELECTRICAL AND COMMUNICATION ROOM LAYOUT\nLister 5\nSchematic Design Report\n97\n5.\n0 \nEL\nEC\nTR\nIC\nA\nL\nTYPICAL ROOM LAYOUTS\nLister 5\nSchematic Design Report\n98\n5.\n0 \nEL\nEC\nTR\nIC\nA\nL\nPRELIMINARY SINGLE LINE DIAGRAM\nLister 5\nSchematic Design Report\n99\nPRELIMINARY SINGLE LINE DIAGRAM\n5.\n0 \nEL\nEC\nTR\nIC\nA\nL\nLister 5\nSchematic Design Report\n100\nLister 5\nSchematic Design Report\n101\n6.0 SITE DEVELOPMENT\nLister 5\nSchematic Design Report\n102\n6.\n0 \nSI\nTE\n D\nEV\nEL\nO\nPM\nEN\nT\nExisting Development Area\nThe proposed site is located south of the existing Lister Complex \nin a landscaped area that currently contains mature trees, areas of \nestablished sod, an outdoor beach volleyball court, an outdoor ice rink \nwith shack and asphalt trails traversing the site. On the south side of the \nlandscaped site area is an asphalt parking lot that currently serves the \nLister Complex students. \nLandscape, Grading and Civil Servicing Design Goals\nThe surrounding area and neighbourhood is comprised of a variety of \ntree species that are mature and large in scale.  The relative distance \nbetween the construction zone and existing mature trees should allow \nmany of the existing trees to remain undisturbed.  A project design \npriority is to maintain and protect as many of the existing trees as \npossible and devise creative alternatives that assist in this pursuit.\nexamined to determine the best options for re-routing.  Once again, of \nprimary importance is minimizing site disruption, damage to existing \ntrees in conjunction with uninterrupted utility service from existing \nUniversity buildings and facility operations.\nLandscape Design\nThe new Lister 5 development will however require removal of some \nexisting sod and mature trees.  New landscape elements will attempt to \nminimize this impact and enhance the natural ambiance that students \ncurrently enjoy.  \nNew plantings will primarily focus on the residence areas of the ground \nlevel of the new building. The residential suites will require privacy \nscreening to separate ground level activities and the public from the \nstudent’s personal activities and required privacy. In addition to this \nrequirement, the landscape design must follow the CPTED rules and \nallow for supervision on the perimeter of the building while not creating \nareas that may pose threats to the student’s wellbeing or security.\nThe preliminary design concept will include a combination of planting \nelements and fencing hardscape to create visual filters to each of the \nresidential suites.  The Faculty apartments will have the same treatment, \nbut include for an exterior yard area to allow the resident of these units \nthe opportunity to have some exterior personal space. As well the West \nedge of the building and site will be designed in a manner that will blend \nthe new building across the park space and filter out the impact to the \nexisting residential community that is well established in the area.\nThe design approach for the surrounding landscape areas outside of \nthe immediate privacy zone of the new building is currently planned \nfor remediation work, restoring the sod areas back to grassy spaces. \nAs part of the ongoing detailed design process, the design team will \ndiscuss with the stakeholders, the option and potential future uses that \nmight be desired in the community space between the existing and new \nbuildings, as well as identifying any opportunities that might be desired \nto connect this site to the whole of the Campus infrastructure.\nAdditionally, landscape elements will be organized in tandem with the \ncivil grading design to take full advantage of drainage patterns and keep \nplantings out of areas not conducive to healthy plant development.\nSite Grading \nNorth to south, the low elevation of the existing Henday base floor, \nexisting pathway and associated grade elevations were a consideration \nThe existing site slopes gradually east to west and only slightly south \nto north until beyond the outdoor rink where the slope drops off \nmore dramatically toward Mackenzie Hall. These grade differences \npose challenges as well as opportunities. By taking advantage of the \nnatural grade site disruption can be minimized. This reduces required \nconstruction efforts which conserves resources and aids in reducing the \nproject’s environmental impact.\nAs important will be developing synergies between grading and function \nto ensure safety, security, maintainability and usability of all outdoor \nspaces and transitions to building access points.\nRunoff water from rain fall and melting snow will be diverted away from \nthe building’s perimeter and will be captured and removed from the site \nutilizing as much of the existing storm piping infrastructure as possible.\nSimilarly, underground sanitary and water infrastructure will be \nLister 5\nSchematic Design Report\n103\nin setting the proposed Lister 5 connector floor elevation lower.  This \nallows a greater ceiling height which promotes development of a \nwelcoming space as pedestrians enter Lister 5 from Mackenzie Hall.  \nBecause the existing grade increases quickly moving south, a lower floor \nelevation along the north/south orientation requires that the grades \naround the building be faded back to match the existing landscape.  \nEast to West, as the grade transitions lower, again floor elevations can \nset such that gathering spaces can be provided with higher ceiling \nheights than other more private spaces.\nCare must be exercised to establish floor elevations that also ensure \nadequate drainage around the building and prevent runoff from \nmigrating back toward the proposed building.  \nStorm Servicing\nThe current site is serviced by an existing 450mm storm service \nconnection to a 1225mm storm main along 117 Street.  \nAn existing 450mm storm pipe runs beneath the proposed N/S Lister #5 \nwing then runs parallel with the E/W wing.  The existing service supports \ndrainage areas from the north, east and south.  Catch basin and drainage \npiping from each of these directions will require either abandonment or \nre-routing to connect back with the 450mm storm service connection.  \nVarious servicing alternatives exist for site storm piping re-routing as \nillustrated below.\nThe possible replacement of a portion of the existing 450mm storm \npiping beneath the N/S wing of the building can be accomplished with \njoint-less, fusion welded HDPE piping. The advantages of fusion welded \npiping provide for very low risk of pipe leakage or cracking failure and \ndue to smooth inner surface and lack of connection seams offers the \nmost reliable long-term serviceability.  The fact that storm piping is \nunder no pressure and will be dry 99% of the time should provide a level \nof added comfort.  This routing option also avoids extensive disruption \nto the existing site from new, significantly deeper storm service runs \nthat would otherwise be necessary.\nA storm service from the proposed building will likely connect to the \n450mm storm manhole within the courtyard area.  The size of this \nconnection will be determined as the building design evolves.\n6.\n0 \nSI\nTE\n D\nEV\nEL\nO\nPM\nEN\nT\n4.96%\n4.97%\n4.75%\nEXISTING PARKING PAD\n17 STALLS\nTRANSFORMER ACCESS/\nLOADING\nWALKOUT TERRACE\nWALKOUT\nTERRACE\nPROPOSED FOOTPATHS\n11\n7 \nAv\nen\nue\n W\nMackenzie\nHall\nHenday\nHall\n1\n2 2a\n2b 3\n4\n4y 6\n7\n8\n5\n5x\n6x\n7x 8x\n9\n10\n11\n12\n9x\n10x\n11x\n12x\n13y\nA\nB\nC\nD\nE\nF\nG\nH\nJ\n13\n2X\n2y\n1X\n3x\n4x\nKx\nJx\nHx\nGx\nFx\nEx\nDx\nCx\nL\nM\nQ\nP\nN\nR\nRx\nQx\nMx\nLxAx\nBx\n13x\nHy\nGy\nDate:\nProject No:\nScale:\nISSUED\nCONTRACTOR MUST CHECK & VERIFY ALL DIMENSIONS ON THE JOB.\nDO NOT SCALE DRAWINGS.\nALL DRAWINGS, SPECIFICATIONS AND RELATED DOCUMENTS ARE THE COPYRIGHT PROPERTY OF\nTHE ARCHITECT AND MUST BE RETURNED UPON REQUEST.

We want to cook and have a break from Aramark.  Its an inconvenience bringing stuff down to main to cook.  Not all ppl (esp\nInternational) don't want to eat Caf food every day.  It's unrealistic to think that everyone will want to buy food every day.\nAxonometrics Ditto (with at least 1 full kitchen on each floor) - I don't want to be carrying kitchen supplies somewhere.\nAxonometrics A 2 element stove on each floor.\nAxonometrics The new layout is encouraging and useful to community bonding.\nLiving Room Will the cafeteria get bigger?\nLiving Room Glass wall from all floors looking into walkway!\nLiving Room It would be cool to see Lister have a dedicated indoor theatre for movies/sports with a higher quality projector & couches instead of small redundant study spaces.\nLiving Room A theatre!  YES!\nLiving Room How often would the windows be cleaned?\nLiving Room Floors need refrigeration even if meal plans change (for snacks and beverages) - is there space for that?\nLiving Room This whole area is going to smell.  Please add ventilation!  Not like Schaffer kitchens which get hot and smelly.  Garbage/Recycle smells as well.\nLiving Room Door for laundry needs security so non-residents can't access.\nLiving Room Cultural privacy associated with doing laundry!\nLiving Room Are there going to be sinks for hand-washing clothes?\nLiving Room Too far - possible theft and vandalization.  Not enough machines for a mass amount.\nLiving Room I wouldn't want to walk by people with my clean/dirty laundry all the way to and from elevators and stairs.\nLiving Room Ditto - (regarding not wanting to walk with clean/dirty laundry to and from elevators and stairs.)\nMackenzie Lobby Amenity Do residents/student groups have to pay to rent out these spaces?\nMackenzie Lobby Amenity Association space - is this for student groups in general or designated for certain groups?\nMackenzie Lobby Amenity Less treadmills, more weights.\nMackenzie Lobby Amenity The \"open\" concept is very inviting!\nMackenzie Lobby Amenity Would Lister 5 be advertized as a different price since it has different availabilities?\nResidence Hall Washrooms Option 1 is way better - more privacy and less smell\nResidence Hall Washrooms I like having separated showers and toilets\nResidence Hall Washrooms Option 1 is best - flexible and more choice\nResidence Hall Washrooms Option 1 is best because it separates for privacy\nResidence Hall Washrooms Having 2 bathrooms of each type would be a good solution.  Give the choice to students since there are 4 washroom spaces per floor.\nResidence Hall Washrooms If using 2+ gender neutral bathrooms per floor - long walk to one you feel comfortable with.\nSite Plan Name tower after a Canadian female astronaut.\nSite Plan Will need more sparking - especially for Move-In.\nSite Plan Bondar Hall\nSite Plan SRA Office?\nSite Plan Soundproofing?  Especially by common spaces?\nSite Plan Tennis court?\nSite Plan I would be willing to park a bit away from Lister if I knew I was able to go to a direct door first to drop off my stuff.\nSite Plan Loud noise from gym will probably affect study spaces and may present studying (soundproofing study rooms?)\nSite Plan Central organics/recycle bin can be on one or more floors - similar to in Cafeteria?\nSite Plan Laundry parade in front of lounge and kitchen?\nSite Plan A problem with the location of the laundry room is that students have to walk in front of their peers with that laundry in order to access it. 7.\n0 \nN\nEX\nT \nST\nEP\nS\nSTUDENT CONSULTATION \nCOMMENTS\nThe following chart is a \ncollection of the comments \nreceived during the student \nfocus group session.  These \ncomments will be used to \neducate the design moving \nforward into the Design \nDevelopment Phase\nLister 5\nSchematic Design Report\n118\nSite Plan Usable outdoor social and green space would be nice.\nSite Plan Noise from gym on floors above it.\nSite Plan Basketball and volleyball courts gone?\nSite Plan Exit to LRT?\nTypical Floor Amenity Where is the TV?\nTypical Floor Amenity I like big windows\nTypical Floor Amenity More comprehensive kitchenette : students should have more stoves/supplies to cook - encourage healthy eating & autonomy.\nTypical Floor Amenity Are there going to be plenty of power outlets?  Please put lots of power outlets for laptops!\nTypical Floor Amenity Power outlets everywhere!\nTypical Floor Amenity Agreed (to power outlets everywhere)\nTypical Floor Amenity In study room, plug ins at every desk are super helpful (because places like the Caf barely have any) with reasonable desks/tables around.\nTypical Floor Amenity Lister\nTypical Floor Amenity Need real kitchens for these with dietary restrictions and from other cultures.\nTypical Floor Amenity Precautions against furniture swapping, moving, stealing?\nTypical Floor Amenity Open common spaces with no walls is great!\nTypical Floor Amenity No kitchen on each floor?  It is very good for community building.  Oven!!!\nTypical Plans There should be a laundry room on each floor - awkward carrying clothes through the whole building.\nTypical Plans Preference for dietary restrictions/disorders/independent cooking on ground floor with large kitchen where these residents can make their own food in a safe cooking environment\nTypical Plans Improved internet in rooms and especially in common spaces would greatly improve studying and working.\nTypical Plans Providing bulletin boards and a dedicated space for posters/information in a central space will make providing updates easier\nTypical Plans Dynamics of 4 RA's per floor - will they work together well or how will the floor separate responsibilities?\nTypical Plans If 56 people per \"bowtie\" that is too many to form a community and 128 is waaay too big.\nTypical Plans I like the simple layout - very open.\nTypical Rooms Should not be columns in gym - multipurpose.\nTypical Rooms Are there closets or dressers?

The \nstudents’ academic experience is enriched by linking learning with other aspects of their lives, and \nmany institutional goals are met as they relate to student recruitment, retention and achievement. \nIn a time of competing needs and economic uncertainty, it is critical that our limited post-secondary \nresources be dedicated to those areas directly relating to student recruitment and achievement. That \nis why the provision of sufficient on-campus housing for learners is so important – because it \nsignificantly impacts and supports their academic success, directs limited resources to where they \nare needed most and assists institutions in meeting overall goals and objectives. \nIn order to improve access to the University of Alberta for rural Albertans, students from across \nCanada and abroad, and to further enhance its leadership development capacity, additional \naccessible and supportive purpose-built student housing is required.  \nIt is the goal of the University of Alberta to house up to 25 per cent of its full-time enrolment in \npurpose-built student housing on its various campuses. Furthermore, it is the goal of the University of \nAlberta to guarantee housing for all first-year students accepted by the university. \nThe 2016 Institutional Strategic Plan identifies the expansion of the student housing portfolio as a \nstrategic priority for the University of Alberta; reaffirming Ancillary Services’ long-term strategy for \nstudent housing (2015 – 2040 Strategy for Residences, May 2015). \nIssues \nFacilities and Operations is proposing to construct one of the last phases of student housing \ndevelopment in East Campus Village 9 (ECV 9) - 300 new bed spaces in a suite style building on the \neast side of 111 Street, between 89 Avenue and 90 Avenue. \nA total of six houses in the area must be removed to make room for the new development; per the \nUniversity’s Sector 8 Plan. Occupants in those houses will be relocated to other accommodation. \nThe proposed new building will feature individual, self-contained apartments in (32) six-bedroom and \n(27) four-bedroom configurations designed to be attractive to international, rural and graduate students.  \nThe buildings will contain the appropriate amount of amenity and/or programmable space required to \ndeliver support services for students and foster a sense of community. \nAs part of the community consultation process, the University has taken design options to the \ncommunity and students for input; Open House #1 - February 25, 2016 and Open House #2 - May 17, \n2016.  Student representatives also participated, along with university staff and the design build team, \nin a series of focused design meetings to review and revise the selected design build submission.  \nAttachment 1 \nKelly Hopkin, Manager Campus Architecture                     Page 2 of 2                                             May 26, 2016 \nThe proposed building concept plans being presented to GFC Facilities Development Committee are \nsimilar to the recently completed housing projects and are in alignment with the Sector 8 Sector Plan \nand also the Garneau Neighbourhood Infill Design Guidelines. The proposed development aims to \nrespect the existing tree-lined grid, front yard set-backs, pedestrian movements and the street entrance \noff of 89 and 90 Avenues, as well as the style of architecture in the neighbourhood.  Some of the \nneighbourhood architectural elements which have been incorporated into the concepts include: \n• Articulation of the front façade to soften and break up the continuous front-face/massing along 89 \nand 90 Avenues as well as along 111 Street; \n• Residential window styling; \n• Building materials and colour palette to reflect existing character and provide sustainable and \ndurable end product;  \n• Canopied entrances to create a porch-style entrance and provide protection from the elements; and \n• Landscape plans connecting proposed new layouts and spaces existing site features and \ntypography. \nThere is no new parking proposed for the ECV 9 residence but a car lay-by lane has been \ndeveloped for the east side of 111 Street to facilitate seasonal move-in activities along with access \nto the Ground Floor level from the east side central laneway. The project has exterior courtyards \nand interior student social and amenity spaces that front onto the north/south bicycle & pedestrian \npathway per the Sector 8 Plan.  \nConstruction Schedule \n• Site Mobilization - summer 2016 \n• Project Occupancy - fall 2018 \nSustainable Design \n• Green Globes (target of 3 globes) \nEast Campus Village (ECV) - ECV 9\nPreliminary Design Report\nFacili  es Development Commi  ee  -  May 26, 2016\nAttachment 2\nECV 9ECV 9\nPreliminary Design Report\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\n1.

Progressive changes over \nthe past decade have included the introduction of U-Passes for \nall students, increased staff usage of LRT between campuses, \nand other transportation demand management (TDM) \ninitiatives.  Recent university data show a marked decrease \nin parking demand, which supports a reduction in our total \nparking requirements.  The gradual progress towards our \ntarget of providing on-campus housing of 25 per cent of our \nfull-time enrolment population has also influenced the decline \nin vehicular access to North Campus.\nThe overall aspiration for transportation planning is to create \nan integrated transportation system that emphasizes non-\nvehicular movement, manages vehicular access, maximizes \npublic transit use and minimizes the impact of traffic on \nneighbouring communities.\nPEDESTRIAN AND BICYCLE \nCIRCULATION\nThe LRDP amendment maintains and augments the \npedestrian and bicycle circulation system of the North \nCampus.  It promotes an integrated approach to enhance \npedestrian and bicycle routes to improve intra-campus \nmovement and external access to the campus.  These \npathways are part of a larger open space strategy to connect \nsurrounding neighbours.\nThis network provides access from campus gateways and \nentrances, peripheral parking lots and transit locations to \nall areas of the campus.  Working closely with the City of \nEdmonton, the university is providing shared-use network \nroutes for both pedestrians and bicyclists.\nNorth Campus will be linked to community pedestrian and \nbicycle systems, and coordinated with City of Edmonton \nsystems to promote increased participation and safer use.\nWHAT IS A LONG RANGE \nDEVELOPMENT PLAN?\nThe Long Range Development Plan (LRDP) is responsive to \nthe University of Alberta’s Academic Plan, Strategic Research \nPlan and Strategic Business Plan.  It is, therefore, a flexible \ndocument rather than a rigid template or “master plan”.\nThe LRDP identifies a set of strategic planning principles that \nshould form the basis for achievement of the goals, objectives \nand strategies expressed in the academic, research and \nbusiness plans.  It identifies as well, how the university lands \nand facilities should be developed in response to these plans, \nand outlines the operational planning initiatives and guidelines \nthat will direct development.\nThe LRDP is the overall organizing framework for \ndevelopment and is approved by the Board of Governors as the \nguiding document for physical planning.\nLAND USE\nThe University of Alberta has been a successful post-\nsecondary teaching, learning and research institution since \nits founding in 1908.  Its North Campus has remained in \ncontinuous development, use and renewal for more than 100 \nyears to serve its expanding academic mission and vision.\nTo be effective, a land use plan needs to be grounded in sound \nsmart growth and planned community principles.  The land \nuse plan also needs to engender resilience in adapting to \nchanging demographics, space needs, functional programs, \nevolving pedagogy, social and flexible learning space \nrequirements, and also changing mandates and expectations \nfrom the Ministry of Advanced Education, as well as funding \npartners and requirements.\nA healthy and complete campus means a mixture of land \nuses: teaching and research, residential, recreational and \nservices uses, integrated within buildings and across campus \nproperties.  It means having a campus where students, faculty \nand staff can feel at home and provide for their daily campus \nneeds.

Among the goals of \nthe university will be to ensure sufficient quality student \nhousing for up to 25% of full-time equivalent students.\nOPEN SPACE SYSTEM\nThe campus open space system is composed of tree-lined \nboulevards, walkways, paths, quads, courtyards, commons, \nplazas, building entries, sculptures, art, commemorative \nplaques,lights and various landscape features in addition \nto open fields and active recreation areas.  Together it is a \nmedium that connects individuals to the present and past \nexperiences and achievements of the university in social, \nhistorical and emotional realms.\nThe campus open space system is the connectivity system \nfor the entire university campus by balancing increased \ndensity, improving livability and reinforcing a sense of \ncommunity.  It underpins and supports the public realm \nwhere campus life, activities, rituals and celebrations of \nthe institution occur.  In addition, it provides the necessary \ncirculation movement, air, natural light, cultural and natural \nlandscapes, contributing to the health and wellness of \nthe university’s physical space.  Its physicality, geographic \nspatial breadth, connection to the history, legacy and \ncommunity building give the campus a complexity of \nmeaning, a sense of place and identity unique to this \ncampus.\nExcerpts from Long Range Development Plan, \nNorth Campus Amendment, March 2014\nECV 9ECV 9\nPreliminary Design Report\nOPEN HOUSE #1  -  BOARD 7\nResearch & Collections Resource Facility 2016.02.25 Board-7 of 10Lister 5 • East Campus Village 9\nEAST CAMPUS VILLAGE 9 - SECTOR PLAN 8\nSECTOR CHARACTERISTICS \nThe Sector boundary is formed by 87 Avenue (south), 110 \nStreet (east), Saskatchewan Drive (north), and 111 Street \n(west).  It is characterized by a ‘grid’ circulation pattern, and \n87 Avenue is a key vehicular and pedestrian artery into the \nUniversity campus, extending from 109 Street (east) to Groat \nRoad (west).  111 Street provides a transition between Sector 8 \nand the Academic area of Sector 7.  Saskatchewan Drive is an \nimportant corridor within the campus, offering formal access, \npromenade and views in the river valley.  110 Street is a one-\nway local road that provides a transition between East Campus \nVillage and the Garneau Neighbourhood. \nSector 8 is located in the northeast section of the North \nCampus and is the eastern gateway into the North Campus \nAcademic area.  It is currently characterized by tree lined \nboulevards, and two-story architecture built in the early 1900s, \nand its proximity to the North Saskatchewan River Valley and \nthe Garneau neighbourhood.  It contains International House, \nAspen House and Maple House (the walk-ups), the four new \nGraduate Student Residences and Emily Murphy House, a \nProvincial Historic Resource, and redeveloped 88 Avenue \nCommons, Alder House and Linden House, Peter Lougheed \nHall is currently under construction.\nThe pedestrian network is based on the original ‘grid’ \npattern of lanes and roads, with the 88 Avenue Commons \ncurrently providing an inciting open space, with a dedicated \na pedestrian/bicycle-only route that allows for occasional \nservice access.  89 Avenue will also be reconfigured as a \npedestrian/bicycle only route that allows for occasional service \naccess.\nFigure 2.2 - Districts - Existing Inventory\nN O R T H  S A S K A T C H E W A N  R I V E R  V A L L E Y\nH\nL E\nB R\n8 7  A V E .\n1\n1\n0\n S\nT\n.\n9 0  A V E .\n8 8  A V\n8 9  A V\n1\n1\n1\n S\nT\n.\nS A S K A T C H E W A N  D R .\nInternational\nHouse\n50 44\n23 19 39 29 7 3\n34 32 6 4\n45 29 9 5\n19 15 11 9\n244654\nAdair\nPark\nEco-\nHouse\nMixed\nUse\nResidential/\nAcademic\nSupport\n(Leadership\nCollege)\nFuture\nResidential\nFuture\nResidential\nFuture\nResidential\nBlk 2 \nBlk 4\nECV 1 ECV 2\nECV 3\nECV 4\none way\non\ne \nw\nay\nGarden\none way\nN\nNTS\nPlan boundary\nExisting building\nRelocated building\nVehicle roadways\nPedestrian entry points\nPedestrian/bicycle routes\nGreenway corridor\nCrosswalk\nService corridors\nContra-fl ow bike lane\nMinor node\nEmily Murphy House\nHistoric resource\nConnect to nearby landmarks\nOpen Space\nU of A Sector 8, Long Range \nDevelopment Plan March 2013\nSECTOR VISION \nSector 8 will be developed as a vibrant and integrated student-residential \nneighbourhood, while meeting the student residence needs of the University (1,500 \nbeds) and respecting the character of the neighbourhood.  In order to meet this \nvision, Sector 8 will include:\n• increased student residences at sufficient densities;\n• minimized vehicular access to and within area;\n• preservation and enhancement of street/avenue grid network;\n• affordable housing in terms of capital, operating, maintenance, and student retail; \nand\n• integration and connectivity between Sectors 7 and 8.\nThese elements will support place-making in a campus context.  The University will \ncelebrate the area’s social history and ensure that new development is sensitive to \nEast Campus Village’s aesthetic character, and maintains the existing grid system \nand mature landscaping along corridors.\nECV 9ECV 9\nPreliminary Design Report\nOPEN HOUSE #1  -  BOARD 8\nResearch & Collections Resource Facility 2016.02.25 Board-8 of 10Lister 5 • East Campus Village 9\nEAST CAMPUS VILLAGE 9 - SITE PLAN OPTIONS\nOPTION 1 OPTION 2 OPTION 3\nDESIGN PRINCIPLES FOR GARNEAU INFILL \nExcerpts from U of A Sector 8 Long Range Development Plan, March 2013\nThe design principles for Sector 8 relate to the neighbourhood, the site within the \nneighbourhood, and the proposed development on any site within the neighbourhood.  \nThe design principles relating to the neighbourhood include:\n• Maintaining the scale and general character of the existing neighbourhood and \ncompatibility with the neighbouring community of Garneau, whose scale and \ngeneral character is described in the Garneau Area Redevelopment Plan.\n• Encouraging residents of the student housing to access required services in the \nsurrounding neighbourhood community.\n• Planning and developing Sector 8 with adjacent Sector 7.\nThe design principles relating to any proposed development include:\n• Producing a high quality living environment for all residents.\n• Designing housing for flexibility and adaptation.\n• Incorporating into the design a variety of facilities including community use spaces.\n• Determining building heights and setbacks using neighbourhood specific design \nguidelines references.\nTHE UNIVERSITY’S GOALS\nExcerpts from U of A Sector 8 Long Range Development Plan, March 2013 \nThe University’s goals in the development of Sector 8 include:\n1)  At every stage in planning and development, achieve a balance of the needs of the \nUniversity with the character and scale of the neighbourhood.  This includes:\na)  Achieving a residential density on site that integrates, enhances and doesn’t \ncontradict the essential historical and residential scale of the site by developing \nsolutions for the reasonable “carrying capacity” of student accommodation on the \nsite, not its maximum density potential.  In other words, determine what number of \nstudents the site will accommodate while staying within the parameters described \nin this document.\nb)  Facilitating growth of the University by increasing student housing availability on \nthe North Campus.\nc)  Minimizing vehicular access to and use within the site.  The TDM (Travel Demand \nManagement) plan is recommended to be implemented over the entire campus.\nd)  Preserving the street and avenue grids in the neighbourhood and across the \nSector 8 site.\n2)  Develop housing that sets a standard for residential design in Canada’s University \ncommunities.  This includes:\na)  Developing open space that will support a sense of community, by providing many \ntypes and sizes of outdoor meeting and recreation area.  In addition, open space \nshould be designed and maintained to unify the campus by connecting diverse site \nand building elements together as an attractive whole.\nb)  Bringing together a diverse group of people by providing settings that foster \nlearning, creativity, collegiality and intellectual growth.\nc)  Promoting interaction.  That extends beyond the development of appropriate \nresidences, courtyards or quads, to the purposeful creation of many different \ntypes of spaces strategically planned, placed and furnished to encourage informal \ndialogue in student-to teacher, student-to-student, Garneau community-to-\nstudent, and community-to-community situations.\nd)  Ensure that housing costs will be affordable in terms of capital, operating, \nmaintenance and student rental costs.\nPROS\n• Consistent with design guidelines\n• Open courtyard create community \nspace shared with adjacent building\n• Multiple exposures, morning, noon, \nand night\n• One connected main floor\n• Massing feels lighter\n• Tiered building to scale of adjacent \nbuilding\n• This breaks up the west facade from \n111 Street\nCONS\n• Pedestrian access direct through the \nmain floor from the pedestrian path\n• Multiple courtyards could limit the \nsize, type, or scope of the activities\nPROS\n• Consistent with design guidelines\n• Split of main floor can create distinct \nspaces adjacent to pedestrian path\n• The open courtyard is inclusive \nfor the adjacent buildings and the \npedestrian path\n• Building face the streets\n• Tiered building to scale of adjacent \nbuildings\nCONS\n• Functionality and operation of the \nmain floor area is split and could \nrequire more than one entrance and \nstaffing\n• East facing courtyard would only have \ndirect sun in the morning hours\nPROS\n• Consistent with design guidelines\n• Creates courtyard for building \ncommunity\n• The juxtaposition of the upper floor \nlevels can help break up the facade to \nthe street\n• Overall building height would be \nlower\nCONS\n• Functionality and operations of the \nmain floor area is split and could \nrequire more than one entrance and \nstaffing\n• More site is used for the building as \nopposed to landscaped areas\n• The east facade faces onto the \nadjacent buildings to the east\n111 Street\n90 \nAve\nnue\n111 Street\n90 \nAve\nnue\n111 Street\n90 \nAve\nnue\nECV 9ECV 9\nPreliminary Design Report\nOPEN HOUSE #1  -  BOARD 9\nResearch & Collections Resource Facility 2016.02.25 Board-9 of 10Lister 5 • East Campus Village 9\nEAST CAMPUS VILLAGE 9\nARCHITECTURAL CONCEPT\nThe architectural guiding principles:\n• Engaging the identity of a place\n• Interpreting the context\n• Creating a third place:  activate community building\n• Transcending the present: traditional and modern\n• Landscaping to enhance character of development and in \nsupport of Winter City Strategy and Guidelines\nProject Goals\n• Increase purpose built student residences to accommodate \nup to 25% of full-time students at the University of Alberta\n• Support student recruitment, retention and achievement\n• Enhance community building, student life and campus \nexperience\n• Smart growth campus development that supports a safe, \nsustainable and healthy community\n• Integrate planned neighbourhood with amenities in \nGarneau\nProject Deliverables:\n• Create an on-campus residence and community with \napproximately 300 additional beds\n• Improve quality and increase the number of 4 bedroom and \n6 bedroom suites in response to demand\n• Functional and attractive suite and floor layout with natural \nlight\n• Interior and outdoor social spaces to support a residence \nlife program\nProject Site\n• On 89th Avenue, walkable to transit station and amenities \non 109 Street\n• In East Campus Village that currently includes International \nHouse, Alder House, Linden House, Upper years’ Aspen and \nMaple walk-up apartments, Graduate Student Residences \nand detached houses.\nChallenges:\n• Balancing functionality, student life, capital cost, quality, \noperations/maintenance cost and curb appeal\n• Aggressive project delivery schedule for occupancy\n• Balancing new development with preserving character of \nneighbourhood\n• Infill development per design guideline, preservation plan \nand Long Range Development Plan\n• Support site operational requirements, create new outdoor \nsocial spaces without increasing parking\nOpportunities\n• Sustainable design targeting Green Globe standards\n• Continue to develop East Campus Village into a vibrant, \nstudent-focused neighbourhood walkable to campus and \namenities\n• Provide student-friendly interior design, welcoming \nentrances, social spaces and enhanced landscaping \nconnecting to Commons and bicycle paths\n• Provide large, accessible spaces\nThe East Campus Village 9 Development shall consist of a \napproximate 304-bed residence.
