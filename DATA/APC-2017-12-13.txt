During the discussion, members sought clarification in regards to funding sources, enrolment and the dual-credit initiative to encourage high school students to enroll in this program. A member pointed out that they were unable to support this proposal citing the lack of specific reference to Indigenous culture within the programming.",

            "Description": "Purpose of the Proposal: To discuss the proposed change to add “International” to the terms of reference for the GFC Academic Planning Committee. Discussion: The Chair noted that one of the recommendations of the ad hoc Committee on Academic Governance including Delegated Authority was to add the area of ‘International’ to APC’s terms of reference. He provided an overview of current activities including international academic programs such as dual degrees and shared credentials, and international tuition and fees which are considered by APC. He also noted that there is a President’s Committee on International Strategy and Provost’s Committee on International Initiatives. He then invited members to discuss how this area could be added to APC’s terms of reference. Ms Haggarty-France clarified that the ad hoc Committee had envisioned that APC could play a role in strategic decision-making based on international priorities. The addition of research to APC’s terms of reference is additional justification for including international in the committee’s mandate. Members discussed the scope of the committee’s reach in regards to international initiatives. It was suggested that the findings of the Unit Review for University of Alberta International (UAI) could be helpful in this discussion. Questions were raised about UAI’s involvement in academic programming, and the approval mechanism of MOU’s with other institutions. A member suggested that the terms of reference could be general in regards to the purview over international initiatives such as the review of major international activities, policies and initiatives. A member suggested that APC’s terms of reference could include Indigenous initiatives, noting that the area is not covered within other governance bodies and also applies to programming and research at the university. Members discussed the role of GFC in reviewing international initiatives and it was noted that APC could produce an annual report in regards to international initiatives. The Chair thanked members for their discussion and noted that the item would be brought back for further deliberation.",

Attachment 1 (page(s) 1 – Centre collégial de l’Alberta Proposed New Éducation à la petite enfance—\nNiveau II Certificate Program) \nPrepared by: Kate Peters, Portfolio Initiatives Manager, peters3@ualberta.ca \nNew Program Proposal – System Coordination Review 1 \nDiploma/Certificate Programs  \nProposal Template \nDiploma, Certificate and Non-credential Programs \nThe following template outlines the information required by Innovation and Advanced Education to \nsupport its comprehensive review of proposals for new certificate, diploma and non-credential \nprograms and new specializations in existing certificate, diploma and non-credential programs. \nThe guiding premise of the review is to ensure that the program adds value to Campus Alberta. The \nreview will focus on the institution’s assessment of student and employer demand; the situation of the \nprogram in the context of Campus Alberta; the financial viability of the program, including \nimplications for students and taxpayers; and dimensions of program quality.  \nSECTION 1: PROGRAM OVERVIEW \n1.1 Program Name(name to be used in Calendar and on parchment) \nCertificate program :  \nÉducation à la petite enfance -- Niveau II \n1.2 Institution(s) \nCentre collégial de l’Alberta, Campus St-Jean, University of Alberta \n1.3 Contact Person \nName: Dolorèse Nolette  \nTelephone:  (780)485-8648 \nEmail: dnolette@ualberta.ca   \n1.4 Type of Initiative \nThis is a new French-language Éducation à la petite enfance – Niveau II certificate program to be \noffered through the Centre collegial de l’Alberta (CCA). \n1.5 Program Length \nDefine the length of the proposed program using measures appropriate to the schedule and delivery format. \nThis will include total course credits and weeks, and, where relevant, hours and semesters of instruction. \nThe proposed program will take place over a minimum of 38 weeks, if studying full-time. A total of ten \ncourses and two practica must be completed.  A course leading to the Child Development Assistant \n(Level 1) accreditation is included in the program should the student not have this level of training \nprior to entering the program. The program will include a blend of on-site, face-to-face and online \nlearning opportunities.  \nNew Program Proposal – System Coordination and Quality Review 2 \nDiploma/Certificate Programs  \n1.6 Program Description \nProvide a brief (1-2 paragraphs) description of the program, summarizing its intended purpose, curriculum \ndesign, and methods of delivery and highlighting distinctive attributes. Attach as an Appendix a complete list of \ncourses, including credit values, instructional hours and brief (calendar style) course descriptions. For elective \noptions, specify course selection parameters. Identify new courses to be developed for this program.  \nThe Éducation à la petite enfance--Niveau II leads to a certificate. The program is designed to ladder \ninto the proposed Éducation à la petite enfance – Superviseur diploma, by taking a second year of \nprogramming. The certificate is a fast track to the workforce and provides students with the \nopportunity to develop skills through courses and practica which integrate academics and practical \nexperiences. The Éducation à la petite enfance--Niveau II certificate program prepares graduates to \nprovide quality childcare, from infants to school age, in a wide variety of settings and to plan \ndevelopmentally appropriate activities for the children in their care. The certificate is unique in its \nperspective of first language and second language development in a minority language and or \nbilingual setting. Courses and student learning experiences will prepare graduates to enrich early \nlearning experiences with Francophone cultural elements. Graduates will be particularly well suited to \naccess employment in Francophone/French-language child care settings since the program prepares \nthem to understand and plan programming to meet linguistic needs in a culturally diverse setting.  \nThis program may be completed on a part-time or full-time basis. Courses will be offered in a hybrid \nmanner, which will include face-to-face learning opportunities and online work as well as on-site \ntraining/practica. Some courses will be offered evenings and weekends in order to meet the needs of \nstudents. Each semester includes coursework and a practicum where students will apply their \nknowledge working with children in a variety of French-language child care settings. \nOnce they have successfully completed the program, graduates can apply for certification as Child \nDevelopment Workers as set out as Alberta’s Child Care Staff Qualifications.   \nSee Appendix I for course list and course descriptions. \n1.7 Proposed Implementation Date \n  September 2018 \n1.8 Enrolment Plan \nInclude assumptions and explanatory notes (e.g., attrition, part-time enrolment). Also: \n● If program implementation will occur over a number of years, provide data for each year to full \nimplementation. \n● This program targets French-speaking Albertans. \n● It is expected that many students registering in Éducation à la petite enfance--Niveau \nII certificate program will be part-time students and individuals already working in childcare \nsettings. They will progress through the program as the courses are offered and their \nschedules allow. Students will have 5 years after their admission into the program to \nNew Program Proposal – System Coordination and Quality Review 3 \nDiploma/Certificate Programs  \ncomplete it.  \n● High School graduates are also expected to apply.  \nIf internal reallocation of existing resources is proposed, describe any anticipated decrease in enrolment in \nother programs that would result.  \nProposed Enrolment Year 1 Year 2 Year 3 Year 4 Year 5 Annual Ongoing \nTotal head count 0 0 0 0 0 0 \n● Part-Time Level II 10 10 10 10 10 10 \n●  Full-Time Level II 10 10 10 10 10 10 \nTotal FLE 0 0 0 0 0 0 \n● FLE Year 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 \nAnticipated No. of Graduates 8 12 12 12 12 12 \nLow attrition is expected due to the niche this program will fill. Students looking for face-to-face \nflexible French-language program delivery and to develop the unique skills required for first and \nsecond-language development in a minority-language setting will now have the choice of Centre \ncollegial de l’Alberta. In addition, the CCA offers a very personalized approach to instruction and \nprogram management which favours retention of students.  \nSECTION 2: DEMAND \n2.1 Student Demand Analysis \nAnalysis should be supported by relevant data for the region and for Campus Alberta, as might be derived \nfrom: systematic questionnaire surveys of target audiences; application and enrolment summaries and trends \nfor similar programs currently offered by other institutions; tabulations of unsolicited student inquiries and/or \nexpressions of interest obtained at student recruitment events; demographic projections for relevant sub-\npopulations.  \nGiven Centre collégial de l’Alberta’s provincial mandate, the needs of the Francophone community \nas well as those of the general public throughout Alberta have been considered.  \nIn March 2016, Centre collégial de l’Alberta undertook an online survey among Francophone school \nstudents in grades 10 to 12. We also sent the same survey to Francophone day care centers to \nexplore the possibility of workers wanting to go back to school or further their training. A total of 100 \npeople filled out the survey, 97% of the responses were from grade 10 to 12 students from Calgary \n(33%), Edmonton (26%) and North-Western Alberta (25%).  \nWhen we asked the question: Which programs interest you the most? A total of 59% chose \nÉducation à la petite enfance (Early Learning and Child Care), either the certificate (27%) or the \ndiploma (32%).  \nNew Program Proposal – System Coordination and Quality Review 4 \nDiploma/Certificate Programs  \n**Title: Which course interests you the most? (choose among the following). The choices listed are: \nEducational Assistant/Certificate, Early Childhood/Certificate, Early Childhood/Diploma, Educational \nAssistant-Special Education/Diploma.  \nStudents from grade 10 to 12 say they would choose the program which most interests them \nregardless of the length of the program, where it is offered, or the institution that provides it.  \nNew Program Proposal – System Coordination and Quality Review 5 \nDiploma/Certificate Programs  \n**Title: What is the most important thing to you when you choose a program? (Choose all answers) The \nlist of options includes: Where the program is offered, which institution offers the program, the \nprogram itself, whether courses are offered in class or online, the length of the program.  \n83% of the potential students answered that they would rather take a course given in a face-to-face \ndelivery model than online.  \nThis information has been used to determine where online and face-to-face delivery are appropriate \nto the needs of the target audience. \nNew Program Proposal – System Coordination and Quality Review 6 \nDiploma/Certificate Programs  \n**Title: What do you prefer? The choices list: online learning and in class learning.  \nPrevious survey results also show strong interest in French language programming. In 2011, Centre \ncollégial de l’Alberta initiated a survey in order to assess student interest in undertaking \npostsecondary college-level studies in French. Both an electronic survey instrument and a hard copy \nversion were distributed to the Francophone and French Immersion schools in Alberta.  \nA total of 493 responses were received, of which approximately 45% were from Edmonton, 18% from \nCalgary, with the remaining 37% of respondents from rural and northern Alberta. The breakdown of \nrespondents from Francophone schools and French Immersion schools showed participation was \nalmost equal, as was the distribution of respondents across grades 10 (37%), 11(30%), and \n12(33%). \nSchool # of Respondents % of Respondents  \nFrancophone 259 53 \nFrench \nImmersion \n234 47 \nTotal 493 100 \nGrade # of Respondents % of Respondents \nGrade 10 184 37 \nGrade 11 148 30 \nGrade 12 161 33 \nNew Program Proposal – System Coordination and Quality Review 7 \nDiploma/Certificate Programs  \nTotal 493 100 \nAmong the 493 survey respondents, 28% indicated without stipulation that they were interested in \npursuing postsecondary studies in French and an additional 56% indicated that they would be \ninterested in doing so subject to the availability of programs of interest to them, for a total of 84% of \nrespondents interested in studying in French.   \n**Title: How interested are you in pursuing post-secondary studies in French? The choices provided \nare: very interested, depending on available programs, not interested.  \n2.2 Labour Market Analysis \nAnalysis should be supported by relevant data and placed in the context of the target occupational/regional \nlabour market(s). Relevant data sources include systematic surveys of prospective employers; occupational \nsupply/demand projections from government or industry sources; tabulations of job postings/‘help wanted’ \nadvertising; surveys of recruitment and graduate employment rates of similar programs; and demographic \nprojections (i.e. for relevant regions and sub-populations.) Describe anticipated employment outcomes. \nIn the spring of 2016, the Fédération des parents francophones de l’Alberta (FPFA), a Francophone \ncommunity organization providing services to all French-language Alberta early childhood service \nproviders, released the results of a study regarding the child care spaces available versus those \nneeded in Francophone day care settings. Their results are based on a Statistics Canada study and \nshow that there is demand for about 1,180 places in francophone daycares in the province and that \nonly 543 places were actually available. This analysis demonstrates a shortfall of about 630 spaces \nto meet the actual demand. As more spaces are developed to meet this need, the need for qualified \nChild Development Workers able to work with children in a French-speaking and culturally inclusive \nenvironment will also increase.  \nTheir study asked existing daycares about the number of names that were on the waiting list with \nresults indicating that 120 children/families were waiting for a place in Francophone daycare. The \nlong waiting lists further validate the fact that more Francophone daycare centers are needed. Table \n1(Tableau 1) illustrates the specifics.  \nNew Program Proposal – System Coordination and Quality Review 8 \nDiploma/Certificate Programs  \nFédération des parents francophones, Augmenter le nombre de place garderie francophone en Alberta, Défis, \nréalité et recommandations, 2016, p.3 \n** This Table names all French speaking day care service providers who work within institutions (often \nannexed to Francophone schools) and those who provide French-language dayhome services. It \nprovides information on accreditation, the total number of children registered and the scope of the \nwaiting list.  \nIn the same study, one survey was distributed to child care facilities (Graphique 1), the second to \nfamily day homes (Graphique 2), the FPFA asked the administration to identify the types of supports \nor resources that could help them to perform better. \nAfter analyzing and comparing the results of these two graphs, the most pressing needs identified in \nthe two types of settings are professional development (100% and 85%), the discovery of new \npractices (100% and 100%) and the creation of a network of educators (100% and 72%).  \nNew Program Proposal – System Coordination and Quality Review 9 \nDiploma/Certificate Programs  \nFédération des parents francophones, Augmenter le nombre de place garderie francophone en Alberta, Défis, réalité et \nrecommandations, 2016, p.8**This graph shows how each support is ranked from “Very important” to “Not \nimportant” by those who responded to the survey.  \nFédération des parents francophones, Augmenter le nombre de place garderie francophone en Alberta, Défis, réalité et \nrecommandations, 2016, p.9**This graph shows how each support is ranked from “Very important” to “Not \nimportant” by those who responded to the survey.  \nNew Program Proposal – System Coordination and Quality Review 10 \nDiploma/Certificate Programs  \nThe overall conclusion of the FPFA’s study is that there is a glaring shortage of places in French \nlanguage daycare centers all over Alberta but particularly in Calgary and Edmonton. Current \navailability fills only 46% of the demand. Given these results, the FPFA will continue to lobby for an \nincrease in Francophone childcare spaces in Alberta. The FPFA also continues to provide ongoing \nadministrative and mentoring supports to parents and communities throughout Alberta who want to \nestablish French language services. As more centers are opened to provide more spaces, more \nemployment will be created increasing the demand for qualified personnel, trained to work within the \nspecific French language context in Alberta. The CCA has strong ties with the FPFA, its member \nassociations and all Francophone school authorities within the province.   \nThe Centre collégial de l’Alberta’s survey of Francophone community organizations and early \nchildhood education service providers show the need for workers. Response rates for Francophone \nschools was 40%, for day care centers at 40%, for Francophone School Authorities at 13% and for \nprivate day cares at 7%. All of the respondents agree that the need for workers in this field continues \nto increase. Most of them (60%) say that there is actually a greater demand than in previous years.  \n**Title: In light of your experience in the field and in your professional opinion, how would you rate the \ndemand for child development workers? The choices list: less than, equal to or greater that previous \nyears. \nAt the time the survey was taken, six institutional and private day care centers indicated that they \nusually hire one or two employees per year whereas seven indicated that they usually hire five to ten. \nWhen we asked the question: «How many early childhood educators do you plan to hire over the \nnext five years?» the results indicate that employers expect to need a greater number over the \ncoming years. The graph below depicts this  anticipated need. Each letter represents an employer. \nNew Program Proposal – System Coordination and Quality Review 11 \nDiploma/Certificate Programs  \nThe dark blue represents the number of educators employed at the time of polling, the light blue \nrepresents the number of educators they plan to hire over the next five years.  \nAgain, the case can be made that the demand for qualified personnel, trained within the context of \nFrench language specificity, will continue to increase.  \n2.3 Support \nProvide evidence of consultation with and approval/support from relevant professional organizations, \nregulatory bodies, advisory committees, employers, and/or industry. \nThe proposal benefits from strong support from internal and external stakeholders.  \nIn February 2016, a group of professionals and community organization representatives were \nconsulted to discuss the planning of the Centre collégial de l’Alberta for future years. During this \nconsultation, the committee was clear regarding the significance and the necessity of developing a \nprogram in Early learning & Child Care in French offered by the CCA.  \nBoth the Centre collégial de l’Alberta’s Executive Committee and Community Consultative \nCommittee discussed the importance of seeking approval to offer this program over the same period. \nThe membership of both groups is provided in Appendix II. \nIn March 2016, the CCA received letters of support found in Appendix III.  \n2.4 Clinical or Work Experience \nIf clinical or work experience is an essential part of program delivery: \n2.4.1 Provide evidence that the placements will be available when needed. \nThe Centre collégial de l’Alberta is presently working in collaboration with Accès-emploi, a \nFrancophone work and career placement organization, in order to provide work experience to \nstudents.  This collaboration will be helpful in finding work placements, as will working with the \nNew Program Proposal – System Coordination and Quality Review 12 \nDiploma/Certificate Programs  \nFédération des parents francophone de l’Alberta (FPFA), the network of Francophone schools in \nAlberta, and the two Albertan Francophone Parent Link Centres (Edmonton and Calgary). At this \ntime, there are 13 daycare centers affiliated with Francophone schools who are working with the \nFPFA. As more Francophone schools are opened in Alberta, other centers will be created.  Another \nstrong ally in identifying work experience placements in a French speaking child care and \ndevelopment setting is the network of 13 regional offices of the Association canadienne-française de \nl’Alberta (ACFA) spread province-wide. They are in a position to liaise with us to identify private day \ncares. All these stakeholders support or provide some form of early learning or child care and/or \ndevelopment service in a French speaking culturally sensitive and inclusive setting \nPerhaps most importantly, since we estimate that many of the students completing this program will \nalready be in the work force, working in the Early Learning and Child Development field, we foresee \nthat they will be able to complete some of the practicum hours in their workplaces.  \n2.4.2 Describe the student’s role in securing placements. \nCollaboration with Accès-Emploi and other organizations will help students with work experience \nplacements and help them find employment once they obtain their certificate. Students will be \nsupported in finding placements. A guidebook, Guide pour les stages du programme Éducation à \nla petite enfance, for students will outline their responsibilities with regards to the work experience \ncomponent of the program. These responsibilities include: \n- Completing course work of the program \n- Abiding by the University of Alberta Student Code of Conduct and conducting \nthemselves in an ethical and professional manner throughout the job search, interview and within \ntheir position. The University of Alberta Practicum Intervention Policy \n(http://www.governance.ualberta.ca/StudentAppeals/PracticumInterventionPolicy.aspx) will apply \nshould the need arise.  \n- Abiding by the employment standards indicated by the employer and respecting all \npolicies, rules, procedures and conditions set out for the position. \n2.4.3 Explain how the institution will supervise/monitor the learning experience of students in off-site settings? \nA CCA representative will act as primary supervisor for each student placement site. The CCA \nDirector will be responsible for the supervisor who will monitor student progress and provide \nguidance and advice, when necessary. The supervisor will act as the liaison between the Employer, \nthe Student and the CCA. Their responsibilities will also be described in a guidebook, Guide pour \nles employeurs et les superviseurs du programme de l’éducation à la petite enfance. These \nwill include : \n- Creating a provincial database of employers and potential employers in the area of \nÉducation à la petite enfance. \n- Facilitating communication between students, employers and the CCA staff as \ndeemed necessary. \n- Working with students and employers to identify learning opportunities within the \ncontext of job placements and establishing student-based reporting criteria on these specific \nlearning opportunities.  \n- Informing students and employers about policies and procedures as deemed \nnecessary. This will include the Student Code of Conduct and the Practicum Intervention Policy.  \nhttp://www.governance.ualberta.ca/StudentAppeals/PracticumInterventionPolicy.aspx\nNew Program Proposal – System Coordination and Quality Review 13 \nDiploma/Certificate Programs  \n2.4.4 Identify potential employer/employee liability related to this aspect of the program, and how the institution \nintends to manage this liability. \nGiven that the Employer will take on a key role within the program, the CCA will ensure they \nunderstand their responsibilities towards the student by providing a guidebook and workshops. \nThese responsibilities include supervision of the student so as to ensure that the best learning \nopportunities are provided.  \nThe employer will have full oversight on the remuneration of the student (if applicable) and will be \nresponsible for maintaining Comprehensive General Liability coverage appropriate to their \noperations. Employers should also have Workers’ Compensation where applicable.  \nSECTION 3: INSTITUTIONAL AND SYSTEM CONTEXT \n3.1 Institutional Strategy \nHow does the proposed program align with the institution’s strategic priorities and the Comprehensive \nInstitutional Plan? \nThe Éducation à la petite enfance--Niveau II certificate program meets with the University of Alberta’s \nbroadened mandate. One goal of the University of Alberta, as reflected in its strategic plan, For the \nPublic Good, is to connect with its communities, notably embracing and extending strengths such as \nla Francophonie at Campus Saint-Jean, in order to enhance the University’s interconnectedness with \nlocal communities. By drawing students from various Francophone communities, as well as from the \ngeneral public, and preparing graduates to return to work environments in this milieu, the Éducation à \nla petite enfance --Niveau II certificate program enhances this connectedness between the University \nof Alberta, Alberta and Western Canada’s Francophonie and the growing interest for bilingualism (as \nmanifested by enrollments in immersion programs) in the general population. This program will \nenhance the University of Alberta’s reputation as a leader in French language postsecondary \neducation west of Winnipeg.  \nThe University of Alberta is currently the sole post-secondary institution in Alberta which has \nthe mandate to offer French-language college-level programs.  \n3.2 Institutional Programs \nExplain how the proposed program fits with existing programs at the institution, and the anticipated positive or \nnegative impacts on other programs. \nNo negative impact is anticipated. There are currently no college-level Early Learning and Child \nDevelopment certificate or diploma programs offered at the University of Alberta.  \n3.3 Internal Review and Approval \nProvide a brief description of the internal review and approval process followed in developing the proposal. \nNew Program Proposal – System Coordination and Quality Review 14 \nDiploma/Certificate Programs  \nUniversity of Alberta (U of A) internal review and approval to be done by : \n● Centre collégial de l’Alberta, Program Planning Committee (recommendation): April 18, 2017 \n● Centre collégial de l’Alberta Executive Committee (approval) : May 18, 2017 \n● Faculté Saint-Jean Faculty Council (for information only), date : October 6, 2017 \n● U of A General Faculties Council Academic Planning Committee (approval), date: December \n13,  2017 \n3.4 Campus Alberta Programs/Initiatives \nDiscuss the relationships (similarity, complementarity, transfer, competition) of the proposed program to other \nprograms or initiatives in Campus Alberta and explain what the proposed program would add to the system. If \nthe proposed program would duplicate existing programs, explain why that duplication is warranted.  \nThe Éducation à la petite enfance – Niveau II program offered by CCA will be unique in various \nways. The most obvious differentiator is language, as the program will be offered in French within the \ncontext of a French language institution, Campus Saint-Jean. The perspective of first language \ndevelopment in a minority language and or bilingual setting, in addition to ways by which to enrich \nearly learning experiences with cultural elements, will be fully explored within the curriculum and be \npart of the student’s learning experience.  \nGraduates of the program will be able to work in either of Canada’s official languages. However, they \nwill be particularly well suited for the French language environment. Courses will be offered in a \nhybrid manner, which will include face-to-face teaching and learning, online learning as well as on \nthe job training. Some courses will be offered evenings and weekends in order to meet the needs of \nstudents. Face-to-face courses will be offered in Grande Prairie, Calgary and Edmonton, where \ndeemed appropriate.  \nThe CCA has been involved in a three year partnership with Lakeland College by providing funds \nthrough the Official Languages in Education Program (Federal funding) for their online development \nand offering of this program in French since 2014. This agreement was struck in an effort to meet the \nurgent need for bilingual, qualified Child Development Workers and Supervisors in the French-\nspeaking community while CCA was undergoing its implementation phase. Now, CCA seeks \naccreditation so that it can offer a hybrid version of this diploma program in geographic areas such as \nEdmonton, Grande Prairie and Calgary. The CCA’s Éducation à la petite enfance – Niveau II will \ncomplement the existing program at Lakeland by offering a face-to-face option in a Francophone \ninstitution. In addition, the curriculum will be adapted to the needs of Francophone and French-\nSpeaking families living in a minority context.  \nNew Program Proposal – System Coordination and Quality Review 15 \nDiploma/Certificate Programs  \n3.5 Consultation \nSummarize the type and outcomes of consultations with other institutions offering related programs. Attach \ncopies of relevant documents (e.g. letters, meeting summaries). Discuss the potential for inter-institutional \ncollaboration.  \nThere have been ongoing discussions between CSJ/CCA representatives and Lakeland College \nrepresentatives over the past 18 months. These discussions were held in order to draw up a new \nagreement to continue the collaboration. Lakeland College representatives have indicated that they \nwill continue offering the program in years to come with or without CCA/UofA support.  CCA \nExecutive Committee members have decided that CCA must pursue offering the program \nindependently given the need expressed by the Francophone community and supported by the \nlabour market analysis. CCA is strategically positioned to liaise with community members throughout \nthe province to offer a program anchored in language development in a minority context and a \nculturally rich learning experience.s \n3.6 Learner Pathways \n3.6.1 Identify potential pathways from work to school (where applicable). \nThe proposed Éducation à la petite enfance -- Niveau II  program will be open to students coming \ndirectly from high school as well as to other applicants looking to diversify their career opportunities \nor reorient their career. Should they already be employed in the Early Learning and Child Care field, \nthey may use their workplace for their practicum.  \nA dual-credit initiative will be implemented in collaboration with the Centre francophone d’éducation à \ndistance to encourage high school students to consider taking this program. Courses from the \nAlberta High School curriculum which could be adapted to this certificate program include: \n● HSS2020 Nurturing Children (Encadrement des enfants) \n● HSS2030 Perspectives on Interpersonal Relationships (Perspectives en \nrelations interpersonnelles) \n● HSS2040 Family Foundations (Fondements de la famille) \nDiscussions are ongoing to establish an MOA to this effect.  \n3.6.2 Identify potential opportunities for transfer/laddering into the proposed program from other institutions \nor other programs within the institution; and for transfer/laddering from the proposed program to other \nprograms within the institution or at other institutions. List any formal agreements for internal or inter-\ninstitutional transfer/laddering that have been negotiated to this point. \nThe Education à la petite enfance--Niveau II certificate program will ladder directly into the proposed \nÉducation à la petite enfance – Superviseur diploma program.  The Éducation à la petite enfance – \nNiveau II program will contain the course needed to obtain the Early Learning and Child Care (Child \nDevelopment Assistant) designation, for those students who do not yet have this qualification. If \nstudents already hold the Early Learning and Child Care (Child Development Assistant) certification,  \nthree credits will be applied towards their Éducation à la petite enfance—Niveau II program.  \nNew Program Proposal – System Coordination and Quality Review 16 \nDiploma/Certificate Programs  \n3.6.3 Estimate the portion of graduates who can be expected to proceed to further education directly. At a later \nstage in their careers. What types of programs/credentials would they be most likely to pursue?  \nWe estimate that several certificate program graduates will proceed to the diploma level but few \ngraduates will proceed to further education directly after completing their Diploma program. At a later \ndate, however, some may wish to continue their education in an undergraduate program such as \nCampus Saint-Jean’s Baccalauréat en education. \nSECTION 4: FINANCIAL VIABILITY AND SUSTAINABILITY \n4.1 Annual Budget and Funding Sources \nIdentify annual and one-time expenditures and annual revenue for the program in the budget tables below. If \nprogram implementation will take place over more than one year, provide estimates for each year until full \nimplementation. Provide explanatory notes for all budget assumptions, such as inflation and per student \ntuition. \n(For proposals without significant impacts on institutional costs, revenues or enrolment, a detailed budget presentation \nwill not normally be required (please confirm with the department). Such proposals will satisfy all of the following tests: \n1. The proposal is for a new specialization in an existing program, consisting of an innovative combination of existing \ncurricula. \n2. Overall enrolment capacity in the program is maintained. \n3. Excepting incidental administrative and promotional costs, no start-up or incremental operations costs are incurred.) \n Year 1 Year 2 Year 3 Year 4 Year 5 Annual Ongoing \nRevenue       \nTuition and Related Fees1 $65 544 $65 544 $65 544 $65 544 $65 544 $65 544 \nRe-allocation from Existing \nPrograms $0 $0 $0 $0 $0 $0 \nOther Internal Sources2 $600,000 $600,000 $600,000 $600,000 $600,000 $600,000 \nExternal (Third Party) Sources3 $160 000 $160 000 $160 000 $160 000 $160 000 $160 000 \nGOA (Identify source)4 $ 0  $0  0  $ 0 $ 0  $ 0 \nOther (specify) $0 $0 $0 $0 $0 $0 \nTotal Revenue $850,544 $850,544 $850,544 $850,544 $850,544 $850,544 \nOperational Costs       \nSalaries, Wages and Benefits4 $160 000 $160 000 $160 000 $160 000 $160 000 $160 000 \nMaterials and Contracted \nServices5 $ 10,000 \n$ 10,000 $ 10,000 $ 10,000 $ 10,000 $ 10,000 \nOther Direct Costs6 $80 544 $80 544 $80 544 $80 544 $80 544 $80 544 \nIndirect Costs7 $600,000 $600,000 $600,000 $600,000 $600,000 $600,000 \nTotal Operational Costs $850,544 $850,544 $850,544 $850,544 $850,544 $850,544 \nNotes: \nNew Program Proposal – System Coordination and Quality Review 17 \nDiploma/Certificate Programs  \n1. Tuition and Related fees:  Included here is an estimate of revenue for the number of students expected in the \nprogram on a part-time and on a full time basis.  Projected enrollment is relatively stable and includes part-time \nenrollments which are difficult to predict. Also, there are no increases in the tuition fees that are predicted and it is not \npossible for us to project the increases in non-instructional fees at this time.  This revenue is subtracted in the Direct \nCosts since they are not a revenue that can be accessed by CCA. Therefore, tuition and related fees were projected as a \nstable figure throughout the budget.  \n2. Other Internal Sources:  CCA receives an administration budget envelope which provides funding for CCA basic \noperations.  At this time, two full programs are being offered, one in going through the approval process at GoA, and \ntwo programs are offered through a collaboration agreement.  General operations as well as supports to students and \nstaff are taken into account within a Cost Sharing Agreement established between Faculté Saint-Jean and Centre \ncollegial de l’Alberta.  These include, but are not limited to, general IT supports and maintenance, student support \nservices, rental for spaces used by CCA, general promotion of CCA within CSJ.   This sum is withdrawn in the \nIndirect Costs.   \n3. Identify the source and duration of external funding and outline any terms, conditions, and deliverables associated \nwith the funding. External (Third Party) Sources might include support from other levels of government; e.g., the \nGovernment of Canada. Funding from OLE, Canadian Heritage \n4. Salaries, Wages and Benefits: Teaching Staff: 1 Full-time AST Coordinator and instructor (salary and benefits: \n100K), Part-time instructional staff to offer up to 5 courses (5*8000$=40K), Additional part-time junior tech support \nshared with other programs(10K), Additional % of recruitment coordinator salary (10K) \n5. Contracted Services: A contract will be offered to a placement agency to provide workshops and support to students \nseeking practicum placements. \n6. Other Direct Costs: Direct costs include projected tuition and related fees which stay with the University(65,544$), \nstudent bursaries(10K), program specific promotional efforts and materials(2500$ and 2500$).  \n7. All other costs, associated with providing this program and with providing support to students and staff are taken into \naccount within the Cost Sharing Agreement established between Campus Saint-Jean and Centre collegial de \nl’Alberta. The Cost Sharing Agreement benefits from another source of funding, through the CCA Administration \nbudget envelope granted by Alberta Advanced Education.  \nOne-time expenditures Amount Revenue Source Details \nFacilities $   \nEquipment and IT $ -   The IT infrastructure and teaching platform are already in place.   \nCurriculum Development $100 000 \nOLE Program  Acquisition/adaptation and \ndevelopment of course content for in \nclass and on-line delivery.

Tuition rates for both \nCanadian students and International students are slightly lower than in other institutions offering this \nprogram. Fees are significantly higher than in other institutions.  \n4.2.2 Discuss the financial impact on students and the learner funding system, taking into account the costs of \neducation and the potential debt burden relative to post-graduation earning capacity. \nFunding options by way of student loans for Alberta students and student bursaries provided by CCA \nand various endowment funds will be available to students. Because this is a one year program, the \nfinancial burden is lower than other programs and is in line with post-graduation earning capacity \nand workforce hiring capacity.  \n4.2.3 If program funding includes internal reallocation, evaluate the impact of this reallocation on the \ninstitution’s operations and overall financial position. \nThis is not applicable to this program.  \nSECTION 5: QUALITY ASSESSMENT \n5.1 Institutional Capacity5.1.1 List instructional positions that would support the proposed program, \nspecifying position title, credential and experience requirements, and areas of expertise. Distinguish between \nnew and existing positions; and regular and sessional appointments. Describe mechanisms (existing and \nplanned) to develop and ensure currency of teaching skills and disciplinary expertise. \nThe instructional positions necessary to offer the program will be equivalent to one and a half full-time \npositions for the period of instruction (full-time and/or sessional lecturers). One full-time position will \nbe created (AST-12 month) CCA will seek instructional staff with the best expertise and language \nskills to provide quality instruction and will give preference to instructors with practical experience. \nPart of the instructional duty may be taken on by instructors already working at CSJ.  \nNew Program Proposal – System Coordination and Quality Review 19 \nDiploma/Certificate Programs  \n5.1.2 List instructional support positions (e.g. lab technicians, tutors) related to the proposed program.  \nCSJ technical support and distance learning support staff will work collaboratively with instructional \nstaff and with students to ensure that the e-learning platform (Moodle) meets their needs for the \nonline delivery portion of the program. No new support positions will be developed for this program.  \n5.1.3 Describe facilities, equipment and information resources (existing and planned) that would house and \nsupport delivery of the proposed program. \nAn online learning platform, Moodle, will host courses for distance learning. Classroom space for face-\nto-face delivery in various regions of Alberta will be part of our negotiations with the appropriate \nCampus Alberta partners.  \n5.1.4 Discuss the anticipated impacts of the proposed program on student support services. \nBecause of the fairly low number of expected students, it is anticipated that there will not be a \nsignificant impact on student support services at CSJ which is hosting about 700 students this \nacademic year. Students in the Education à la petite enfance – Niveau II program will participate in \nstudent services to the same degree as CSJ university-level students.  \n5.2 Curriculum  \nDescribe the process of development and validation of curriculum for the proposed program. If available, \nplease attach external review documents. \nCCA will develop the Education à la petite enfance certificate program using both the Normes de \ncertification des services de garde d’enfants de l’Alberta and the implementation of the framework \nJeu, participation et possibilités: Un cadre pédagogique pour les programmes d’apprentissage et de \ngarde des jeunes enfants en Alberta. These tools will provide a basis for guiding students on how to \nuse and adapt these norms to the French language early childhood learning environment.  \nTo supplement these resources, CCA will collaborate with partners at the national level to learn from \nbest practice in early-childhood education in a minority context in Canada. A fundamental part of the \nprogramming will be adapting the offering of services in French in a minority language context, of \ndeveloping language and culture as an integral part of the early learning and childcare experience.  \nFurthermore, the CCA will benefit from the expertise of CSJ’s faculty whose research is in the area of \nchild development and early childhood education as well as stakeholders in the field.

Attachment 1 (page(s) 1 - <>) Centre collégial de l’Alberta Proposed New Éducation à la petite enfance—\nSuperviseur Diploma Program) \nPrepared by: Dolorèse Nolette, Assistant Dean and Director:  CCA, dnolette@ualberta.ca \nProposal Template \nDiploma, Certificate and Non-credential Programs \nThe following template outlines the information required by Innovation and Advanced Education \nto support its comprehensive review of proposals for new certificate, diploma and non-credential \nprograms and new specializations in existing certificate, diploma and non-credential programs. \nThe guiding premise of the review is to ensure that the program adds value to Campus Alberta. \nThe review will focus on the institution’s assessment of student and employer demand; the \nsituation of the program in the context of Campus Alberta; the financial viability of the program, \nincluding implications for students and taxpayers; and dimensions of program quality.  \nSECTION 1: PROGRAM OVERVIEW \n1.1 Program Name \nÉducation à la petite enfance  Superviseur  \nDiploma program :  \n1.2 Institution(s) \nCentre collégial de l’Alberta, Campus St-Jean, University of Alberta \n1.3 Contact Person \nName: Dolorèse Nolette  \nTelephone:  (780)485-8648 \nEmail: dnolette@ualberta.ca   \n1.4 Type of Initiative \nNew Certificate, Diploma or Non-credential program; or new specialization(s) in existing program. \nThis is a new French-language Éducation à la petite enfance--Superviseur  diploma program \nto be offered by the Centre collégial de l’Alberta (CCA).  \n1.5 Program Length \nDefine the length of the proposed program using measures appropriate to the schedule and \ndelivery format. This will include total course credits and weeks, and, where relevant, hours \nand semesters of instruction. \nThe proposed program will take place over a minimum of 32 weeks, if studying full-time. \nBeyond the coursework, the program includes two practica and will be delivered in a blended \nhybrid approach including on-site, face-to-face and online training.  \n1.6 Program Description \nProvide a brief (1-2 paragraphs) description of the program, summarizing its intended purpose, \ncurriculum design, and methods of delivery and highlighting distinctive attributes. Attach as an \nAppendix a complete list of courses, including credit values, instructional hours and brief (calendar \nstyle) course descriptions. For elective options, specify course selection parameters. Identify new \ncourses to be developed for this program.  \nTaken following the completion of the Education à la petite enfance- Niveau II certificate, the \nÉducation à la petite enfance--Superviseur leads to a diploma. While the certificate is a fast \ntrack to the workforce, the diploma opens up more job opportunities and a higher salary. Both \nthe certificate and the diploma programs are unique in their perspective of first language and \nsecond language development in a minority language and/or bilingual setting. Courses and \nstudent learning experiences will prepare graduates to enrich early learning experiences with \nFrancophone cultural elements. Graduates will be particularly well suited to access \nemployment in Francophone/French-language child care settings since the program prepares \nthem to understand and plan programming to meet linguistic needs in a culturally diverse \nsetting.  \nThis program may be completed on a part-time or full-time basis. Courses will be offered in a \nhybrid manner, which will include face-to-face learning opportunities and online work as well \nas on-site training/practicum. Some courses will be offered evenings and weekends in order \nto meet the needs of students. Each semester includes coursework and a practicum where \nstudents will apply their knowledge working with children in a variety of French-language child \ncare settings. \nOnce they have successfully completed the program, graduates can apply for certification as \nChild Development Workers as set out as Alberta’s Child Care Staff Qualifications.   \nSee Appendix I for course list and course descriptions. \n1.7 Proposed Implementation Date \nSeptember 2019 \n1.8 Enrolment Plan \nInclude assumptions and explanatory notes (e.g., attrition, part-time enrolment). Also: \n● If program implementation will occur over a number of years, provide data for each year to \nfull implementation.  \nThe Éducation à la petite enfance--Superviseur diploma program builds upon the certificate \nprogram (Education à la petite enfance - Niveau II), and will appeal to those students wishing \nto advance to positions with more responsibility and authority in Early Learning Child \nDevelopment –specifically trained for the Francophone/French speaking childcare context. \nStudents will most probably register on a part-time basis and will progress through the \nprogram on an ongoing basis until completion. Students will have 5 years after admission to \ncomplete the program.  \n● If internal reallocation of existing resources is proposed, describe any anticipated decrease in \nenrolment in other programs that would result.  \nProposed Enrolment Year 1 Year 2 Year 3 Year 4 Year 5 Annual Ongoing \nTotal head count 0 0 0 0 0 0 \n● Part-Time (Niveau \nIII) 10 10 10 10 10 10 \nFull-Time(Niveau III) 2 2 2 2 2 2 \nTotal FLE 0 0 0 0 0 0 \n● FLE Year 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 \n● FLE Year 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 \nAnticipated No. of \nGraduates  2 3 5 8 8 8 \nLow attrition is expected due to the niche this program will fill. It is expected that students will be \ngraduates of the Niveau II certificate program and will looking to advance their skills to \nsupervise or manage programs.  \nSECTION 2: DEMAND \n2.1 Student Demand Analysis \nAnalysis should be supported by relevant data for the region and for Campus Alberta, as might be \nderived from: systematic questionnaire surveys of target audiences; application and enrolment \nsummaries and trends for similar programs currently offered by other institutions; tabulations of \nunsolicited student inquiries and/or expressions of interest obtained at student recruitment events; \ndemographic projections for relevant sub-populations.  \nGiven Centre collégial de l’Alberta’s provincial mandate, the needs of the Francophone \ncommunity as well as those of the general public throughout Alberta have been taken into \naccount.  \nIn March 2016, Centre collégial de l’Alberta undertook an online survey among Francophone \nschool students in grades 10 to 12. We also sent the same survey to Francophone day care \ncenters to explore the possibility of workers wanting to go back to school or further their \ntraining. A total of 100 people filled out the survey, 97% of the responses were from grade 10 \nto 12 students from from Calgary (33%), Edmonton (26%) and North-Western Alberta (25%).  \nWhen we asked the question: Which programs interest you the most? A total of 59% chose \nÉducation à la petite enfance / Early Learning and Child Care, either the certificate (27%) or \nthe diploma (32%).  \n**Title: Which course interests you the most?(choose among the following). The choices listed \nare: Educational Assistant/Certificate, Early Chilhood/Certificate, Early Chilhood/Diploma, \nEducational Assistant-Special Education/Diploma.  \nStudents from grade 10 to 12 say they would choose the program that most interests them \nregardless of the length of the program, where it is offered, or the institution that provides it.  \n**Title: What is the most important thing to you when you choose a program? (Choose all \nanswers) The list of options includes: Where the program is offered, which institution offers the \nprogram, the program itself, whether courses are offered in class or online, the length of the \nprogram.  \n83% of the potential students answered that they would rather take a course given in a face-\nto-face delivery model than online.  \nThis information has been used to determine where online and face-to-face delivery are \nappropriate to the needs of the target audience. \n**Title: What do you prefer? The choices list: online learning and in class learning.  \nPrevious survey results also show strong interest in French language programming. In 2011, \nCentre collégial de l’Alberta initiated a survey in order to assess student interest in \nundertaking postsecondary college-level studies in French. An electronic survey instrument \nas well as a hard copy version were distributed to the Francophone and French Immersion \nschools in Alberta.  \nA total of 493 responses were received, of which approximately 45% were from Edmonton, \n18% from Calgary, with the remaining 37% of respondents from rural and northern Alberta. \nThe breakdown of respondents from Francophone schools and French Immersion schools \nshowed participation was almost equal, as was the distribution of respondents across grades \n10 (37%), 11(30%), and 12(33%). \nSchool # of Respondents % of Respondents  \nFrancophone 259 53 \nFrench \nImmersion \n234 47 \nTotal 493 100 \nGrade # of Respondents % of Respondents \nGrade 10 184 37 \nGrade 11 148 30 \nGrade 12 161 33 \nTotal 493 100 \nAmong the 493 survey respondents, 28% indicated without stipulation that they were \ninterested in pursuing postsecondary studies in French and an additional 56% indicated that \nthey would be interested in doing so subject to the availability of programs of interest to them, \nfor a total of 84% of respondents interested in studying in French.   \n**Title: How interested are you in pursuing post secondary studies in French? The choices \nprovided are: very interested, depending on available programs, not interested.  \n2.2 Labour Market Analysis \nAnalysis should be supported by relevant data and placed in the context of the target \noccupational/regional labour market(s). Relevant data sources include systematic surveys of \nprospective employers; occupational supply/demand projections from government or industry \nsources; tabulations of job postings/‘help wanted’ advertising; surveys of recruitment and \ngraduate employment rates of similar programs; and demographic projections (i.e. for \nrelevant regions and sub-populations.) Describe anticipated employment outcomes. \nIn the spring of 2016, the Fédération des parents francophones de l’Alberta (FPFA), a \nFrancophone community organization providing services to all French-language Alberta early \nchildhood service providers, released the results of a study regarding the child care spaces \navailable versus those needed in Francophone day care settings. Their results are based on \na Statistics Canada study and show that there is demand for about 1,180 places in \nfrancophone daycares in the province and that only 543 places were actually available. This \nanalysis demonstrates a shortfall of about 630 spaces to meet the actual demand. As more \nspaces are developed to meet this need, the need for qualified Child Development Workers \nable to work with children in a French-speaking and culturally inclusive environment will also \nincrease.  \nTheir study asked existing daycares about the number of names that were on the waiting list \nwith results indicating that 120 children/families were waiting for a place in francophone \ndaycare. The long waiting lists further amplifies the fact that more Francophone daycare \ncenters are needed. Table 1(Tableau 1) illustrates the specifics.  \nFédération des parents francophones, Augmenter le nombre de place garderie francophone en \nAlberta, Défis, réalité et recommandations, 2016, p.3 \n** This Table names all French speaking day care service providers who work within \ninstitutions (often annexed to Francophone schools) and those who provide French-language \ndayhome services. It provides information on accreditation, the total number of children \nregistered and the scope of the waiting list.  \nIn the same study, one survey was distributed to child care facilities (Graphique 1) and the \nsecond to family day homes (Graphique 2). The FPFA asked the administration to identify \nthe types of supports or resources that could help them to perform better. \nAfter analyzing and comparing the results of these two graphs, the most pressing needs \nidentified in the two types of settings are professional development (100% and 85%), the \ndiscovery of new practices (100% and 100%) and the creation of a network of educators \n(100% and 72%).  \nFédération des parents francophones, Augmenter le nombre de place garderie francophone en Alberta, Défis, \nréalité et recommandations, 2016, p.8**This graph shows how each support is ranked from “Very important” \nto “Not important” by those who responded to the survey.  \nFédération des parents francophones, Augmenter le nombre de place garderie francophone en Alberta, Défis, \nréalité et recommandations, 2016, p.9**This graph shows how each support is ranked from “Very important” \nto “Not important” by those who responded to the survey.  \nThe overall conclusion of the FPFA’s study is that there is a glaring shortage of places in \nFrench language daycare centers all over Alberta but particularly in Calgary and Edmonton. \nCurrent availability fills only 46% of the demand. Given these results, the FPFA will continue \nto lobby for an increase in francophone childcare spaces in Alberta. The FPFA also continues \nto provide ongoing administrative and mentoring supports to parents and communities \nthroughout Alberta who want to establish French language services. As more centers are \nopened to provide more spaces, more employment will be created increasing the demand for \nqualified personnel, trained to work within the specific French language context in Alberta. \nThe CCA has strong ties with the FPFA, its member associations and all Francophone school \nauthorities within the province.   \nThe Centre collégial de l’Alberta’s survey of Francophone community organizations and early \nchildhood education service providers show the need for workers. Response rates for \nFrancophone schools was 40%, for day care centers at 40%, for Francophone School \nAuthorities at 13% and for private day cares at 7%. All of the respondents agree that the \nneed of workers in this field continues to increase. Most of them (60%) say that there is \nactually a greater demand than in previous years.  \n**Title: In light of your experience in the field and in your professional opinion, how would you \nrate the demand for child development workers? The choices list: less than, equal to or greater \nthat previous years. \nAt the time the survey was taken, six institutional and private day care centers indicated that \nthey usually hire one or two employees per year whereas seven indicated that they usually \nhire five to ten. When we asked the question : «How many early childhood educators do you \nplan to hire over the next five years?» the results indicate that employers expect to need a \ngreater number over the coming years. The graph below shows this. Each letter represents \nan employer. The dark blue represents the number of educators employed at the time of \npolling, the light blue represents the number of educators they plan to hire over the next five \nyears.  \nAgain, the case can be made that the demand for qualified personnel, trained within the \ncontext of French language specificity will continue to increase.  \n2.3 Support \nProvide evidence of consultation with and approval/support from relevant professional organizations, \nregulatory bodies, advisory committees, employers, and/or industry. \nThe proposal benefits from strong support from internal and external stakeholders.  \nIn February 2016, a group of professionals and community organization representatives were \nconsulted to discuss the planning of the Centre collégial de l’Alberta for future years. During \nthis consultation, the committee was clear regarding the significance and the necessity of \ndeveloping a program in Early learning & Child Care in French offered by the CCA.  \nBoth the Centre collégial de l’Alberta’s Executive Committee and Community Consultative \nCommittee discussed the importance of seeking approval to offer this program over the same \nperiod. \nIn March 2016, the CCA received letters of support found in Appendix V.  \n2.4 Clinical or Work Experience \nIf clinical or work experience is an essential part of program delivery: \n2.4.1 Provide evidence that the placements will be available when needed. \nThe Centre collégial de l’Alberta is presently working in collaboration with Accès-emploi, a \nFrancophone work and career placement organization, in order to provide work experience to \nstudents. This collaboration will be helpful in finding work placements, as will working with the \nFédération des parents francophone de l’Alberta (FPFA), the network of Francophone \nschools in Alberta, and the two Albertan Francophone Parent Link Centres (Edmonton and \nCalgary). At this time, there are 13 daycare centers affiliated with Francophone schools who \nare working with the FPFA. As more Francophone schools are opened in Alberta, other \ncenters will be created.  Another strong ally in identifying work experience placements in a \nFrench speaking child care and development setting is the network of 13 regional offices of \nthe Association canadienne-française de l’Alberta (ACFA) spread province-wide. They are in \na position to liaise with us to identify private day cares. All these stakeholders support or \nprovide some form of early learning or childcare and/or development service in a French \nspeaking culturally sensitive and inclusive setting. \nPerhaps most importantly, since we estimate that many of the students completing this \nprogram will already be in the work force, working in the Early Learning and Child \nDevelopment field, we foresee that they will be able to complete some of the practicum hours \nin their workplace.  \n2.4.2 Describe the student’s role in securing placements. \nCollaboration with Accès-Emploi and other organizations will help students with work \nexperience placements and help them find employment once they obtain their diploma. \nStudents will be supported in finding placements. A guidebook, Guide pour les stages du \nprogramme Éducation à la petite enfance, for students will outline their responsibilities with \nregards to the work experience component of the program. These responsibilities include: \n- Completing course work of the program \n- Abiding by the University of Alberta Student Code of Conduct and conducting \nthemselves in an ethical and professional manner throughout the job search, interview \nand within their position. The University of Alberta Practicum Intervention Policy \n(http://www.governance.ualberta.ca/StudentAppeals/PracticumInterventionPolicy.aspx) \nwill apply should the need arise.  \n- Abiding by the employment standards indicated by the employer and respecting all \npolicies, rules, procedures and conditions set out for the position. \n2.4.3 Explain how the institution will supervise/monitor the learning experience of students in off-site \nsettings? \nA CCA representative will act as primary supervisor for each student placement site. The \nCCA Director will be responsible for the supervisor who will monitor student progress and \nprovide guidance and advice, when necessary. The supervisor will act as the liaison between \nthe Employer, the Student and the CCA. Their responsibilities will also be described in a \nguidebook, Guide pour les employeurs et les superviseurs du programme de \nl’éducation à la petite enfance. These will include : \n- Creating a provincial database of employers and potential employers in the area of \nÉducation à la petite enfance. \n- Facilitating communication between students, employers and the CCA staff as \ndeemed necessary. \n- Working with students and employers to identify learning opportunities within the \ncontext of job placements and establishing student-based reporting criteria on these \nhttp://www.governance.ualberta.ca/StudentAppeals/PracticumInterventionPolicy.aspx\nspecific learning opportunities.  \n- Informing students and employers about policies and procedures as deemed \nnecessary. This will include the Student Code of Conduct and the Practicum Intervention \nPolicy.  \n2.4.4 Identify potential employer/employee liability related to this aspect of the program, and how the \ninstitution intends to manage this liability. \nGiven that the Employer will take on a key role within the program, the CCA will ensure they \nunderstand their responsibilities towards the student by providing a guidebook and \nworkshops. These responsibilities include supervision of the student so as to ensure that the \nbest learning opportunities are provided to the students.  \nThe employer will have full oversight on the remuneration of the student (if applicable) and \nwill be responsible for maintaining Comprehensive General Liability coverage appropriate to \ntheir operations. Employers should also have Workers’ Compensation where applicable.  \nSECTION 3: INSTITUTIONAL AND SYSTEM CONTEXT \n3.1 Institutional Strategy \nHow does the proposed program align with the institution’s strategic priorities and the Comprehensive \nInstitutional Plan? \nThe Éducation à la petite enfance - Superviseur  diploma program is aligned with the \nUniversity of Alberta’s broadened mandate. One goal of the University of Alberta, as reflected \nin its strategic plan, “For the Public Good, is to connect with its communities, notably \nembracing and extending strengths such as la Francophonie at Campus Saint-Jean, in order \nto enhance the University’s interconnectedness with local communities. By drawing students \nfrom various Francophone communities as well as from the general public, and preparing \ngraduates to return to work environments in this milieu, the proposed program diploma \nprogram enhances this connectedness between the University of Alberta, Alberta and \nWestern Canada’s Francophonie and the growing interest for bilingualism (as manifested by \nenrollments in immersion programs) in the general population. This program will enhance the \nUniversity of Alberta’s reputation as a leader in French language postsecondary education \nwest of Winnipeg.  \nThe University of Alberta is currently the sole post-secondary institution in Alberta which has \nthe mandate to offer French-language college-level programs.  \n3.2 Institutional Programs \nExplain how the proposed program fits with existing programs at the institution, and the anticipated \npositive or negative impacts on other programs. \nNo negative impact is anticipated. There are currently no college-level Early Learning and \nChild Development certificate or diploma programs offered at the University of Alberta.  \n3.3 Internal Review and Approval \nProvide a brief description of the internal review and approval process followed in developing the \nproposal. \nUniversity of Alberta (U of A) internal review and approval to be done by : \n● Centre collégial de l’Alberta, Program Planning Committee (recommendation): April \n18, 2017 \n● Centre collégial de l’Alberta Executive Committee (approval) date : May 18, 2017 \n● Faculté Saint-Jean Faculty Council(for information only), date : October 6, 2017 \n● U of A General Faculties Council Academic Planning Committee ( approval), date : \nDecember 13, 2017 \n3.4 Campus Alberta Programs/Initiatives \nDiscuss the relationships (similarity, complementarity, transfer, competition) of the proposed program \nto other programs or initiatives in Campus Alberta and explain what the proposed program would add \nto the system. If the proposed program would duplicate existing programs, explain why that \nduplication is warranted.  \nThe Éducation à la petite enfance -Superviseur program offered by CCA will be unique in \nvarious ways. The most obvious differentiator is language, as the program will be offered in \nFrench within the context of a French language institution, Campus Saint-Jean. The \nperspective of first language development in a minority language and or bilingual setting as \nwell as ways by which to enrich early learning experiences with cultural elements will be fully \nexplored within the curriculum and be part of the student’s learning experience.  \nGraduates of the program will be able to work in either of Canada’s official languages. \nHowever, they will be particularly well suited for the French language environment. Courses \nwill be offered in a hybrid manner, which will include face-to-face teaching and learning, \nonline learning as well as on the job training. Some courses will be offered evenings and \nweekends in order to meet the needs of students. Face-to-face courses will be offered in \nGrande Prairie, Calgary and Edmonton, where deemed appropriate.  \nThe CCA has been involved in a three year partnership with Lakeland College by providing \nfunds through the Official Languages in Education Program (Federal funding) for their online \ndevelopment and offering of this program in French since 2014. This agreement was struck in \nan effort to meet the urgent need for bilingual, qualified Child Development Workers and \nSupervisors in the French-speaking community while CCA was undergoing its implementation \nphase. Now, CCA seeks accreditation so that it can offer a hybrid version of this diploma \nprogram in geographic areas such as Edmonton, Grande Prairie and Calgary.  \n3.5 Consultation \nSummarize the type and outcomes of consultations with other institutions offering related programs. \nAttach copies of relevant documents (e.g. letters, meeting summaries). Discuss the potential for inter-\ninstitutional collaboration.  \nThere have been ongoing discussions between CSJ/CCA representatives and Lakeland \nCollege representatives over the past 18 months. These discussions were held in order to \ndraw up a new agreement which would establish more common ground between the two \ninstitutions. Lakeland College representatives have indicated that they will continue offering \nthe program in years to come with or without CCA/UofA support.  CCA Executive Committee \nmembers have decided that CCA must pursue offering the program on its own. Labor market \nanalysis shows that it is a much needed program for the development of the community. CCA \nis strategically positioned to liaise with community members all over the province to offer a \nprogram anchored in language development in a minority context able to provide culturally \nrich learning experiences. \n3.6 Learner Pathways \n3.6.1 Identify potential pathways from work to school (where applicable). \nThis diploma program will be accessible to those who have completed the Education à la \npetite enfance- Niveau II certificate program. Should High School graduates have validated \ncourses through dual credit and if they meet language requirements, they could enter into the \nprogram.  \n3.6.2 Identify potential opportunities for transfer/laddering into the proposed program from other \ninstitutions or other programs within the institution; and for transfer/laddering from the proposed \nprogram to other programs within the institution or at other institutions. List any formal agreements \nfor internal or inter-institutional transfer/laddering that have been negotiated to this point. \nThe Education à la petite enfance - Superviseur diploma program will ladder from the \nEducation à la petite enfance- Niveau II certificate program. The Education à la petite \nenfance- Niveau II Certificate will contain the courses needed to obtain the Early Learning \nand Child Care (Child Development Assistant) designation, for those students who do not yet \nhave this qualification. If students already hold the Early Learning and Child Care (Child \nDevelopment Assistant) certification, three credits will be applied towards their Education à la \npetite enfance- Niveau II certificate. \n3.6.3 Estimate the portion of graduates who can be expected to proceed to further education \ndirectly. At a later stage in their careers. What types of programs/credentials would they be most \nlikely to pursue?  \nWe estimate that several certificate program graduates will proceed to the diploma level but \nfew graduates will proceed to further education directly after completing their Diploma \nprogram. At a later date however some may wish to continue their education in an undergrad \nprogram such as Campus Saint-Jean’s Baccalauréat en éducation. \nSECTION 4: FINANCIAL VIABILITY AND SUSTAINABILITY \n4.1 Annual Budget and Funding Sources \nIdentify annual and one-time expenditures and annual revenue for the program in the budget tables \nbelow. If program implementation will take place over more than one year, provide estimates for each \nyear until full implementation. Provide explanatory notes for all budget assumptions, such as inflation \nand per student tuition. \n(For proposals without significant impacts on institutional costs, revenues or enrolment, a detailed budget \npresentation will not normally be required (please confirm with the department). Such proposals will satisfy all of \nthe following tests: \n• The proposal is for a new specialization in an existing program, consisting of an innovative combination of \nexisting curricula. \n• Overall enrolment capacity in the program is maintained. \n• Excepting incidental administrative and promotional costs, no start-up or incremental operations costs are \nincurred.) \n Year 1 \nFALL \n2019 \nYear 2 Year 3 Year 4 Year 5 Annual \nOngoing \nRevenue       \nTuition and Related Fees1 $30156 $30156 $30156 $30156 $30156 $30156 \nRe-allocation from Existing \nPrograms $0 $0 $0 $0 $0 $0 \nOther Internal Sources2 $600,000 \n$600,00\n0 \n$600,00\n0 \n$600,00\n0 \n$600,00\n0 \n$600,000 \nExternal (Third Party) \nSources3 $140 000 $140 000 $140 000 $140 000 $140 000 $140 000 \nGOA (Identify source) $ 0  $ 0  $ 0 $ 0 $0 $ 0 \nOther (specify) $0 $0 $0 $0 $0 $0 \nTotal Revenue $770 156 $770 156 $770 156 $770 156 $770 156 $770 156 \nOperational Costs       \nSalaries, Wages and \nBenefits4 $120 000 $120 000 $120 000 $120 000 $120 000 $120 000 \nMaterials and Contracted \nServices5 $ 5 000 $ 5 000 $ 5 000 $5 000 $ 5 000 $ 5 000 \nOther Direct Costs6 $45 156 $45 156 $45 156 $45 156 $45 156 $45 156 \nIndirect Costs7 $600,000 \n$600,00\n0 \n$600,00\n0 \n$600,00\n0 \n$600,00\n0 \n$600,000 \nTotal Operational Costs6 $770 156 $770 156 $770 156 $770 156 $770 156 $770 156 \nNotes: \n1. Tuition and Related fees:  Included here is an estimate of revenue for the number of students expected  \nin the program on a part-time and on a full time basis.  Projected enrollment is relatively stable and  \nincludes part-time enrollments which are difficult to predict. Also, there are no increases in the  \ntuition fees that are predicted and it is not possible for us to project the increases in non-instructional  \nfees at this time.  This revenue is subtracted in the Direct Costs since they are not a revenue that can  \nbe accessed by CCA. Therefore, tuition and related fees were projected as a stable figure throughout the \n budget.  \n2. Other Internal Sources:  CCA receives an administration budget envelope which provides funding  \nfor CCA basic operations.  At this time, two full programs are being offered, one in going through the  \napproval process at GoA, and two programs are offered through a collaboration agreement.  General  \noperations as well as supports to students and staff are taken into account within a Cost Sharing  \nAgreement established between Faculté Saint-Jean and Centre collegial de l’Alberta.  These include, but  \nare not limited to, general IT supports and maintenance, student support services, rental for spaces used  \nby CCA, general promotion of CCA within CSJ.   This sum is withdrawn in the Indirect Costs.   \n3. Identify the source and duration of external funding and outline any terms, conditions, and deliverables associated \nwith the funding. External (Third Party) Sources might include support from other levels of government; e.g., the \nGovernment of Canada. Funding from OLE, Canadian Heritage \n4. Salaries, Wages and Benefits: Teaching Staff: 1 Full-time instructor (salary and benefits \n: 100K, no PhD)(Program coordination is taken into account in the EPE certificate program) Additional part-time junior \ntech  \nsupport shared with other programs(10K), Additional % of recruitment coordinator salary (10K) \n5. Contracted Services: A contract will be offered to a placement agency to provide workshops and support to  \nstudents seeking practicum placements. \n6. Other Direct Costs: Direct costs include projected tuition and related fees which stay with the University \n(30156$), student bursaries(10K), program specific promotional efforts and materials(2500$ and 2500$).  \n7. All other cost, associated with providing this program and with providing support to students and staff are  \ntaken into account within the Cost Sharing Agreement established between Campus Saint-Jean and Centre  \ncollegial de l’Alberta. The Cost Sharing Agreement benefits from another source of funding, through the CCA  \nAdministration budget envelope granted by Alberta Advanced Education.  \nOne-time \nexpenditures \nAmount Revenue Source Details \nFacilities $   \nEquipment and IT $   \nCurriculum \nDevelopment $100 000 \nOLE Program  Acquisition/adaptation / \ndevelopment of curriculum. \nMarketing and \nPromotion $ \nFaculty Recruitment \nand Establishment $ \nLibrary Enhancements    \nOther $   \n4.2 Impact \n4.2.1 Compare the proposed tuition rate with that of similar programs in Campus Alberta. \nProposed tuition rate for Éducation à la petite enfance—Niveau II Certificate  program: \nCanadian students: \nTuition for program: ($47.12/fi)  $3,581.12 full-time student for the program \nTotal fees: as determined by UA, students are subject to all mandatory fees.  \nInternational Students \nTuition for program: ($130.82/fi)  $9,942.32 for full-time student.  \nTotal fees: as determined by UA, students are subject to all mandatory fees.  \nProposed tuition fees are similar to rates established in other institutions. Tuition rates for \nboth Canadian students and International students are slightly lower than in other institutions \noffering this program. Fees are significantly higher than in other institutions.  \n4.2.2 Discuss the financial impact on students and the learner funding system, taking into account the \ncosts of education and the potential debt burden relative to post-graduation earning capacity. \nFunding options by way of student loans for Alberta students and student bursaries provided \nby CCA and various endowment funds will be available to students. Since this is a one year \nprogram, the financial burden is lower than other programs and is in line with post-graduation \nearning capacity and workforce hiring capacity.  \n4.2.3 If program funding includes internal reallocation, evaluate the impact of this reallocation on the \ninstitution’s operations and overall financial position. \nNot applicable.  \nSECTION 5: QUALITY ASSESSMENT \n5.1 Institutional Capacity \n5.1.1 List instructional positions that would support the proposed program, specifying position \ntitle, credential and experience requirements, and areas of expertise. Distinguish between new and \nexisting positions; and regular and sessional appointments. Describe mechanisms (existing and \nplanned) to develop and ensure currency of teaching skills and disciplinary expertise. \nThe instructional positions necessary to offer the program will be equivalent to one and a half \nfull-time positions for the period of instruction (full-time and/or sessional lecturers). One full-time \nposition will be created (AST-12 month). CCA will seek instructional staff with the best expertise \nand language skills to provide quality instruction and will give preference to instructors with \npractical experience. Part of the instructional duty may be covered by instructors already \nworking at CSJ.  \n5.1.2 List instructional support positions (e.g. lab technicians, tutors) related to the proposed \nprogram.  \nCSJ technical support and distance learning support staff will work collaboratively with \ninstructional staff and with students to ensure that the e-learning platform (Moodle) meets \ntheir needs for the online delivery portion of the program. No new support positions will be \ndeveloped for this program.  \n5.1.3 Describe facilities, equipment and information resources (existing and planned) that would \nhouse and support delivery of the proposed program. \nAn online learning platform, Moodle, will host courses for distance learning. Classroom \nspace for face-to-face delivery in various regions of Alberta will be part of our negotiations \nwith the appropriate Campus Alberta partners.  \n5.1.4 Discuss the anticipated impacts of the proposed program on student support services. \nBecause of the fairly low number of expected students, it is anticipated that there will not \nbe a significant impact on student support services at CSJ, which is hosting approximately \n700 students this academic year. Students in the Education à la petite enfance--\nSuperviseur program will participate in student services to the same degree as FSJ \nundergraduate students. These services include technical support, support with specific \nsoftware, writing support in French and in English.  \n5.2 Curriculum  \nDescribe the process of development and validation of curriculum for the proposed program. If available, \nplease attach external review documents. \nCCA will develop the Education à la petite enfance – Superviseur diploma certificate program \nusing both the Normes de certification des services de garde d’enfants de l’Alberta and the \nimplementation of the framework Jeu, participation et possibilités: Un cadre pédagogique pour \nles programmes d’apprentissage et de garde des jeunes enfants en Alberta. These tools will \nprovide a basis for guiding students on how to use and adapt these norms to the French \nlanguage early childhood learning environment.  \nTo supplement these resources, CCA will collaborate with partners at the national level to learn \nfrom best practice in early-childhood education in a minority context in Canada. A fundamental \npart of the programming will be adapting the offering of services in French in a minority \nlanguage context, of developing language and culture as an integral part of the early learning \nand childcare experience.  \nFurthermore, the CCA will benefit from the expertise of CSJ’s faculty whose research is in the \narea of child development and early childhood education as well as stakeholders in the field. \nThey will be asked to participate in the validation of course objectives, workplace competencies \nand course content as course objectives are being identified.   \n5.3 Academic Standards \nList the requirements for admission and any alternate routes to admission; for residency; for academic \nprogression; and for graduation. Compare these requirements to those for similar programs. \n1. General requirements for admission \nCandidates for Éducation à la petite enfance -- Superviseur diploma program must have \nsuccessfully completed all requirements for the Éducation à la petite enfance—Niveau II \ncertificate program with a GPA of at least 2.0. Students who successfully complete the course \nrequirements for the Certificate program with less than 2.0 GPA will require permission from the \nCCA to enroll in the Diploma program.  \nAlso, students are expected to ensure that their immunizations are up to date, for their safety. \nRelevant information about recommended immunizations will be included with their admission \npackage.  \nAll students are expected to submit a police information check, including a vulnerable sector \nclearance, on the first day of classes. Failure to do so will result in withdrawal from the \npracticum courses in the program.  \n2. Academic Standing and Graduation \nStudent academic and practicum performance will be reviewed each semester.  \nStudents who fail two or more courses in a semester will be placed on academic probation for \nthe following semester.  \nStudents who fail three courses will be required to withdraw for one semester from the full-time \nprogram. Readmission to the program on a part-time basis will be subject to CCA review.  \n3. Graduation \nTo qualify for graduation, students are required to validate English Language competency, pass \nall courses and be successful in the compulsory practica. A minimum grade point average of 2.0 \nis required for graduation. Courses must have been taken within the last 5 years.   \n5.4 Learning Outcomes   \n5.4.1 Summarize the learning outcomes of the proposed program (e.g. career-specific knowledge \nand skills, employability skills).  \nThe Éducation à la petite enfance--Superviseur diploma program prepares graduates to work \nas supervisors in providing quality childcare in a wide variety of French speaking or bilingual \nsettings. They will also oversee the planning of developmentally appropriate activities for the \nchildren in their care or in a variety of settings.  The learning outcomes of the proposed \nprogram are designed such that the number of hours accessed for each category of course \nareas and practicum experiences meet the requirements laid out by the government of \nAlberta for the certification of Child Development Supervisors.  \n5.4.2 Describe the consultative process with employers, industry/professional bodies or advisory \ngroups that helped formulate these learning outcomes. \nThe learning outcomes have been established through consultation with various \nFrancophone community stakeholders who are active in the support and offering of early \nlearning and child care programs in Alberta, the Fédération des parents francophones de \nl’Alberta, Canadian Parents for French, principals and curriculum consultants from the \nFrancophone Education Authorities, the ACFA service centers in certain areas of the \nprovince.  \n5.4.3 Provide evidence of alignment/compliance with regulatory, industry, program accreditation and \nprofessional accreditation standards relevant to the program. \nThis program provides the requisite training for accreditation for the Early Learning and Child \nCare, Supervisor as determined by Alberta Human Services.  \n5.5 Institutional Quality Assurance   \n5.5.1 Describe the criteria and methods for evaluating the success of the program and achieving \ncontinuous quality improvement. Include expected outcomes, key performance indicators and \nperformance targets for the program.  \n● Quality of programs \n● Quality of instruction \n● Quality and quantity of opportunities for practice-based learning \n● Sustained enrollment \n● Completion rate of at least 75%, in the five years following enrollment into the \nprogram.  \n● Levels of satisfaction: students and graduates, employers, instructors \n● Financial sustainability \nThe success of the diploma program Éducation à la petite enfance--Superviseur   will be \ntracked using these indicators.  Targets for these indicators have been established in the \nCCA Strategic Plan and results will be tracked and reported to the appropriate stakeholders. \nProgram curriculum will be reviewed every three years using the above criteria as well as \neCampus standards and the Campus Alberta Quality Council guidelines.  \n5.5.2 Indicate whether a program advisory committee is planned or in place and, if so, comment \non the role of the committee in program quality assurance.  \nPresently, the CCA Community Consultative Council, composed of various community \nstakeholders meets twice a year. Their role is primarily to provide advice to the CCA \nExecutive Committee regarding all matters concerning programming. Until a specific program \ncommittee is struck, the CCC-CCA will advise on program quality assurance, as will the EC-\nCCA.   \nOnce the program is operational, a specific program committee, the Comité consultatif--\nprogrammes en éducation du CCA will be struck. Representatives from the Fédération des \nconseils scolaires de l’Alberta, the Fédération des parents francophones de l’Alberta, day \ncare centers, day homes, teaching staff, students, alumni will be convened. Their mandate \nwill include program quality assurance through a process approved by the EC-CCA.  \nRECOMMENDATION (FOR DEPARTMENT USE) \nDo Any Issues or Information Gaps Remain? \nRecommendation(s) \nReviewer(s) \nDate Completed \nAPPENDIX I – COURSE LIST, HRS, CREDITS \nDIPLOME, Éducation à la petite enfance  \nEPE 201 Les relations organisationnelles, 45 hrs, 3 credits \nEPE 202 Les relations interpersonnelles, 45 hrs, 3 credits \nEPE 203 Les fondements de l’éducation à la petite enfance, 45 hrs, 3 credits \nEPE 212 Curriculum émergent, 45 hrs, 3 credits  \nEPE 213 Le développement langagier et la littératie, 45 hrs, 3 credits \nEPE 222 Le développement de l’enfant III, 45 hrs, 3 credits \nEPE 223 Le développement sensoriel, 45 hrs, 3 credits \nEPE 226 L’intégration des enfants avec des besoins particuliers II, 45 hrs, 3 credits \nEPE 241 L’enfant, la famille et la communauté, 45 hrs, 3 credits \nEPE 242 Travailler avec la famille, 45 hrs, 3 credits \nEPE 250 Stage III, 200 hrs, 5 credits \nEPE 251 Stage IV, 200 hrs, 5 credtis  \nDiploma, Éducation à la petite enfance—Superviseur \nEPE 201 Organizational Relationships, 45 hrs, 3 credits \nEPE 202 Interpersonal Relationships, 45 hrs, 3 credits \nEPE 203 Childhood Foundations, 45 hrs, 3 credits \nEPE 212 Emergent Curriculum, 45 hrs, 3 credits  \nEPE 213 Language Development and Litteracy, 45 hrs, 3 credits \nEPE 222 Child Development III, 45 hrs, 3 credits \nEPE 223 Sensory Development, 45 hrs, 3 credits \nEPE 226 Exploring Exceptionalitites II, 45 hrs, 3 credits \nEPE 241 Child, Family, Community, 45 hrs, 3 credits \nEPE 242 Working with Families, 45 hrs, 3 credits \nEPE 250 Practicum III, 200 hrs, 5 credits \nEPE 251 Practicum IV, 200 hrs, 5 credtis  \nAPPENDIX IB – COURSES DESCRIPTION \nCourse name Description hours credits \nRequired Courses – Éducation à la petite enfance--Superviseur \nEPE 201 \nOrganizational \nRelationships \nEPE 201  \nLes relations \ninterpersonnelles  \nThis course integrates the humanistic perspective into the \norganizational frameworks of early childhood settings.

The new faculty name was selected as it 1:  \n- Enhances understanding and recognition of the Faculty’s work \n- Is clearly understood by employers, funders and stakeholders \n- Defines the Faculty at the provincial, national and international level \n- Establishes a claim on areas/disciplines at the University of Alberta \n1 Faculty Renaming Backgrounder (May, 2017) \n1.3.2 Is comparable nomenclature used for similar programs/specializations offered across \nCampus Alberta and, where relevant, in other jurisdictions? \nYes,  \nKinesiology, kinetics or human kinetics are the most predominant names used in \nprimary titles of faculties/colleges/departments either as a stand-alone name or in \nconjunction with other terms, included in 17 of 23 Canadian Universities that were \nsurveyed1.  \nWithin Alberta, the University of Calgary offers a Masters of Kinesiology (MKin) and the \nUniversity of Lethbridge offers a Master of Arts in Kinesiology. \nOur new degree is differentiated by the inclusion of Sport, and Recreation. \nSECTION 2:  SYSTEM IMPACT  \n2.1  Impact on Learners (Answer the following questions) \n2.1.1 Were students consulted regarding this proposed name change? If so, what was the \nfeedback received as a result of this consultation? \nOver the past academic year FPER Faculty members, staff, students, alumni and stakeholders \nwere given the opportunity to provide input on a new Faculty name. After a formal process, \nFaculty Council endorsed the name Faculty of Kinesiology, Sport, and Recreation. Updating \nthe degree specializations will align with the proposed Faculty name change. \nIn preparation for putting forward a name for the faculty name change, a specific meeting \nwas help with graduate students from our faculty. They were very supportive of replacing \nPhysical Education with Kinesiology and a majority made it clear that they desired keeping \nthe term Recreation in the faculty name. The addition of Sport in the faculty name was not \ndiscussed at this meeting specifically but was brought forward a subsequent faculty meetings \nin which graduate student representatives were present.  \nOn October 16 2017 we circulated a survey to our graduate students. The 82 students that \nresponded represented over half of the approximately 144 graduate students in our faculty. \nBy far, the name that most represented their degree was “Kinesiology, Sport, and Recreation” \nwith 70% of respondents ranked this name as a 4 or 5 on a scale of 1-5, with 1 being \"not \nrepresentative\" and 5 being \"very representative\". This proportion was almost identical (i.e. \n73%) in the subsample of 11 students who were currently in the M.A. (Thesis) Degree. In \ncomparison, less than 20% of our grad students (and only 36% of M.A. Thesis students) \nranked the current degree name as a 4 or 5. We have fewer M.A. course-based students (only \n4 respondents to our survey) and from what can be seen from this very small sample size, the \npreference for the proposed vs current name was similar. \n2.1.2 Describe benefits for students of proposed new name. \n1 Faculty Renaming Backgrounder (May, 2017) \nThe new degree name better defines and describes the teaching and research activities within \ntheir degree. The inclusion of the word Kinesiology is relevant most students in our faculty, \nas this name is the most recognized across Canada. The new name will both define and \ndifferentiate the degree at the national and international level, thus helping to attract top \nquality students, and help them to obtain employment by using a name that is more aligned \nwith the field. \n2.1.3 Describe plans to accommodate:  \na) active students who may wish to graduate with the established credential; and \nb)  previous graduates who may request to exchange their parchment for one \nwith the new program or specialization name. \nOnce it is approved by the Government, active students will be given the option to stay with \nthe 'old' name for the program to which they were admitted or change to the new name (i.e., \nMaster of Arts in Kinesiology, Sport, and Recreation). \nWe would also be open to allow previous graduates to exchange their parchment for one with \nthe new program or specialization name.  \n2.2  Potential Risks (Identify the potential risks associated with implementing the name \nchange, if any, and your institution’s risk mitigation strategies.) \nNo risks are anticipated. \n2.3  Consultation/Collaboration (Answer the following questions) \n2.3.1 Identify which stakeholder groups, if any, were consulted:  \n  Faculty \n  Advisory committee \n  Regulatory \nbodies/professional associations \n  Employers \n Other (identify below) \nGraduate students, \nundergraduate students, alumni \n2.3.2 Summarize feedback received including anticipated impacts on stakeholders. \nThe feedback was first received from stakeholders at the time of the faculty name change to \nKinesiology, Sport, and Recreation. This feedback was not specific to the graduate degree \nnames, but was received from stakeholders included alumni, employers, staff, faculty, current \ngraduate students, and the Physical Education and Recreation Graduate Student Society \n1 Faculty Renaming Backgrounder (May, 2017) \n(PERGSS). While this consultation was not directly in the area of the degree name changes, \nmany of the data collected and arguments that led to the Faculty name change are also directly \napplicable to the degree name changes.  We received overwhelming and consistent support for \nreplacing the term Physical Education for Kinesiology. While this was in the context of the \nfaculty name, it reflects the fact that kinesiology is the term that is most recognized in the field \n(e.g., Alumni and Employers) and is therefore relevant to the degree name changes. We also \nreceived strong support to keep the term “Recreation” in the faculty name as about 50% of \nstudents and alumni felt the term recreation accurately describes a core area of the Faculty’s \nacademic mission and offerings1. The term “Sport” was included as this term is recognized \ninternationally and also represented many of our teaching, research and service activities 1. \nAs described above in section 2.1.1, we surveyed our current graduate students regarding \nchanges to their degree name changes. We had a high response rate and responses that were very \nconsistent with the responses obtained at the time of the faculty name change.  \n2.4  Communication (Describe how information about the name change will be communicated \nto students and applicants.) \nCurrent graduate students are aware that our Faculty Council approved the faculty name change. \nThey have been informed by e-mail of the faculty name change. As part of the survey sent out in \nOctober to students regarding their degree name changes, they have been informed that “In the \nevent of a change to the names of our graduate degrees, current students will retain the option of \ngraduating with a degree in Physical Education and Recreation.” Based on our survey results, we \nexpect that over 70% of our current MA students will prefer to change their degree name to an \nMA in Kinesiology, Sport, and Recreation  \nIn regards to the degree names, applications will remain the same for current applicants until the \nname change has been approved by Advanced Education. At which time, depending on the \neffective date of the approval, the new degree names will be inserted in admissions letter and the \nchange will be explained.  \nSECTION 3: INSTITUTIONAL AND REGULATORY APPROVAL/SUPPORT  \n3.1 Provide specific information about which internal governance body approved this proposed \nname change.

Before graduate degree specializations are \napproved by the FGSR, it must be clear that the department’s proposed designation does not require \nsignificant additional resources, that it has sufficient viability in terms of numbers of academic staff in the \nresearch area, and that a library impact assessment has been completed. \nAccording to the Academic Planning Committee’s terms of reference, all proposals for the establishment of \ngraduate degree specializations shall be submitted to the Dean of the Faculty of Graduate Studies and \nResearch. The Dean, after consultation, may approve proposals which do not involve base operating or \ncapital funds; the Dean will report these approvals to the Academic Planning Committee for information. \nListed below are proposals approved since April 1, 2017. \nSPH: termination of MPH in Public Health Leadership; suspension of MSc in Health Technology Assessment; \nsuspension of MSc in Occupational Health \nDepartment of Educational Policy Studies \nSpecialization  in MEd, EdD and PhD Rename Specialization as \nTheoretical, Cultural, and International Studies in \nEducation \nSocial Justice and International Studies in \nEducation \nThe purpose of this calendar change is to change the name of the specialization from Theoretical, \nCultural, and International Studies in Education (TCI) to Social Justice & International Studies in \nEducation (SJI). While the TCI label has served the specialization well for some two decades now, it \nwas strongly felt by all concerned that it was time to update the name for the following reasons: (1) \nto better reflect the work of the associated (current) faculty contingent; (2) adjust to the shifting \nacademic terrain/nomenclatures in the social sciences and education since the terms TCI were first \nproposed; and (3) for purposes of better translation for publics served by the specialization (e.g. \nrather than TC, social justice speaks to the explicit social purpose of TC studies today and in a \nmanner that potential students/others are currently better able to comprehend/relate to).  \nEffective July 1, 2018 for new admissions and for continuing students. \nApproved:  Ed Policy Studies Grad Students Assn on Sept 6, 2017; Dept of Ed Policy Studies  Sept \n15, 2017; Grad Acad Affairs Cmte  Faculty of Education  Oct 12, 2017;  Dean, FGSR Oct 30, 2017. \nGFC ACADEMIC PLANNING COMMITTEE\nFor the Meeting of December 13, 2017\nItem No. 11\nhttp://www.gradstudies.ualberta.ca/\nFaculty of Graduate Studies and Research \n2 \nMedical Sciences \nSpecialization in MSc and PhD  Rename Specialization as \nMedical Sciences-Ophthalmology Medical Sciences-Ophthalmology and Visual Sciences \nThe request to change the degree program names from Medical Sciences-Ophthalmology to \nMedical Sciences-Ophthalmology and Visual Sciences was initiated to specifically address the \nlimited scope of \"Ophthalmology\" which was a clinical designation. We wanted to broaden the \nname to include \"Visual Sciences\" in order that graduate students would receive their degree \nunder the amended name. As a consequence of the name change, the Department would possibly \nbe more attractive to students interested in a postgraduate degree program at the UofA. \nEffective September 1, 2017 \nApproved by: FoMD March 22, 2017 (with support from Medical Sciences); Dean FGSR April 24, \n2017; reported to FGSR Council in the Governance Report at the May 5, 2017 meeting. \nSchool of Public Health \nSpecialization in MPH (Master of \nPublic Health) \nTERMINATION \nPublic Health Leadership   \nThis termination had been previously approved in 2011 but had not been removed from the \nCalendar.
