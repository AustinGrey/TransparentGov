            "Description": "Purpose of the Proposal: To provide committee members with an overview of the Awards and Bursaries for Students Policy and related procedures in UAPPOL in an effort to identify institutional policy and procedures related to the committee’s mandate. This will prepare members for the upcoming discussions on amendments to committee terms of reference, as per the GFC ad hoc Committee on Academic Governance Including Delegated Authority. Discussion: Following a review of the Awards and Bursaries for Students Policy, as well as the Awards for Undergraduate Students Procedure, the Bursaries for Students Procedure, the Creation of New Awards and Bursaries for Undergraduate Students Procedure, and the University Medal Requirements Procedure, the committee raised several issues. On the subject of the GFC-delegated authority to approve the minimum value of items, members expressed that it seems to be an administrative task and that they lack the kind of data needed to make such decisions. It was noted that Administration had recently changed the minimum value of items without committee input. The current amount was now $1000. Members discussed the terminology within the policy and procedures, and it was suggested that individual definitions for each type of award be discontinued in alignment with current practices within the field. The new common term is “financial support”. This led members to suggest that perhaps the committee name was outdated, since it referenced scholarships. Members discussed the committee’s mandate over the establishment of a full normal course load between two or more Faculties, pointing out that the committee had not been doing so, nor was there a need to, since Faculties seem to work this out between themselves. Members questioned their role in fulfilling this mandate. Other issues identified by members included how student accommodations are handled; the authority of the GFC Executive Committee over academic awards; that minimum averages of entrance scholarships may need revision; the definition and application of a disadvantaged group; and the necessity and relevance of the University Medals Procedure. The Chair thanked members for their thoughtful discussion and noted that the conversation on the issues would continue, leading up to revision of the committee terms of reference.",

TYPES OF AWARDS  \nThe University offers a variety of awards to undergraduate students, including scholarships, prizes, and \nUniversity medals. Scholarships, prizes and University medals, which have as their primary criterion \nsuperior academic achievement, are considered the most prestigious awards for students within the \nUniversity.  Awards that do not meet the definitions for scholarships, prizes or University medals are known \nsimply as general awards and have as their primary criterion satisfactory academic standing.   \n2. COURSE LOAD REQUIREMENTS \nAll awards established by the University, with the exception of prizes and unless otherwise specified by the \nterms of reference, will normally be available to all meritorious students who have completed a full normal \ncourse load, as determined by their Faculty, over the most recent September-August period. Students on a \ncooperative studies portion of their program will be considered for awards when they have completed a full \nnormal course load. Faculties have the option of allowing students who are enrolled in less than a full normal \ncourse load for other reasons including, but not limited to, field schools and work experience to be nominated \nfor awards when they have accumulated a full normal course load. Faculties will work with the Student \nAwards Office to track these students.   \n3. UNDERGRADUATE AWARD ADMINISTRATION \nUnless otherwise stated in the terms of any award, undergraduate awards administered by Student Financial \nSupport are tenable only at the University of Alberta. Where an award is listed in a particular Faculty, it is \ngenerally tenable only in that Faculty (except course prizes, which are open to any student registered in that \ncourse).  \nNormally, all monetary awards are payable only when students are in actual full-time attendance at the \nUniversity in the term during which funds are dispersed. Awards that are offered prior to the commencement \nof or within a Fall Term will be divided evenly between the Fall Term and the Winter Term. If the student \nreturns for one term of study or to part-time studies, the award value will normally be pro-rated.   \nAwards given at the time of a student’s graduation will be paid out in full following convocation.. \n4. MAJOR AWARDS \nIn order that funds may be broadly distributed, an undergraduate student may hold only one University of \nhttps://policiesonline.ualberta.ca/policiesprocedures/policies/awards-and-bursaries-for-students-policy.pdf\n  U of A Policies and Procedures On-Line (UAPPOL) \nAlberta major award per category (leadership, academics, athletics, fine arts) in any one year. Total value of \nother awards received by students through any other competition(s) may also be taken into consideration in \nopen award competitions.  \n5. EXTERNAL AWARDS  \nStudent Financial Support may, at its discretion, publicize awards available to University of Alberta students \nfrom sources outside the University.  \n6. TERMS OF REFERENCE  \nFor awards already approved, where terms of reference for specific awards contradict the regulations \nprovided in this procedure, the terms of reference will supersede these regulations.    \n7. TRANSCRIPTS \nOnly awards based on superior academic achievement, which have been approved by the GFC \nUndergraduate Awards and Scholarship Committee and are administered through Student Financial Support \nwill be listed on the academic transcript of an undergraduate student. \nDEFINITIONS \nAny definitions listed in the following table apply to this document only with no implied or intended \ninstitution-wide use.
