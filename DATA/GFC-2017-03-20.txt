Dr Rodgers reported that there is a general lack of awareness of the broad scope of writing support at the university and it is important to coordinate what exists and make it more visible. A digital hub linking students to writing supports is being developed to help connect these services to those who may require it. Dr Costopolous reported that the recommendations include a reinvigoration of the University Writing Committee and the central coordination of scholarly writing supports by the Office of the Provost and Vice-President (Academic) to ensure that all supports adhere to established principles. During the discussion, a member thanked the presenters for the report and indicated optimism at the clearer role of the University Writing Committee.",

I’ve highlighted those developments in the following pages. Of particular note are:  \n• our committed responses to the Truth and Reconciliation Commission’s Calls to Action originating \nfrom across the university;  \n• continued momentum in the Signature Areas development process;  \n• and the university’s clear dedication to building—and supporting—a diverse and inclusive \ncommunity, especially within a climate of increasing divisiveness.  \nMoving forward, we will also prioritize experiential learning and professional development \nopportunities.  \nOne of my continuing goals is to introduce the plan to the wider community, and share broadly the \nvision and aspirations of the university for the next five years. I have identified a few of my own key \ntalking points for the coming months throughout this report.  \n2 \nOFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT  \n2-24 South Academic Building (SAB)  |  Edmonton, Alberta, Canada T6G 2G7  |  president.ualberta.ca \nIndigenous Initiatives \nIndigenous Canada  \nBeginning in March 20, the University of Alberta will offer a new MOOC (Massive Open Online \nCourse) called Indigenous Canada. The MOOC explores Indigenous histories and contemporary \nissues in Canada, highlighting national and local Indigenous-settler relations. Accessible public \neducation initiatives are one of the ways in which we are responding to the Truth and Reconciliation \nCommission’s Calls to Action. \nKEY TALKING POINT:  \nThrough initiatives like the new MOOC, Indigenous Canada, the \nUniversity of Alberta encourages students, faculty, staff, and the \nbroader community to become active participants in reconciliation.   \nIndigenous Cultural Support Office \n2017 has also seen the opening of the new Indigenous Cultural Support Office on North Campus. \nOne of the office’s primary objectives is to provide cultural supports for both Indigenous and non-\nIndigenous staff and faculty—much as the Aboriginal Student Services Centre provides supports for \nour students. \nU.S. Travel Ban and International Applicants \nThe recent United States travel ban had an immediate impact on our university community, and \npresented urgent challenges for the hundreds of U of A students, staff, and academics carrying \npassports from the affected countries.  \nIn response, the university took three key actions:  \n1. We established an information hub to support staff, students, and faculty affected by \nthe ban  \n2. I issued a statement on behalf of the University of Alberta reaffirming our \ncommitment to diversity, inclusion, and equity  \n3. We waived application fees for citizens of the seven countries affected by the U.S. \ntravel ban \nI am consistently proud of our community’s responses in the face of isolationism, division, and \nadversity. Taken together, these responses ensure that our community will remain diverse, \ninclusive, resilient, and safe for everyone. \nhttps://www.ualberta.ca/courses/indigenous-canada\nhttps://www.ualberta.ca/news-and-events/newsarticles/2017/february/travel-ban-grounds-more-than-travel-to-the-us\nhttps://www.ualberta.ca/travel-ban-information\nhttp://blog.ualberta.ca/2017/01/president-turpin-affirms-ualberta.html\n3 \nOFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT  \n2-24 South Academic Building (SAB)  |  Edmonton, Alberta, Canada T6G 2G7  |  president.ualberta.ca \nAboriginal Justice Externship \nThis semester, Faculty of Law students started into a new criminal law course: the Aboriginal \nJustice Externship on Gladue Sentencing Principles. Combining seminars with experiential \nlearning, the new course sees students conduct 25-30 hours of externship work directly with \nGladue report writers. It is the first course of its kind to be offered in a Canadian law school. The \nAboriginal Justice Externship responds to a nation-wide call that Canadian law schools ensure \ncultural competency training for lawyers. \nExperiential Learning Working Group \nOne of our next strategic priorities will be focused on curricular, co-curricular, and extracurricular \nexperiential learning opportunities for students.  \nFollowing recommendations from the most recent senior administration retreat, the Provost’s \nOffice is starting with two key actions:  \n1. They are conducting an environmental scan to look at existing experiential learning \nopportunities at the U of A. They will work with the faculties to explore the current \nexperiential options and identify opportunities. The Faculty of Arts, for example, has \nalready set up a comprehensive experiential learning site.  \n2. They are creating a working group to guide the experiential learning development \nprocess. One of its first tasks will be to review the environmental scan, and \ndetermine the next steps to developing experiential learning at the U of A. \nhttps://www.ualberta.ca/law/news/main-news/2017/january/gladue-sentencing-principles\nhttps://www.ualberta.ca/law/news/main-news/2017/january/gladue-sentencing-principles\nhttps://www.ualberta.ca/arts/programs/experiential\n4 \nOFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT  \n2-24 South Academic Building (SAB)  |  Edmonton, Alberta, Canada T6G 2G7  |  president.ualberta.ca \nSignature Areas \nThe Signature Areas proposal process closed on January 28, and we received 57 proposals in \ntotal. A development panel has begun reviewing these proposals against the criteria we laid out in \nFor the Public Good.  The panelists have already remarked on the extraordinary connections and \ncollaborations taking shape through the proposal process.  \nPlease join us at a campus forum on March 23, 2017 for an extensive update on the Signature \nAreas development process.   \nYou can learn more about the signature area development process on the For the Public Good \nwebsite.  \nKEY TALKING POINT:  \nFrom our broad strength as a research-intensive university, we are \nhighlighting areas of global distinction by building a portfolio of \nsignature areas. \nAcademic Excellence \nThe University of Alberta ranked 31st on the Times Higher Education’s 2017 list of the world’s most \ninternational universities. We were also named in the top 100 in 25 subjects – including 10th in the \nworld for sports-related subjects – in the QS World University Rankings by Subject 2017. \nDistinguished University Professor Emerita Liz Ingram has been appointed a Member of the Order \nof Canada for her contributions in visual arts. Ms. Ingram’s distinguished career has previously \nearned her fellowship in the Royal Society of Canada, as well as the U of A’s highest academic \nhonour: the University Cup.  \nDr. Philip Halloran, founder of the Alberta Transplant Applied Genomics Centre, received an \nhonorary degree from Paris Descartes University this winter. The HD recognizes Dr. Halloran’s \nground-breaking work in organ transplantation. \nhttps://www.ualberta.ca/strategic-plan/institutional-priorities/signature-areas-development\nhttps://www.ualberta.ca/strategic-plan\nhttps://www.ualberta.ca/strategic-plan/institutional-priorities/signature-areas-development\nhttps://www.ualberta.ca/strategic-plan/institutional-priorities/signature-areas-development\nhttps://www.ualberta.ca/why-ualberta/rankings/news/2017/february/ualberta-ranks-31st-in-time-higher-educations-new-most-international-rankings\nhttps://www.ualberta.ca/news-and-events/newsarticles/2017/march/ualberta-named-in-worlds-top-100-for-unprecedented-25-subjects-in-latest-qs-rankings\nhttps://www.ualberta.ca/medicine/news/2017/january/global-bonds-that-make-history\nhttps://www.ualberta.ca/medicine/news/2017/january/global-bonds-that-make-history\n5 \nOFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT  \n2-24 South Academic Building (SAB)  |  Edmonton, Alberta, Canada T6G 2G7  |  president.ualberta.ca \nInternational Travel \nFrom March 8-11, I travelled to Mexico to develop and deepen several valuable relationships within \nthe country. On the brief tour I met with government and industry representatives, as well as \nmembers of the Mexican academic and research community. The University of Alberta maintains \nstudent mobility agreements and research collaborations with some of Mexico’s leading \nuniversities, as well as the National Council of Science and Technology (CONACYT), the Mexican \nPetroleum Institute, and government ministries.  \nThe U of A also recently signed three “knowledge network” agreements—large-scale international \ncollaborations involving a variety of Mexican institutions and partners. The three network \nagreements are:  \n1. Reservoir and Oilfield Geomechanics for Mature Fields and Unconventional \nReservoirs \n2. Industrial Transformation and Heavy Oil Refining  \n3. Capacity Building and Talent Formation \nThrough these agreements, University of Alberta energy experts will help develop new research \nprogramming and academic training aimed at the efficient, economic and sustainable development \nof Mexico’s hydrocarbon assets. \nThese knowledge networks allow us to share our expertise as a global leader in energy and \nenvironmental scholarship.  \nCanada 150 \nCanada turns 150 this year, and the University of Alberta is engaging in the celebration. Over the \nnext year, we are proudly celebrating the people, achievements and ideas that contributed to the \nmaking of a confederation. Through stories, photos, and events, we are also recognizing the U of \nA’s many contributions to the building of our nation.  \nI invite you to follow the celebrations here. \nhttps://medium.com/ualberta2017\n6 \nOFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT  \n2-24 South Academic Building (SAB)  |  Edmonton, Alberta, Canada T6G 2G7  |  president.ualberta.ca \nCanada Foundation for Innovation Funding \nIn early March, the Government of Canada announced $2.1M in research infrastructure funding for \n14 projects at the University of Alberta. Distributed through the John R. Evans Leaders Fund, this \nmoney will be invested in state-of-the-art facilities and equipment, and will help our community to \nundertake world-class research. I am working with colleagues at Universities Canada and the U15 \nto ensure that, as Canadian institutions, we continue to capitalize on the federal government’s pro-\ninnovation and research agenda. Collectively, we are advocating for increased funding to the \ngranting councils and investment to cover the full costs of research. \nChanging Lives Week \nThe U of A celebrated its first Changing Lives Week at the end of February. The campaign \nrecognized that donor support for scholarships, awards and bursaries helps our students to \nachieve their potential, and in turn to uplift our communities. The week featured several stories of \ndonor impact with a common theme: by investing in the U of A, donors change lives. \nLeadership Transitions \nThe searches for two new vice-presidents—research and university relations—are underway. \nThroughout January and early February, we gathered feedback from the university community on \nthe priorities, current issues, and future directions of both portfolios. This feedback will assist each \ncommittee to conduct their VP search and recommend candidates. \nOn March 9, we welcomed 6 new members  to our Board of Governors. Please join me in \ncongratulating Dominique Grégoire, Lynne Paradis, Lynn Parish, Zahra Somani, Sheri Somerville, \nand Owen Tobert on their appointments. \nThank you for your continued dedication to the University of Alberta. \nYours sincerely, \nDavid H.

The review \ninvolved face-to-face meetings, a series of town halls and invitations for \nonline and email submissions from all sectors and members of the \nacademy.  The data and information gathered was reviewed by the SWS \nWorking Group and then collated into a report and recommendations to \nthe Provost.  \nFrom August to December, 2016, Drs. Rodgers and Costopoulos \nparticipated in over 25 meetings, including six town halls. The meetings \nincluded all known existing writing support units from Faculties, centres, \nand other academic units. Over 80 online submissions and 6 email \ncontributions were received and reviewed.   Regular updates on the \nprogress of the review were provided to Deans’ Council, Vice Provosts’ \nCouncil, PEC-O, Chairs’ Council and General Faculties Council. \nThe SWS Working Group achieved its overarching goal of submitting a \nreport on the current state of scholarly writing support at the UofA, and a \nseries of recommendations for the enhancement, optimization and \ncoordination of all components and dimensions of writing support \nincluding service (tutoring), teaching and research.  \nTimeline/Implementation Date The Working Group’s recommendations will be considered by the \nProvost and Vice-President (Academic), and implementation will be \nguided by that office as well.  \nSupplementary Notes and \ncontext \nAt the May 30, 2016 meeting of GFC, the Provost reported that the \nUniversity was committed to providing no-cost writing services to \nstudents and that an examination of the model including consultation \nwould occur. This issue arose on the floor of  GFC in response to a \nquestion from a member regarding the transition of services offered by \nthe Centre for Writers in the Faculty of Arts to the portfolio of the Vice-\nProvost and Dean of Students. \nEngagement and Routing (Include meeting dates) \nItem No. 7 \nGENERAL FACULTIES COUNCIL \nFor the Meeting of March 20, 2017 \n Participation: \n(parties who have seen the \nproposal and in what capacity) \n<For further information see \nthe link posted on \nthe Governance Toolkit section \nStudent Participation Protocol> \nThose who have been informed: \n• VPC (regular updates), PEC-O (regular updates), PACD June 16, \n2016, Deans’ Council (regular updates) \n• GFC Executive Committee March 6, 2017 \n• GFC March 20, 2017 \nThose who have been consulted: \n• See Appendix 1 (SWS Workplan 2016-17) of final report \nThose who are actively participating: \nSWS Working Group Membership:  \n(SWS Working Group Terms of Reference-Attachment) \n• Deputy Provost (Co-Chair) (Wendy Rodgers) \n• Vice-Provost and Dean of Students (Co-Chair) (André \nCostopoulos) \n• One Dean, as selected by the Provost (John Nychka, Associate \nDean FGSR)  \n• One Undergraduate Student Representative (Marina Banister, \nVice-President Academic, SU) \n• One Graduate Student Representative (Ali Talaei, Vice-\nPresident Student Services, GSA) \n• One CAST Member (Roy Jensen, Sessional Lecturer, \nDepartment of Chemistry) \n• Two Faculty Members (Karsten Mundel, Associate Dean, \nAcademic, Augustana Faculty; Janice Causgrove Dunn, \nAssociate Dean, Undergraduate, Physical Education and \nRecreation) \n• See attached Online Responses (Attachment 2) \nAlignment/Compliance \nAlignment with Guiding \nDocuments \nFor the Public Good:  \nEngage communities across our campuses, city and region, province, \nnation and the world to create reciprocal, mutually beneficial learning \nexperiences, research projects, partnerships, and collaborations. \nSustain our people, our work, and the environment by attracting and \nstewarding resources we need to deliver excellence to the benefit of all \nAlbertans. \nCompliance with Legislation, \nPolicy and/or Procedure \nRelevant to the Proposal \n(please quote legislation and \ninclude identifying section \nnumbers) \n1.

PREAMBLE  \nThe University of Alberta (U of A) recognizes that academic writing is fundamental  to academic \nsuccess, career success, and citizenship. The U of A community needs well coordinated writing \nsupports that are accessible, learner centred, relevant, discipline-based, responsive to diverse \nlearner needs and collaborative. These supports will ensure that our community is future ready \nand has long term success. These supports should work together and should work in a manner \nrespectful of diverse scholarly approaches. \n1.Scholarly Writing Supports Review Process  \nFollowing a GFC discussion in May 2016, a decision was made to engage in a review of \nScholarly Writing Supports across the U of A.  The review was led by Dr. Wendy Rodgers, \nDeputy Provost, and Dr. Andre Costopoulos, Vice Provost and Dean of Students.  The review \nconsisted of face to face meetings and town halls and invitations for online and email \nsubmissions.  The data were then reviewed by a small working group and collated into an initial \nreport.  \nFrom August to December 2016, Drs. Rodgers and Costopoulos participated in over 25 \nmeetings, including two town halls. The meetings included all known existing writing support \nunits from Faculties, centres, and other academic units listed in Appendix 1 (SWS Working \nGroup Workplan - 2016-17). Over 80 online submissions and 6 email contributions were \nreceived and carefully reviewed.   Regular updates on the progress of the review were provided \nto Deans’ Council, Vice Provosts’ Council,  Chairs’ Council, and General Faculties Council. \n2. Objectives \nThe overarching goals of the process are to report to the Provost and Vice-President \n(Academic) on the current landscape of scholarly writing support at the U of A and to make \nrecommendations for the enhancement, optimization and coordination of all components and \ndimensions of writing support including service (tutoring), teaching and research.   \nIt is key that a full spectrum of Scholarly Writing Supports be available to the University \ncommunity. The process is not intended to eliminate any writing supports or to reduce overall \ncentral funding associated with writing initiatives across the University; there is no intention to \nreduce the academic strength or underpinnings of any writing supports; there is no intention to \nmake support units compete with each other for funding or for clientele; there is no intention to \nmandate staffing requirements, delivery modalities, or other characteristics of supports provided \nby specific units; and there is no intention to impose a full fee or cost recovery model for all \nsupports.  There is also no intention to preserve only rudimentary or corrective writing and \nediting services.  \n3. SWS Working Group and Initial Report \nThe SWS Working Group was composed in December 2016 with representatives from the \nStudents’ Union, the Graduate Students’ Association, the Faculty of Graduate Studies and \nResearch, a Contract Academic Staff: Teaching (CAST) instructor, and Associate Deans \n(Academic) from two Faculties.  This group was not intended to be representative of \n2 \nconstituency groups; rather, each member was chosen for their arm's-length perspectives, and \nknowledge on relevant issues across the University.  \nAll notes, observations, and submissions from the online consultation process were reviewed by \nthe SWS Working Group. The working group, upon thorough consideration of all this information \nand feedback, developed a set of principles on which to base their recommendations, which are \nreported here. \n4. Preliminary Findings and Actions \nOne of the key findings of the consultation process was a general lack of awareness of the full \nrange, number, and quality of different kinds of writing supports across the University.  Toward \nthat end, an early decision was made to re-develop a digital hub that will connect users to \nappropriate writing supports. This work has already begun.   \nA second key finding was a lack of awareness that all scholarly writing supports currently \navailable at the U of A are staffed by fully qualified and fully trained instructors and tutors, many \nwith very high level credentials and specialized professional accreditations.   \nSome of the other key messages the consultation feedback made clear included a need for a \nbroader range of services and supports, the importance of maintaining a strong academic focus, \na need to strengthen and broaden opportunities for scholarship and for training at all levels of \nparticipation (from students to professors).  Finally the need for some centralized oversight and \ncoordination was voiced by a large majority of those consulted. \nB. DEFINITION OF SWS \nWriting at the University must consider issues of teaching, service delivery, support provision, \nresearch, as well as the scholarly aspects of the teaching, learning, researching, and the \ntraining of instructors.  Not all supports need to address all of these considerations; however, \nthe system of supports across the University as a whole should address all these \nconsiderations.  \nThe SWS Working Group defines scholarly writing supports as: \n● Formal centres serving the University with financial support of a Dean, Vice Provost, \nChair, and/or the Provost \n● A spectrum of initiatives run out of Faculties with the financial support of a Dean or Chair \n(non-credit offerings, boot camps, writing clinics etc.) \n● Academic offerings in the form of courses which are under the authority of Faculty \nCouncils with oversight from the General Faculties Council (GFC) \nSWS at the University of Alberta serve different audiences including students and faculty. The \nadministrative authority is also diverse and may include the Provost, Deans, Faculty Councils, \nor GFC.  \nA comprehensive list of SWS can be found on the writing.ualberta.ca site (currently under \nconstruction).  \nhttp://writing.ualberta.ca/\n3 \nREPORT FROM THE SWS WORKING GROUP \nIn developing recommendations to achieve the needs described above, the Scholarly Writing \nSupports Working Group used several foundational principles to describe the qualities of writing \nsupport: \n1.Principle: Accessible  \nWriting supports should:  \n● Be affordable to users \n● Be offered in multiple locations  \n● Include robust online supports or options \n● Utilize multiple modalities \n● Have high visibility (high community awareness) \n● Provide choice of multiple learning environments \n● Provide choice of multiple delivery methods \n2. Principle: Learner-centered \nWriting supports should focus on learning as a key outcome (as appropriate). Being learner-\ncentred comprises:  \n● Active involvement of learners and educators in the development and delivery of \nsupports \n● Provision of a range of supports suitable to diverse learner stages and goals \n● Appropriate preparation of instructors of all kinds \n● Establishing pathways to instructor or tutor status for those who are interested \n3. Principle: Relevant \nWriting supports should be relevant to learners and to program learning outcomes. Writing \nsupports should relate to current pedagogies and reflect best practices in teaching and \nresearch, or in service provision, where appropriate. Relevance of writing supports comprises \nthe following ideas: \n● Should align with each other and with current pedagogy, best practices, and research \nevidence, as well as Faculty or unit goals and learner needs \n● Should be current and innovative  \n● Should develop transferable skills that will contribute to success in academia, careers, \nand society, and ensure learners are “future ready”  \n● Should include high quality of training for instructors/tutors/professional staff \n● Should use evidenced-based evaluation of quality \n4. Principle: Discipline Based  \nWriting supports need to relate to pedagogical goals and pathways of specific disciplines. The \nspectrum of supports across the University should include a range of activities or opportunities \nto support different kinds of writing such as technical reports, laboratory reports, literary pieces, \ncritical reviews, essays, thesis writing, etc.  Disciplinary attributes include: \n● Context specificity \n● Audience appropriateness  \n4 \n● Credibility of instruction  \n● Integration of instruction or collaboration with disciplinary activities  \n5. Principle: Responsive to Diverse Learner Needs  \nWriting supports are sought out by individual learners and groups of learners under different \ncircumstances.  The range of supports available should (differentially) respond to circumstances \nsuch as urgency, specificity, breadth and depth of need. There should be mechanisms for \nreviews of services to assess learner responsiveness. Being responsive should take into \nconsideration:  \n● Timeliness \n● Purpose of the writing  \n● Topic of the writing \n● Environment and method of delivery:  \n○ Delivery environments might include: credit/non-credit courses (stand-alone or \nintegrated into the curriculum); workshops; drop-in sessions; fee-for-service \nediting; bootcamps; etc. \n○ Delivery methods might include:  one-on-one tutoring or coaching from peers or \nprofessionals; large group classes; seminar-type sessions; delayed editing and \nfeedback; real-time editing and feedback; on-line tutorials; study-hall sessions; \netc. \n6. Principle: Collaborative \nWriting supports across the University need to be collaborative. Support providers and \nassociated staff, including professors, tutors, and professional coaches, must work together to \nensure a spectrum of coordinated supports are available, and to support ongoing strength of an \nentire system. Collaboration should include the following: \n● Coordination of relevant disciplinary knowledge  \n● Demonstrated respect for different perspectives and methods \n● Referring users to alternative supports to better meet their needs  \n● Contributing to the community of writing at the University in meaningful ways  \n7. Principle: Centrally Coordinated \nThe Office of the Provost, including the Vice-Provost and Dean of Students and the Vice-\nProvost and Dean of FGSR, have an important role to play in supports across the University. \nThey have particular insights into the needs and opportunities for the full spectrum of \nundergraduate and graduate students.  Through outreach and support of Deans and Faculties \nin their work to provide writing supports, the Office of the Provost can help to ensure the \nparticipation of relevant disciplinary leaders in the development and delivery of writing supports \nin alignment with the principles listed above. Finally, together with the Deans of Students and \nFGSR, the Office of the Provost can contribute and coordinate funding and funding distribution \nto writing supports across the University in fair and equitable ways, and can ensure \naccountability.  Central coordination should include:  \n● Creating communications systems across the University  \n● Creating a coordinating body to support ongoing consideration and application of these \nSWS principles  \n● Coordination and allocation of funding \n● Fairness and equity in allocation of funds as well as in remuneration of tutors and \n5 \ninstructors \n8. Principle: Funding & Sustainability  \nAccepting the principle that writing supports should be accessible to all, it must also be \nacknowledged that even if they are provided with no fee to the user, the provision of supports is \nnot “free”.  A determination of which supports should be subsidized and offered without a fee \nand which should be cost-recovery needs to be made.  Overall, the spectrum of writing supports \nmust be sustainable with costs recovered when appropriate and when possible, but should, in \ngeneral, not aspire to be revenue generating. In addition, supports must be sustainable, \nincluding the training of staff and tutors. Consideration of sustainability includes the following:  \n● What should be free to the user? \n● What should be cost-recovery?  \n● What do students need most/least?  \n● How should central funding be allocated?  \n● What succession plans are in place to sustain each writing support?  \n● What training processes and paths to ‘tutor’ positions are in place to ensure sustainable \naccess to these positions and a sustainable supply of tutors to writing supports? \n● How are the principles of equity and quality applied to the allocation of funding and other \nresources? \n● Generally, for cost recovery, costs should start low as possible, and should increase with \nincreased use of supports or with increased depth of service  \n● Funding should be sustainable across the system - permitting some supports to be \nconsistently free to the user and others to have associated fees \n6 \nRECOMMENDATIONS: The Scholarly Writing Supports Working Group offers the following \nrecommendations to enhance, optimize and coordinate writing supports in all of its components \nand dimensions across the institution:  \n1. A better communication strategy is needed to ensure the University community is aware of \nthe entire range of writing supports available.  Therefore, the digital hub is being re-developed to \nbetter represent the writing community and to describe all Scholarly Writing Supports. \n2. The University Writing Committee (UWC) should be re-invigorated with a stronger terms \nof reference and a mandate to provide advice to the Provost on SWS. The following actions will \nequip UWC to support the Provost: \n● UWC should have a specific and formal reporting structure through to the Office of the \nProvost and be chaired by a Provost’s Representative \n● UWC`s mandate should include the review of existing supports taking into account \nfunding levels, user statistics, user satisfaction, and other indicators aligned with the \nprinciples listed above  \n● UWC should have the mandate to advise the Provost on standards, protocols, and \nperformance measures around scholarly writing support  \n● UWC membership should be reviewed and guidelines established for a composition that \nwill  include representation from people associated with the supports balanced with \nequal numbers of people not specifically affiliated with supports \n● UWC should be consultative \n● UWC may provide advice to a Dean or any other internal stakeholder or centre  \n● UWC should work to forge relationships among stakeholders involved in writing supports \nto build a sense of community and to encourage coordination \n3. SWS should be coordinated centrally and together with the Office of the Provost monitor \nthe principles set out in this report in order to ensure scholarly writing support is accessible \n● Current services and supports should be reviewed by UWC as stated above, with a goal \nof ensuring the principles proposed here are equitably and fairly applied to all existing \nsupports. Where applicable, new supports for writing could be established according to \nthe principles set out in this report. \n● The intent is that the range of supports should be advised by UWC such that sessions \nare regularly available in all the various physical areas of the University at predictable \ntimes and places. Spaces should be available where members of the community can \nwork on their writing projects, support each other, and have access to a range of \nsupports. It is recognized that not all supports can be available at all times.  \n● Broader integration of writing supports into curricula is recommended.  The Scholarly \nWriting Supports Working Group recommends expanding the mandate of Writing Across \nthe Curriculum (WAC), such that it can support faculty members to include disciplinary \nspecific writing into the curriculum, to be coordinated at the program (or unit) level.  A \nrecognition system could be built by Faculties and Units (e.g., Departments) to \nencourage and recognize individual faculty members and units for including efficient and \neffective writing assignments appropriately across their courses.  \n● The Scholarly Writing Supports Working Group recommends the development of writing \ncertificates. These might be considered first at the graduate level, and might also build \nupon the WAC activities to develop discipline specific certificates that emphasize either \n7 \nwriting capabilities in particular domains (e.g., scientific writing), or writing tutoring (e.g., \nthrough a combination of courses, directed study or research experiences, and \nevaluated practical experiences). \nRECOMMENDATIONS: ADMINISTRATIVE AND OPERATIONAL STRUCTURE OF \nSCHOLARLY WRITING SUPPORTS  \nThe SWS Working Group looked specifically at the administrative and operational structure of \nscholarly writing supports and recommends that the following principles be followed: \n1. Each SWS must have an administrative “home” in an academic unit (a Faculty or other unit \nwithin the Vice-President (Academic) portfolio). This “home” should be determined by the \nsources of funding and/or, if applicable, through an agreement between a Dean(s) or other \nheads of Academic Units and the Provost. \n2. Each SWS must have a defined Terms of Reference and Mandate that respects the context \nof other SWS. The authority to approve the mandate of a SWS rests with the Dean and/or \nAcademic Unit Head and Provost, including plans for staffing, staff training, type of supports to \nbe provided, nature of teaching, learning, or research focus and necessity to collaborate with \nother units (e.g., CTL, WAC, REO, RSO, etc). Advice on the mandate and the type of supports \nto be provided should be sought from UWC who will work to maintain a balance of supports \nacross the institution and integrity of principles listed here. \n3. Each SWS should have a sustainability plan explicitly defining the associated costs of the \nSWS to the administrative unit noting whether they have off-setting funding sources. Any plans \nfor fees-for-service or cost recovery SWS should be made explicit. The sustainability plan \nshould be approved by a Dean, Academic Administrator, and/or Provost.  The Dean and/or \nProvost may seek advice from UWC on sustainability including proposed SWS fee structures, if \napplicable. \n4. Each SWS should provide an annual report on usage, costs, innovations, etc. to the UWC \nwho will review the reports and provide advice to the Provost. UWC can make strategic or \nsystem wide recommendations to the Provost for each SWS. \n5.The Dean, Unit Administrative Head, and/or Provost holds final authority for administrative \ndecisions regarding SWS including creation, movement, or dissolution of SWS. While authority \nrests with the Provost and/or Dean to make the administrative decisions, advice may be sought \nfrom a variety of stakeholders including the UWC. \n8 \nAPPENDIX 1: SWS Working Group Workplan - 2016-17 \nAPPENDIX 1: SWS Working Group Workplan - 2016-17 \nDate Tasks Notes \nGFC May 30, 2016 – Question Period \nAugust 2016                                                                                                                          PHASE 1 –Aug – Dec \n2016 \n10 Organizing meeting W.

Purpose, Goals, and Outcomes  \nPurpose:  \nDuring Question Period at the May 30, 2016 General Faculties Council meeting, discussion occurred with \nrespect to scholarly writing support across the institution.  In response to this discussion, the Provost \nrequested wider institutional consultation on, and assessment of, the state of scholarly writing support across \nthe Institution. It was clear from discussion at GFC that a number of groups deliver scholarly writing support \nacross University campuses; the lack of communication and coordination between these providers was also \nclear in discussion at GFC. In September and December 2016, Deputy Provost, Wendy Rodgers, and Vice-\nProvost and Dean of Students, André Costopoulos, have engaged in consultation to identify supports already \nin place at University campuses, where they are located, how they are resourced, and how and by whom they \nare managed. They have examined types of support and services provided, have met with the constituent \ngroups utilizing and providing these supports and services, and have inquired regarding any gaps in available \nactivities. \nGoal: \nThe overarching goal of the Working Group will be to report to the Provost and Vice-President (Academic) \non the landscape of scholarly writing support at the University and to make recommendations for the \nenhancement, optimization and coordination of writing support across the institution in all of its components \nand dimensions - service (tutoring), teaching, and research.  \nPlan and Outcomes:  \n The Working Group will collate, evaluate and assess information and comments gathered from the \nreview, and will consider creation of an online “hub” of scholarly writing support activities on the \nUniversity of Alberta website \n Emerging themes, trends and characteristics will be identified and the Working Group will summarize \nand make recommendations to the Provost and Vice-President (Academic) in the form of a final report in \nFebruary 2017, which would be presented at the March or April 2017 GFC meeting.  \n2. Membership \nDeputy Provost (Co-Chair) \nVice-Provost and Dean of Students (Co-Chair)  \nOne Dean, as selected by the Provost \nOne Undergraduate Student Representative  \nOne Graduate Student Representative  \nOne CAST Member \nTwo Faculty Members \nResource personnel will attend at the invitation of the Co-Chairs.  \n3. Meetings \nThe Working Group will begin meetings in January 2017.  Meeting frequency and schedule will be at the \ndirection of the Co-Chairs. The Working Group will be coordinated by the Office of the Provost and \nVice-President (Academic).  \nU:\\AD02\\Scholarly Writing Support Working Group\\WorkingGroup\\ScholarlyWritingSupport-WorkingGroup-TermsofReference-16Dec2016.docx \ncindyw\nTypewritten Text\nATTACHMENT 2\nScholarly Writing Support Initiatives at the University of Alberta \nSummary of Comments \nOnline Consultation Form: \n- 35 Tenured faculty members \n- 14 Non-tenured faculty members \n- 12 Students \n- 6 Other (grad students who instruct) \n- 7 Admin/Support Staff \nWhat are the challenges/opportunities with respect to scholarly writing support \nacross the institution? \n- Increased visibility of supports to increase awareness (11) \n- The challenges of International/EAL Students (10) \n- Augustana Writing Centre (9) \n- Writing support for faculty members (7) \n- Scientific/technical writing (7) \n- Relevance of writing as an essential communication skill (7) \n- Lack of capacity to meet demand at C4W (6) \n- Quality of instruction/approaches to writing support (5) \n- Student engagement (4) \n- Academic integrity (4) \n- Class sizes in English/Writing courses (3) \n- Equitable access to services across Campuses (2) \n- Admission criteria (2) \n- Research done by C4W (1) \n- Lack of coordination for writing supports (1) \n- Cost-recovery writing courses (1) \n- Certificate in writing (1) \nSuggestions/First Steps \n- Online portal for existing writing supports which is branded, visible, and which contains \nfree, self-help writing resources (18) \n-  “Hard” funding for Augustana writing, permanent body,(tenure-track) staff (11) \n- Targeted supports for International and EAL students (10) \n- Support C4W with more resources (9) \n- The need to examine existing writing course offerings, ensure smaller class sizes (9) \n- The need for writing or editing support to be free (7) \n- Arguments for scaffolded writing training integrated as compulsory components to \nundergraduate degrees (6) \n- Faculty-based supports which are tailored and proactive (6) \n- The utility of a gap analysis to examine writing supports (5) \nATTACHMENT 3\n- Keep C4W under academic leadership (4) \n- Scientific/technical writing course equivalent to English requirement (4) \n- Centralize writing supports / disbursement of funds (3) \n- Support Student Success Centre with more resources (3) \n- Address the precarious working conditions of the CAST instructors of English (2) \n- Examine admissions standards for both domestic and International students (2) \n- Keep English courses in the BA core (2) \n- Extra TA support for writing courses (2) \n- Use of software to support editing or plagiarism software (turnitin.com) (2) \n- Peer support services (1) \n- Bring decision making to University Governance (1) \n- Create a one-stop-shop for writing in the library (1) \n- Keep service for editing/high quality review cost-recovery (1) \n- Add writing support module to all eClass sections (1) \nMinute 13 - GFC May 30, 2016 - Centre for Writers - Excerpted \nThere were no documents.  \nPresenter: Steven Dew, Provost and Vice-President (Academic)  \nPurpose of the Proposal: To discuss the Centre for Writers.  \nDiscussion:  \nDr Dew reported that the plan to transition the Centre for Writers from the Faculty of Arts to the \nportfolio of the Vice-Provost and Dean of Students has been deferred to further examine the \nmodel and provide for greater consultation.  \nIn addition to comments on student participation in the consultation process, a member expressed \nconcern surrounding the sudden discontinuation of an academic unit without input from GFC. \nOn this point, Dr Dew clarified that the Centre for Writers was created as an administrative unit. \nDr Dew further indicated that writing services are provided across campus to students and that \nthe University was committed to continuing to provide no-cost service to students.  \nA member suggested inviting Dr Luci Moussu and Dr Betsy Sargent to the table to speak about \nthe impact of this decision.

The Policy suite includes key definitions to educate all \nmembers of the university community.   Fundamental principles \nestablished in the policy suite include the importance of believing \nsurvivors when they disclose an experience of sexual violence and \nproviding support, accommodations, interim measures, and information \non filing a formal complaint.  \nIn addition, the proposed policy indicates “The University takes seriously \nits responsibility to reduce sexual violence by fostering a culture of \nconsent and support through education, training and policy.”  The impact \nwill be an increasingly educated and informed community that can better \nhandle disclosures and complaints of sexual violence. \nThe Government of Alberta has made it clear that they expect every \ninstitution to produce a stand-alone policy on sexual violence.  \nReplaces/Revises (eg, policies, \nresolutions) \nN/A \nTimeline/Implementation Date Upon final approval \nEstimated Cost and funding \nsource \nN/A \nNext Steps (ie.: \nCommunications Plan, \nImplementation plans) \nThe University’s central Marketing and Communications office will \ndevelop and execute a communications strategy to inform the campus \nand broader communities.

Overview \na.  Sexual violence is a complex and serious problem in society and on university campuses. Sexual \nviolence can affect individuals of all gender identities, gender expressions, and sexual orientations, as \nwell as those from all ages, abilities, racial, cultural and economic backgrounds. \nb. The University recognizes the harm caused by a culture in which common attitudes, norms and practices \ntolerate, normalize, trivialize, excuse or outright condone sexual violence. Sometimes called rape culture, \nit is perpetuated through images, television, music, jokes, advertising, jargon, words and figures of \nspeech that normalize sexual coercion and shift blame onto those who have experienced sexual violence. \nAs an institution that exists in the context of that culture, the University takes seriously its responsibility to \nreduce sexual violence by fostering a culture of consent and support through education, training and \npolicy. \nc. This policy is guided by the following principles: \ni. the need for safety in the work, study and student residence environment, providing a community \nin which sexual violence is not tolerated, \nii. the inherent dignity of all members of the University community, \niii. the importance of fostering a culture of consent and support through education, training and \npolicy initiatives, \niv. the need to identify and dismantle barriers to making a disclosure and/or complaint,  \nv. access to support for anyone in the University community who discloses that they have \nexperienced or been affected by sexual violence, and \nvi. procedural fairness and support for the parties to formal complaint processes related to sexual \nviolence. \n2. Purpose \nThe purpose of this policy is to state the University’s commitment to addressing sexual violence through \neducation and awareness, providing access to comprehensive support for those who have experienced or \nbeen affected by sexual violence and implementing transparent and fair processes to resolve and adjudicate \ncomplaints of sexual violence. \n  U of A Policies and Procedures On-Line (UAPPOL) \n3. POLICY \na.  It is the policy of the University of Alberta that sexual violence committed by any member of the University \ncommunity is prohibited and constitutes misconduct. Prohibited conduct includes: sexual violence, sexual \nassault, sexual harassment, stalking, indecent exposure, voyeurism, and distribution of intimate \nimages.  \nb. Any member of the University community who discloses having experienced sexual violence will have \naccess to support, whether or not the sexual violence took place on University property or in relation to \nUniversity activities. Where the University has jurisdiction, complaints will be addressed under the \napplicable policies or procedures, including, for example, the Code of Student Behaviour, the \nPostdoctoral Fellow Policy, NASA, AASUA or GSA collective agreements, or other applicable \nemployment contracts and agreements. \n4. COMMITMENT TO THOSE WHO HAVE EXPERIENCED SEXUAL VIOLENCE \na. Sexual violence can have serious and enduring negative effects on physical, mental, emotional and \nspiritual health and wellness. The University recognizes the possible effects of trauma on those who have \nexperienced sexual violence and supports the efforts of individuals to seek support and recover. \nRegardless of where or when it took place, any person who discloses and/or makes a complaint of sexual \nviolence can expect to be: \ni. treated with respect, dignity and compassion, \nii. informed about on- and off-campus resources and supports, \niii. provided with access to support which is non-judgmental, coordinated and comprehensive  \niv. offered options for academic, recreational, University residence and/or workplace modifications \nto prevent further unwanted contact with the subject of the disclosure and ameliorate, to the \nextent possible, the negative impacts of the sexual violence on the person’s working, study or \nstudent residence environment, \nv. provided with information about available complaint processes should they wish to pursue a \ncomplaint within the University and/or to an external law enforcement agency, and  \nvi. offered safety planning assistance. \nb. Subject to the limitations set out in section 6 of this policy, those who experience sexual violence will be \nconsidered the primary decision-maker in matters pertaining to themselves. As such, they can determine \nwhether, to whom and what to disclose, and whether to make a complaint within the University and/or an \nexternal law enforcement agency. \n5. RESPONSIBILITIES \na. The University recognizes its institutional responsibility to: \ni. provide an effective policy and procedures to address and prevent sexual violence, \nii. raise awareness about the policy and procedures and relevant support services on campus \nthrough institution-wide education, \niii. raise awareness of consent, sexual violence, prevention, and appropriate responses to \ndisclosures of sexual violence through institution-wide education, \niv. balance the duty to ensure procedural fairness for any person accused of sexual violence with \nsupport and fairness for the complainant within the University’s complaint processes,  \nv. maintaining safe and neutral mechanisms for individuals to disclose or make a complaint of \nsexual violence, \nvi. ensuring the safety of the working, learning and student residence environment by various \nmeans, including the imposition of interim measures, where appropriate, \nvii. provide coordinated and comprehensive supports for those who disclose sexual violence, and \nviii. ensure that all individuals investigating or adjudicating complaints of sexual violence in any \nUniversity complaints process have appropriate training. \nb. All senior leaders, including the President, Vice-Presidents, Deans, Directors and Chairs and other \nofficers of the University exercise administrative responsibility to implement this policy and the related \nprocedures within their respective areas of responsibility, including by creating, supporting and \n  U of A Policies and Procedures On-Line (UAPPOL) \nmaintaining a work, study and student residence environment that promotes a culture of consent, free \nfrom sexual violence. \nc. All members of the University community are responsible for promoting respect and dignity for each other \nby encouraging a culture of consent; and for contributing to work, study and student residence \nenvironments in which individuals can disclose experiences of sexual violence without fear of disbelief, \ndisrespect or reprisal. \n6. PRIVACY AND CONFIDENTIALITY \na. Privacy and confidentiality are essential for creating an environment where those who have experienced \nsexual violence feel safe in disclosing their experience and seeking support. However, it is important to note \nthat there may be limits to the University’s ability to maintain privacy and confidentiality in some cases, \nincluding where: \ni. there is a likely risk of harm to self or others, or \nii. reporting or action is required or authorized by law or University policy. \nb. Whether or not the University can maintain the privacy and confidentiality of a disclosure will be determined \non a case by case basis, in consultation with relevant University officials. \nc. In relation to complaints, all University complaint processes are confidential. In any complaint process, \nsufficient information, including the identity of the complainant, must and will be disclosed to the accused in \norder to meet the requirements of procedural fairness.  \nd. Whether in the context of a disclosure or a complaint, all parties will be informed of the limits of privacy and \nconfidentiality. In cases where confidentiality cannot be maintained, those affected will be informed and \nsupported throughout the process. In such cases, only necessary information will be disclosed, and only to \nthose with a need to know.  \n7. STATEMENT AGAINST RETALIATION \nRetaliation against any person involved in a disclosure or complaint of sexual violence is prohibited. Where it \nhas jurisdiction, the University will investigate all reports of retaliation in accordance with the appropriate \ncomplaints processes. \n8. BAD FAITH COMPLAINTS \nThe University recognizes the serious nature of complaints made under this policy, and may take disciplinary \naction where allegations of sexual violence are shown to be malicious, fraudulent, and/or vexatious. A \ncomplaint made in good faith is not a violation of this policy even if it is not proven in a complaint process. \n9.

Inducing intoxication, impairment or incapacity for the purpose \nof making another person vulnerable to non-consensual sexual \nactivity. \nh. Other analogous conduct. \nConsent Consent is a voluntary, ongoing, active and conscious agreement to \nengage in the sexual activity in question. Consent or a “yes” that is \nobtained through pressure, coercion, force, threats or by inducing \nintoxication, impairment or incapacity is not voluntary consent. Silence \n  U of A Policies and Procedures On-Line (UAPPOL) \nor ambiguity do not constitute consent. \nAdditionally, there is no consent when: \n it is given by someone else. \n the person is unconscious, sleeping, highly intoxicated or high, \nor otherwise lacks the capacity to consent. \n it was obtained through the abuse of a position of power, trust \nor authority. \n the person does not signify “yes”, says “no” or implies “no” \nthrough words or behaviours. \n the person changes their mind and withdraws their consent. \nConsent cannot be implied (for example, by a current or past \nrelationship, by consent to another activity, or by failure to say “no” or \nresist). In addition, consent cannot be given in advance of sexual \nactivity that is expected to occur at a later time. It is the responsibility of \nthe person wanting to engage in sexual activity to obtain clear consent \nfrom the other and to recognize that consent can be withdrawn at any \ntime. \nDisclose/Disclosure A verbal or written report or account by any person to a member of the \nUniversity community that they have experienced sexual violence. \nComplaint Usually a written report or statement alleging sexual violence \nmisconduct made to a University official under a University process for \nthe purpose of initiating an investigation and resolution process. \nModifications Adjustments the University may be able to make at the request of a \nperson who has made a disclosure or complaint of sexual violence. \nThe modifications may relate to their academic program, employment, \nUniversity residence or recreational or other programs. \nInterim measures Non-disciplinary conditions that the University may impose on a person \nalleged to have committed sexual violence. Such conditions may be \nimposed in response to a disclosure or complaint. The purposes of \ninterim measures are to ensure the safety of the person who disclosed \nor of the University’s learning, working and University residence \nenvironment, to discourage or prevent retaliation, prevent further \nsexual violence and/or preserve the University’s ability to conduct a \nthorough investigation. They are not considered sanctions under any \nUniversity complaint process and in any complaint process, are without \nprejudice to the person against whom a complaint is made.  \nRetaliation Taking, attempting to take or threatening to take any adverse action or \nretribution of any kind against anyone involved in a sexual violence \nprocess including the person who made a disclosure or complaint, and \nanyone involved in an investigation or resolution of an allegation of \nsexual violence, or friends or family members of the same.  \nRetaliation can take many forms, including threats, intimidation, \npressuring, harassment, continued abuse, violence or other forms or \nthreats of harm to others, and in varying modes, including in person \nand in electronic communication or through third parties.

PURPOSE \nThe purpose of this procedure is to \n provide guidance to members of the University community on receiving and responding to disclosures of \nsexual violence, \n outline supports, modifications and protections the University may be able to offer to persons who have \nexperienced sexual violence,  \n provide authority for the imposition of interim measures to ensure the safety of the working, learning and \nUniversity residence environment,  \n describe the procedures through which complaints of sexual violence will be addressed and, where \nwarranted, discipline imposed, and  \n address education and training in, and awareness of, sexual violence for the University community \ngenerally and, in particular, for those investigating and adjudicating complaints of sexual violence.  \nPROCEDURE \nThe University’s response to a disclosure will, to the extent possible, be guided by the wishes of the person who \nexperienced the sexual violence. In this regard, in response to a disclosure, the person who experienced sexual \n  U of A Policies and Procedures On-Line (UAPPOL) \nviolence can ask the University to provide supports and resources, facilitate academic, residential, recreation \nand/or work modifications, consider the imposition of interim measures, and initiate an investigation of a complaint \nin accordance with the procedures in applicable agreements or policies. \n3. INTERIM MEASURES \na. Interim measures are non-disciplinary conditions that may be imposed on a person alleged to have committed \nsexual violence. The University may impose interim measures in response to either a disclosure or a \ncomplaint where the allegations would \ni. if proven, constitute sexual violence, and \nii. with regard to all of the circumstances, be a risk to an individual, the community or the integrity of any \npotential investigation. \nb. The purpose of such interim measures is to ensure personal safety, discourage or prevent retaliation, \nprevent further sexual violence, protect confidentiality, minimize disruption to the learning, working or \nUniversity Residence environment and/or preserve the University’s ability to conduct a thorough investigation. \nc. Having regard to all of the circumstances, where interim measures are imposed, they must be, appropriate \nand proportionate to the seriousness of the alleged conduct, and as minimally restrictive as possible to \nachieve their purposes. As a result, interim measures will be based on considerations including, but not \nlimited to: \ni. the reasonable wishes of the person who experienced the sexual violence,  \nii. the nature and/or severity of the alleged conduct, \niii. reasonably credible information about patterns of conduct or previous history of sexual violence or other \nmisconduct, \niv. the potential impact of the measures on the person(s), including on their academic program and/or \nemployment,  \nv. the potential impact of the measures on the learning, working or University Residence environment, \nvi. in the case of employees, in accordance with their relevant collective agreement, and \nvii. any other relevant information.  \nExamples of interim measures can be found in the University’s Sexual Violence Interim Measures Information \nDocument. \nd. The decision to impose interim measures will be made by: \ni. in the case of students, the Vice-Provost and Dean of Students, or designate. \nii. in the case of faculty and staff, the Provost and Vice-President (Academic) and/or the Associate Vice-\nPresident (Human Resources), or designate. \niii. in the case of postdoctoral fellows, the Vice-President (Research) , or designate. \nDecision makers may consult as needed in determining whether to impose interim measures and the nature \nof those measures.  \ne. In all cases, decisions on interim measures must be provided in writing and include: \ni. particulars of the measure(s), \nii. information about the right to request a reconsideration, \niii. information about relevant complaint processes, if applicable, and \niv. referrals to supports and/or services. \nf. The person(s) on whom interim measures are imposed may request a reconsideration from the decision \nmaker after sixty (60) days or such earlier time as agreed to by the decision maker. Further, at any time, on \nthe basis of new information, the decision maker may on his or her own initiative reconsider the interim \nmeasures imposed and renew, revise, or revoke any or all of the measures, or impose additional interim \nmeasures. \n  U of A Policies and Procedures On-Line (UAPPOL) \ng. Interim measures will be re-evaluated when a complaint process is concluded. \n4. PROCEDURES TO ADDRESS COMPLAINTS \na. Complaints of sexual violence will be resolved according to the procedures set out in the University’s \nagreements with the Association of Academic Staff: University of Alberta (AASUA), the Non-Academic Staff \nAssociation (NASA), the Graduate Student Assistantship Collective Agreement, the Postdoctoral Fellows \nDiscipline Procedure, the Code of Student Behaviour, the Residence Agreement, Practicum Intervention \nPolicy, and any other applicable contracts, agreements or policies. \nb. In all cases, use of the procedures at the University does not preclude a report to the appropriate law \nenforcement agency, professional governing body, or pursuing any other civil or other remedy available at \nlaw. \nStudents \nc. Complaints of sexual violence against students will be addressed using procedures outlined in one or more of \nthe following documents. When the person accused in the complaint is:  \ni. a student, the Code of Student Behaviour, \nii. a student living in a University Residence, the Breach of Residence Agreement process,  \niii. a student in a practicum placement, the Practicum Intervention Policy; \niv. a graduate student while appointed in a role as a graduate teaching assistant, graduate research \nassistant or short-term academically-related employment at the time of the offence, the Graduate Student \nAssistantship Collective Agreement. \nAs noted, students may be subject to more than one procedure and may, therefore, be subject to several \nprocedures concurrently.  \nEmployees, postdoctoral fellows and volunteers \nd. Complaints of sexual violence against employees, postdoctoral fellows and volunteers will be resolved \nthrough the following procedures. When the person accused in the complaint is:  \ni. a member of the Non Academic Staff Association (NASA), the processes outlined in the collective \nagreement between the University and NASA;  \ni.ii. or the Association of Academic Staff: University of Alberta (AASUA), the processes outlined in the \napplicable collective agreement between the University and AASUA; \nii.iii. a postdoctoral fellow, the Postdoctoral Fellows Discipline Procedure; \niii.iv. an employee under an employment contract or agreement, but not subject to the above collective \nagreements or Procedure, where no policy or procedure exists and where no procedures are specified in \nthe terms and conditions of their employment, the procedure will be determined on a case-by-case basis, \nensuring that the accused person has the right to: \n1.  an impartial decision-maker, \n2.  know the case to be met, \n3.  an opportunity to respond to the allegations in the complaint, \n4.  be accompanied by an advisor, and \n5.  a timely resolution. \nOthers \ne. When the person accused in a complaint or disclosure is not a member of the University Communityany other \nperson, the University may address the matter through means including, but not limited to, the Trespass to \nPremises Act of Alberta or the Petty Trespass Act of Alberta, reports to the appropriate law enforcement \nagency or professional governing body. \n5. COMPLAINANT RIGHTS IN COMPLAINTS PROCESS \n  U of A Policies and Procedures On-Line (UAPPOL) \na. The applicable procedures for investigating and adjudicating complaints of sexual violence are required to \nadhere to the principles of procedural fairness. Adherence to such principles is necessary to ensure that \npersons accused of sexual violence are protected by receiving a fair adjudication. At the same time, the \nprocedures for investigating and adjudicating complaints of sexual violence must also be conducted with due \nregard to their effects on the complainant. Having such regard is necessary in recognition that investigatory \nand adjudicative processes can themselves cause additional trauma to a complainant. In balancing these \nobligations, investigators and adjudicators will be mindful to conduct their functions in a way that reduces, to \nthe extent possible, the risk of additional harm to the complainant, while ensuring procedural fairness for the \nperson accused in the complaint. \nb. Without limiting the foregoing, where not already provided for in any complaints process related to sexual \nviolence at the Universitybut subject to the provisions of any applicable collective agreement, the complainant \nwill have the right to: \ni. be accompanied by a support person throughout their participation in any investigatory or disciplinary \nproceedings, \nii. be informed of, make and respond to procedural requests, \niii. make oral or written representations on their own behalf, through their support person or other \nappropriate party, regarding impact and sanction, \niv. receive a copy of the written reasons for the decision. \n6.

The University will provide education to the entire University community on sexual violence including, but not \nlimited to, policy awareness, consent and responding to disclosures.  \ni. Additional workshops will be offered for those more likely to receive disclosures. \nii. Training in bystander intervention, provided on a voluntary basis to students and staff. \nc.

Other analogous conduct. \nInterim measures Non-disciplinary conditions that the University may impose on a person \nalleged to have committed sexual violence. Such conditions may be \nimposed in response to a disclosure or complaint. The purposes of \ninterim measures are to ensure the safety of the person who disclosed \nor of the University’s learning, working and University residence \nenvironment, to discourage or prevent retaliation, prevent further \nsexual violence and/or preserve the University’s ability to conduct a \nthorough investigation. They are not considered sanctions under any \nUniversity complaint process and in any complaint process, are without \nprejudice to the person against whom a complaint is made. \nModifications Adjustments the University may be able to make at the request of a \nperson who has made a disclosure or complaint of sexual violence. \nThe modifications may relate to their academic program, employment, \nUniversity residence or recreational or other programs. \nRetaliation Taking, attempting to take or threatening to take any adverse action or \nretribution of any kind against anyone involved in a sexual violence \nprocess including the person who made a disclosure or complaint, and \nanyone involved in an investigation or resolution of an allegation of \nsexual violence, or friends or family members of the same.  \nRetaliation can take many forms, including threats, intimidation, \npressuring, harassment, continued abuse, violence or other forms or \nthreats of harm to others, and in varying modes, including in person \nand in electronic communication or through third parties.

Resources and Services Information Document     Page 1 \nMost Recent Editorial Date: November 15, 2016 \nOptions, Resources and Services  \nfor Those who have Experienced Sexual Violence Information Document \nIntroductory Note: \nThe University of Alberta respects each person's right to make their own decisions regarding their personal recovery after sexual violence. This \ndocument is intended to provide a non-exhaustive list of the various options available so that all students, staff, postdoctoral fellows and faculty \ncan assist in making appropriate referrals upon receiving a disclosure or make informed decisions for themselves after experiencing sexual \nviolence.  \nIndividual reactions to sexual violence will differ greatly, and a person's decision about how to respond to an experience of sexual violence may \nchange over time. Whether the result of a disclosure or a complaint, the University can assist with some of those responses, including providing \nacademic, work or University residence modifications, safety planning, personal support, making a complaint or other options that meet the goals \nof the Sexual Violence policy and related procedures.  \nSome may need a more comprehensive and coordinated response. The SVRT (Sexual Violence Response Team) is convened when an individual \ndiscloses that they have experienced sexual violence, and may need more than one modification to meet the goals of the Sexual Violence policy. \nIt is designed to provide access to multiple options, resources and responses without the individual having to approach each service separately.  \nIt should be understood that mediation is not appropriate for situations involving sexual violence. Mediation is a conflict resolution mechanism that \npresumes all parties have an equal role in resolving a conflict. Sexual violence is not a conflict, but a harm inflicted on another person. Mediation \nintroduces a significant risk of additional harm to the person to whom the violence was done and should never be considered an option in cases of \nsexual violence. \nWHAT ARE MY OPTIONS? \nPersonal Support | Medical Assistance | Safety | Modifications – Academic/Work/Living | Complaints | Other Resources and Services \nOptions, Resources and Services Information Document     Page 2 \nPersonal\tSupport\t\nOPTION HOW DO I DO THIS?

As one example, if a \nvictim did not scream or fight or say “no,” the assumption may be that there must have been implicit consent. These \nassumptions can be held by anyone receiving a disclosure, investigating, or adjudicating a complaint, or even by \nthose who have experienced sexual violence themselves. Education on these and other topics is designed to correct \nthese misconceptions. In addition, research on the potential effects of trauma on memory, recall and behaviour sheds \nnew light on methods for interviewing those who have experienced trauma. \nThe goals of education, bystander intervention and other training are to help those who experience sexual violence \nfeel safer in disclosing and/or making a complaint and seeking support; ensure that those who receive disclosures \nknow how to support and refer; allow investigators to use trauma-informed interview techniques in order to get the \nbest information possible from complainants; and ensure that decision-makers in complaint processes are able to \nappropriately interpret the evidence before them. Below is a non-exhaustive list of selected training and education \nopportunities. Any other relevant training should also be considered, as appropriate. \nFOR THE UNIVERSITY COMMUNITY \nThe resources below are available to members of the University community at no cost and provide education and \ntraining in the areas of understanding sexual assault, consent, bystander intervention, gender based violence, effects \nof trauma and trauma-informed interviewing.  \nSexual Assault Centre (no cost) \n Videos: Understanding Sexual Assault \nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3j3qgLRQaIw&list=PL2V1RRG3M1rTKPuhw2eHWvVlVcrBcDKsH&index\n=1  \n Online guide: How to Respond to a Disclosure of Sexual Violence https://www.ualberta.ca/current-\nstudents/sexual-assault-centre/responding \n Working for Change workshops: Email edcoord@ualberta.ca  \nthe Landing (no cost) \nThe Gender Based Violence Prevention Program (GBVPP) is a campus and community-wide initiative designed to \nincrease awareness, education, communication, inclusion and safety.

[▲Top] \nDisclose/Disclosure A verbal or written report or account by any person to a member of the \nUniversity community that they have experienced sexual violence. \nComplaint Usually a written report or statement alleging sexual violence \nmisconduct made to a University official under a University process for \nthe purpose of initiating an investigation and resolution process. \nSexual violence Any sexual act or act of a sexual nature, or act targeting sexuality, \nwhether physical or psychological, committed without consent. This \nincludes, but is not limited to the following: \na. Sexual Assault  - Any form of sexual contact without consent. \nThis can include unwanted or forced kissing, fondling, vaginal \nor anal penetration or touching, or oral sexual contact. \nEducation and Training Information Document   Page 4 \nb. Sexual Harassment - as defined in the UAPPOL \nDiscrimination, Harassment and Duty to Accommodate Policy. \nc. Stalking - Repeated unwanted contact or communication \ndirected at another person that causes reasonable fear or \nconcern for that person’s safety or the safety of others known \nto them. The harm may be physical, emotional, or \npsychological, or related to the personal safety, property, \neducation, or employment of an individual.  \nStalking can occur physically (such as watching and \nmonitoring, pursuing or following, making threatening or \nobscene gestures, sending unsolicited gifts), electronically (for \nexample, continuously commenting or contacting via social \nmedia, surveillance, letters, text messages, emails or phone \ncalls), and/or through a third party.  \nd. Indecent Exposure - Exposing one’s genitals, buttocks and/or \nbreasts or inducing another to expose their own genitals, \nbuttocks and/or breasts in non-consensual circumstances, in \nperson or electronically. \ne. Voyeurism - Surreptitiously observing and/or recording another \nindividual’s full or partial nudity or sexual activity without the \nknowledge and consent of all parties involved. \nf. Distribution of Intimate Images - Includes showing, sharing, \ndistributing or streaming of images, video or audio recording of \na sexual activity or full or partial nudity of oneself or other \nmembers of the University community, without the consent of \nall the recipient(s) and/or other member(s) of the University \ncommunity who is/are the subject of the image or recording, or \nthe threat to do the same. \ng. Inducing intoxication, impairment or incapacity for the purpose \nof making another person vulnerable to non-consensual sexual \nactivity. \nh. Other analogous conduct. \nConsent Consent is a voluntary, ongoing, active and conscious agreement to engage in the sexual activity in question. Consent or a “yes” that is \nobtained through pressure, coercion, force, threats or by inducing \nintoxication, impairment or incapacity is not voluntary consent. Silence \nor ambiguity do not constitute consent. \nAdditionally, there is no consent when: \n it is given by someone else. \n the person is unconscious, sleeping, highly intoxicated or high, \nor otherwise lacks the capacity to consent. \n it was obtained through the abuse of a position of power, trust \nor authority. \n the person does not signify “yes”, says “no” or implies “no” \nEducation and Training Information Document   Page 5 \nthrough words or behaviours. \n the person changes their mind and withdraws their consent. \nConsent cannot be implied (for example, by a current or past \nrelationship, by consent to another activity, or by failure to say “no” or \nresist). In addition, consent cannot be given in advance of sexual \nactivity that is expected to occur at a later time. It is the responsibility of \nthe person wanting to engage in sexual activity to obtain clear consent \nfrom the other and to recognize that consent can be withdrawn at any \ntime. \nComplainant An individual who makes a complaint under a University process. \nRELATED LINKS \nShould a link fail, please contact uappol@ualberta.ca.

The Scholarship of Discovery \n2. The Scholarship of Integration \n3. The Scholarship of Application / Engagement \n4. The Scholarship of Teaching and Learning \n______________________________ \nThe University of Alberta does not have an institutionally-approved single definition of \nscholarship.  The Faculty Agreement describes the responsibilities of faculty members, \nincluding teaching, research, and service, though it does not define “scholarship.” The Faculty \nAgreement also describes the authority of Faculty Evaluation Committees (FECs) to draft \nstandards of performance that reflect competence in teaching, research, and service that are \nrelevant for that Faculty and against which faculty members in that Faculty are to be evaluated.  \nAny change to the Faculty Agreement would need to be negotiated with the AASUA as part of \nthe next round of bargaining. \nCentre for Teaching and Learning Director Dr. Janice Miller-Young has offered the following \ninformation for the interest of members of GFC. Prior to joining the U of A, Dr. Miller-Young was \nthe Director of the Scholarship of Teaching and Learning unit at Mount Royal University.  She \nco-edited the special issue of the journal New Directions for Teaching and Learning to be \npublished this spring and she is the associate editor of the Canadian Journal for Scholarship of \nTeaching and Learning.     \nThis question could be answered two ways: (1) by looking at whether faculty are engaged in all \ntypes of scholarship as defined by Boyer; and (2) by looking at whether faculty are rewarded for \nall types of scholarship as defined by Boyer. \nBefore answering either question, it is useful to consider some of the more recent literature and \ndebates about Boyer’s model.  One source of confusion and debate has been that the nature of \neach of the types of scholarship were not well defined.  Most would agree that scholarship \nrequires disciplinary expertise, undergoes some form of peer review, is publicly disseminated, \nand advances knowledge.  To make criteria for evaluating less traditional forms of scholarship \nmore explicit, Glassick et al. (1997) set out to define the essential components of scholarship.  \nThey proposed the following standards for evaluation: 1. Clear goals; 2. Adequate preparation; \n3. Appropriate methods; 4. Significant results*; 5. Effective presentation; and 6. Reflective \ncritique (p. 25). \nUsing these definitions and criteria, the answer to question (1) is an unqualifiable ‘yes’.  \nScholarly activities that were (before Boyer) not considered scholarship, such as community \nengaged activities and research (scholarship of application and/or engagement), and \ndevelopment of textbooks and new courses and teaching materials (scholarship of teaching, \nlater re-named the scholarship of teaching and learning (Barr and Tagg, 1995; Hutchings et al., \n2011)), are most certainly going on across the University.  Further, our institutional goal of \nengaging with communities across our campuses, city and region, province, nation, and the \nworld to create reciprocal, mutually beneficial learning experiences, research projects, \npartnerships, and collaborations (For the Public Good) is evidence that the University \nrecognizes the benefits and indeed, obligation, of faculty to engage in a variety of scholarly \nactivities which involve and benefit our communities, in addition to conducting the ‘scholarship \nof discovery’. \nThe answer to question (2) is more complex because it depends on a number of factors \nincluding the local practices of departments, chairs, and Faculty Evaluation Committees.  \nInstitutional recognition mechanisms like the McCalla and Vargo Professorships, and the \nTeaching and Learning Enhancement Fund certainly recognize and reward faculty members for \na range of scholarly activities. In general, for large initiatives such as revamping courses and \ncurricula, faculty members often receive some reassignment of their regular workload to do the \nwork.   However, whether or not an FEC recognizes, as scholarship, those activities which are \nnot “discovery research\" likely depends on the discipline, how the project is disseminated \nbeyond the local context, and whether or not it builds on existing knowledge and/or influences \npractice. \n*not in the statistical sense, but rather “Does the scholar’s work add consequentially to the \nfield?”, and “”Does the scholar’s work open additional areas for further exploration?” \nReferences \nBarr, R.
