            "Description": "Details Responsibility Provost and Vice-President (Academic) and Vice-President (Research) The Purpose of the Proposal is (please be specific) To clarify when the staff member owns copyright, and when the University owns copyright. The Impact of the Proposal is To update and revise the language in Article 10 related to copyright in the various academic collective agreements (APO Agreement, Faculty Agreement, FSO Agreement, Librarian Agreement, CAST Agreement, SOTS Agreement, TRAS Agreement). Replaces/Revises (eg, policies, resolutions) Article 10 in the various Academic Staff Agreements. Timeline/Implementation Date July 1, 2016 Estimated Cost N/A Sources of Funding N/A Notes The rules regarding copyright created by academic staff at the University are based on two documents; the Post-Secondary Learning Act (PSLA) and the collective agreements between the Board and the AASUA.   The PSLA states: Intellectual Property 68(1) Unless otherwise agreed to by the board, the ownership of any invention, work, information or material, regardless of form, including any patent, copyright, technological or industrial design process or trademark acquired or produced by an officer of the post-secondary institution or an employee of the board that results from or is connected with the officer’s or employee’s duties or employment vests in the board and may be made available to the public under conditions, on payment of fees or royalties or otherwise, as the board may determine. The collective agreements between the Board of Governors and AASUA have contained Copyright Regulations (as Articles and/or Appendices) since 1977.  Over the years, there has been a significant amount of confusion when the parties have attempted to interpret the Copyright Regulations as it is not clear from the language when the University would own copyright and when it would be owned by the staff member.  The generally accepted practice (although not strictly based on the language) has been to acknowledge that academic staff own the copyright in their teaching materials, but the University has some sort of limited license to use that material. In 2010, the University of Alberta and the AASUA agreed to form an “Agreement Review Committee” that would examine two aspects of intellectual property: a) copyright and b) the emerging issue of intellectual property that is not covered by patent or copyright practices.  The ARC that was created has focused solely on the first issue - copyright.  This ARC has been meeting regularly since and has developed proposed new Copyright Regulations which would replace the existing regulations in their entirety.  The ARC believes that the new language creates greater certainty as it relates to copyright ownership and use.   The key elements of the proposed new Regulations include: 1.    Clear ownership by academic staff of copyright in works they create as a result of or connected with their duties or employment. 2.    An immediate, non-exclusive, royalty-free, non-transferable and irrevocable license to the University to use these works for purposes related to its approved mandate. 3.    A more limited license to the University to use a staff member’s detailed teaching materials, for example if the staff member is unable or unavailable to deliver all or part of a course assigned to that staff member during that academic year. 4.    Ownership by the University of copyright of works created by a staff member in the course of performing administrative or management duties or activities.   5.     A clear statement that a staff member’s copyright in works created as part of a sponsored research agreement is governed by the terms of that agreement.  This gives the University the right to alter copyright ownership in a sponsored research agreement, the way it is currently able to be done for Patentable Intellectual Property. *It is important to note that the proposed Regulations deal with copyright that is created by a University of Alberta academic staff member in performing his employment duties.  It does not apply to the use by the University of copyright materials from other sources (textbooks, library books, online sources, etc).  There is a separate policy suite being drafted that deals with such issues.

Post-Secondary Learning Act (PSLA):  Alberta’s Post-Secondary Learning Act (PSLA) gives the Board of Governors the authority to “develop, manage and operate, alone or in co-operation with any person or organization, programs, services and facilities for the educational or cultural advancement of the people of Alberta” (Section 60(1)).  Further, the Board of Governors “must consider the recommendations of the general faculties council, if any, on matters of academic import prior to providing for […] any other activities the board considers necessary or advantageous”  (Section 19(e)). 2.  Post-Secondary Learning Act (PSLA):  Section 26(1) states that, “[s]ubject to the authority of the board, a general faculties council is responsible for the academic affairs of the university and, without restricting the generality of the foregoing, has the authority to […] (o) make recommendations to the board with respect to affiliation with other institutions, academic planning, campus planning, a building program, the budget, the regulation of residences and dining halls, procedures in respect of appointments, promotions, salaries, tenure and dismissals, and any other matters considered by the general faculties council to be of interest to the university […].” Further, the PSLA, states in Section 31(1) that “[t]he general faculties council has general supervision of student affairs at a university […].” 3.

GFC Academic Planning Committee Terms of Reference (3. Mandate of the Committee) “The Academic Planning Committee (APC) is GFC’s senior committee dealing with academic, financial and planning issues. As such, it is not only responsible to GFC (or the Board) for the specific matters itemized below, but may also ask to consider or recommend to GFC on any academic issue, including: 1) those issues under the purview of other GFC committees, 2) any academic issue related to restructuring, 3) any research-related issue, or 4) issues linked to academic service units where those issues have a significant academic impact. In like manner, the President, Provost and Vice-President (academic) or other Vice-\nPresidents may refer any matter to APC for consideration or recommendation to GFC. APC is also responsible to GFC for promoting an optimal learning environment for students and excellence in teaching, research, and graduate studies. (GFC 29 SEP 2003)” 5. GFC Executive Committee Terms of Reference (3. Mandate of the Committee) “5.

The composition of the ARC’s membership has changed significantly over time; the Vice-President (Research) has been a member from the beginning, as has Geoffrey Rockwell (Department of Philosophy). They have provided important continuity to the discussions over the past six years. During 2010, before detailed discussions began, a review of the copyright regulations of some of the University’s peer institutions in Canada (McGill, UBC, University of Toronto) and the US (University of Wisconsin, University of Michigan, Penn State) was carried out.  This provided important context for the discussion about possible changes to the University’s copyright regulations. While significant work was done by email between meetings, the ARC met face to face on the following dates: December 20, 2010; February 16, 2011; February 28, 2011; April 1, 2011; April 26, 2011; December 19, 2011; February 14, 2012; October 26, 2012; May 14, 2013; June 19, 2013; October 28, 2013; September 5, 2014; October 17, 2014; and December 11, 2014. A significant portion of 2015 was taken up with finalizing the wording of the Copyright Regulations as well as drafting and finalizing a series of Frequently Asked Questions which will be posted on the AASUA website following the approval of the new Copyright Regulations. The Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) was signed on February 26, 2016. There will be a parallel approval process, involving both the AASUA membership as well as GFC/Board.

Over the years, there has been a significant amount of \nconfusion when the parties have attempted to interpret the Copyright \nRegulations as it is not clear from the language when the University \nwould own copyright and when it would be owned by the staff member.  \nThe generally accepted practice (although not strictly based on the \nlanguage) has been to acknowledge that academic staff own the \ncopyright in their teaching materials, but the University has some sort of \nItem No. 4 \nGFC ACADEMIC PLANNING COMMITTEE \nFor the Meeting of April 20, 2016 \nlimited license to use that material. \nIn 2010, the University of Alberta and the AASUA agreed to form an \n“Agreement Review Committee” that would examine two aspects of \nintellectual property: a) copyright and b) the emerging issue of \nintellectual property that is not covered by patent or copyright practices.  \nThe ARC that was created has focused solely on the first issue - \ncopyright.  This ARC has been meeting regularly since and has \ndeveloped proposed new Copyright Regulations which would replace the \nexisting regulations in their entirety.  The ARC believes that the new \nlanguage creates greater certainty as it relates to copyright ownership \nand use.   \nThe key elements of the proposed new Regulations include: \n1.    Clear ownership by academic staff of copyright in works they create \nas a result of or connected with their duties or employment. \n2.    An immediate, non-exclusive, royalty-free, non-transferable and \nirrevocable license to the University to use these works for purposes \nrelated to its approved mandate. \n3.    A more limited license to the University to use a staff member’s \ndetailed teaching materials, for example if the staff member is unable or \nunavailable to deliver all or part of a course assigned to that staff \nmember during that academic year. \n4.    Ownership by the University of copyright of works created by a staff \nmember in the course of performing administrative or management \nduties or activities.   \n5.     A clear statement that a staff member’s copyright in works created \nas part of a sponsored research agreement is governed by the terms of \nthat agreement.  This gives the University the right to alter copyright \nownership in a sponsored research agreement, the way it is currently \nable to be done for Patentable Intellectual Property. \n*It is important to note that the proposed Regulations deal with copyright \nthat is created by a University of Alberta academic staff member in \nperforming his employment duties.  It does not apply to the use by the \nUniversity of copyright materials from other sources (textbooks, library \nbooks, online sources, etc).  There is a separate policy suite being \ndrafted that deals with such issues. \nAlignment/Compliance \nAlignment with Guiding \nDocuments \nDare to Discover, Dare to Deliver, Comprehensive Institutional Plan,  \nacademic collective agreements \nCompliance with Legislation, \nPolicy and/or Procedure \nRelevant to the Proposal \n(please quote legislation and \ninclude identifying section \nnumbers) \n1.  Post-Secondary Learning Act (PSLA):  Alberta’s Post-Secondary \nLearning Act (PSLA) gives the Board of Governors the authority to \n“develop, manage and operate, alone or in co-operation with any person \nor organization, programs, services and facilities for the educational or \ncultural advancement of the people of Alberta” (Section 60(1)).  \nItem No. 4 \nGFC ACADEMIC PLANNING COMMITTEE \nFor the Meeting of April 20, 2016 \nFurther, the Board of Governors “must consider the recommendations of \nthe general faculties council, if any, on matters of academic import prior \nto providing for […] any other activities the board considers necessary or \nadvantageous”  (Section 19(e)). \n2.  Post-Secondary Learning Act (PSLA):  Section 26(1) states that, \n“[s]ubject to the authority of the board, a general faculties council is \nresponsible for the academic affairs of the university and, without \nrestricting the generality of the foregoing, has the authority to […] \n(o) make recommendations to the board with respect to affiliation with \nother institutions, academic planning, campus planning, a building \nprogram, the budget, the regulation of residences and dining halls, \nprocedures in respect of appointments, promotions, salaries, tenure and \ndismissals, and any other matters considered by the general faculties \ncouncil to be of interest to the university […].” \nFurther, the PSLA, states in Section 31(1) that “[t]he general faculties \ncouncil has general supervision of student affairs at a university […].” \n3. GFC Committee on the Learning Environment Terms of \nReference (3. Mandate of the Committee) \n“The Committee on the Learning Environment is responsible for making \nrecommendations concerning policy matters and action matters with \nrespect to the following: […] \nb) To review and, as necessary, recommend to the GFC Academic \nPlanning Committee or the GFC Executive Committee policies on \nteaching, learning, teaching evaluation, and recognition for teaching that \npromote the University’s Academic Plan. […] \ni) To consider any matter deemed by the GFC Committee on the \nLearning Environment to be within the purview of its general \nresponsibility.” \n4. GFC Academic Planning Committee Terms of Reference (3. \nMandate of the Committee) \n“The Academic Planning Committee (APC) is GFC’s senior committee \ndealing with academic, financial and planning issues. As such, it is not \nonly responsible to GFC (or the Board) for the specific matters itemized \nbelow, but may also ask to consider or recommend to GFC on any \nacademic issue, including: 1) those issues under the purview of other \nGFC committees, 2) any academic issue related to restructuring, 3) any \nresearch-related issue, or 4) issues linked to academic service units \nwhere those issues have a significant academic impact. In like manner, \nthe President, Provost and Vice-President (academic) or other Vice-\nPresidents may refer any matter to APC for consideration or \nrecommendation to GFC. APC is also responsible to GFC for promoting \nan optimal learning environment for students and excellence in teaching, \nresearch, and graduate studies. (GFC 29 SEP 2003)” \n5. GFC Executive Committee Terms of Reference (3. Mandate of the \nCommittee) \n“5. Agendas of General Faculties Council \nGFC has delegated to the Executive Committee the authority to decide \nwhich items are placed on a GFC Agenda, and the order in which those \nagenda items appear on each GFC agenda. […] \nItem No. 4 \nGFC ACADEMIC PLANNING COMMITTEE \nFor the Meeting of April 20, 2016 \nWhen recommendations are forwarded to General Faculties Council \nfrom APC, the role of the Executive shall be to decide the order in which \nitems should be considered by GFC. The Executive Committee is \nresponsible for providing general advice to the Chari about proposals \nbeing forwarded from APC to GFC.” \n6.  Board Learning and Discovery Committee Terms of Reference \n(3. Mandate of the Committee) \n“Except as provided in paragraph 4 hereof and in the Board’s General \nCommittee Terms of Reference, the Committee shall, in accordance with \nthe Committee’s responsibilities with powers granted under the Post-\nSecondary Learning Act, monitor, evaluate, advise and make decisions \non behalf of the Board with respect to matters concerning the teaching \nand research affairs of the University, including proposals coming from \nthe administration and from General Faculties Council (the “GFC”), and \nshall consider future educational expectations and challenges to be \nfaced by the University.  The Committee shall also include any other \nmatter delegated to the Committee by the Board. \nWithout limiting the generality of the foregoing the Committee shall: \na. review and approve initiatives related to the overall academic \nmission and related plans and policies of the University; b. review, \nprovide feedback and approve teaching and research policies[.] […]” \n7. Board Human Resources and Compensation Committee (3. \nMandate of the Committee) \n“Except as provided in paragraph 4 and in the Board’s General \nCommittee Terms of Reference, the Committee shall monitor, evaluate, \nadvise and make decisions on behalf of the Board with respect to, and \nthe Board delegates to the Committee responsibility and authority for, all \npolicies and procedures affecting staff working condition sat the \nUniversity and matters for collective bargaining and related service \ncontracts. The Committee shall also consider any other matter delegated \nto the Committee by the Board. \nWithout limiting the generality of the foregoing the Committee shall:  \n(a) consider and propose changes in collective agreements and confirm \nthe mandate for negotiating committees with all bargaining units;[…] \n(g) review and approve material changes to personnel policies of the \nUniversity that are outside the regular collective bargaining process and \nconsider trends affecting such policies;” \nRouting (Include meeting dates) \nParticipation: \n(parties who have seen the \nproposal and in what capacity) \n• Those who have been \ninformed \n• Those who have been \nconsulted \n• Those who are actively \nparticipating \nThe Agreement Review Committee (ARC) on Copyright Regulations has \nmet regularly since 2010, and both parties have also had numerous \ninternal meetings.  The composition of the ARC’s membership has \nchanged significantly over time; the Vice-President (Research) has been \na member from the beginning, as has Geoffrey Rockwell (Department of \nPhilosophy). They have provided important continuity to the discussions \nover the past six years. \nDuring 2010, before detailed discussions began, a review of the \ncopyright regulations of some of the University’s peer institutions in \nCanada (McGill, UBC, University of Toronto) and the US (University of \nItem No. 4 \nGFC ACADEMIC PLANNING COMMITTEE \nFor the Meeting of April 20, 2016 \nWisconsin, University of Michigan, Penn State) was carried out.  This \nprovided important context for the discussion about possible changes to \nthe University’s copyright regulations. \nWhile significant work was done by email between meetings, the ARC \nmet face to face on the following dates: December 20, 2010; February \n16, 2011; February 28, 2011; April 1, 2011; April 26, 2011; December \n19, 2011; February 14, 2012; October 26, 2012; May 14, 2013; June 19, \n2013; October 28, 2013; September 5, 2014; October 17, 2014; and \nDecember 11, 2014. A significant portion of 2015 was taken up with \nfinalizing the wording of the Copyright Regulations as well as drafting \nand finalizing a series of Frequently Asked Questions which will be \nposted on the AASUA website following the approval of the new \nCopyright Regulations. The Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) was \nsigned on February 26, 2016. \nThere will be a parallel approval process, involving both the AASUA \nmembership as well as GFC/Board.  The approval route noted below is \nfor GFC/Board, which is the responsibility of administration. \nApproval Route (Governance) \n(including meeting dates) \nGFC Committee on the Learning Environment (for recommendation) – \nApril 6, 2016 \nGFC Academic Planning Committee (for recommendation) – April 20, \n2016 \nGFC Executive Committee – May 16, 2016 \nGeneral Faculties Council – May 30, 2016 \nBoard Human Resources and Compensation Committee – May 31, 2016 \nBoard Learning and Discovery Committee – June 2, 2016 \nBoard of Governors – June 17, 2016 \nFinal Approver Board of Governors \nAttachments (each to be numbered 1 - <>) \n1.

Attachment 2 (page(s) 1 - 7) Frequently Asked Questions Concerning the New Copyright Regulations, \n developed by the AASUA and University administration, dated March 5, 2016 \nPrepared by: Katharine Moore, Office of the Vice-President (Research) \n   email: katharine.moore@ualberta.ca; phone x20868 \n23/03/16 \nPage 1 of 7 \nFrequently Asked Questions Concerning the New Copyright Regulations \nPlease Note: These FAQs are for the information of academic staff members, and shall not \nbe used by any party in any dispute over the interpretation of the Regulations. \n1. What prompted the creation of the Agreement Review Committee (ARC) and the \ndrafting of the new Copyright Regulations? \n When the Association of Academic Staff negotiated the patent policy with the Board of \nGovernors, it was recognized that the collective agreement provisions regarding copyright \nneeded substantial revision.  Under the Post-secondary Learning Act of Alberta, whatever rights \nstaff have as individuals to their creative work is governed by the collective agreements between \nthe AASUA and the Board. As was seen at the time of the patent review, the current language is \nquite opaque and in need of revision.  Recognizing the need for change, the Board and AASUA \nagreed to form an “Agreement Review Committee” that would examine provisions of our \ncollective agreements regarding copyright, and to review two aspects of intellectual property: \ncopyright and the emerging issue of intellectual property that is not covered by patent or \ncopyright practices. The membership of this ARC has changed over time, but both the Board and \nthe AASUA are pleased to bring forward new Copyright Regulations.  \n2. Why did this process take so long? \n Due to the membership of the ARC and various members going on sabbatical leave or \nunable to serve on the ARC due to their work responsibilities, it was difficult to schedule \nmeetings.  It also took time to deliberate on the issues and to write language that was agreeable \nto both sides. \n3. What are the key principles underlying the new Copyright Regulations?  \nFirst, the idea was to replace confusing and out of date language in the academic staff collective \nagreements with language that would provide academic staff and the Board with clear guidance \non the subject.   \nSecond, the idea was to replace language asserting that the Board owns the copyright of staff \nworks in Article 10 with language starting with the principle that staff own the copyright to their \nwork, with some exceptions, discussed below.  \nThird, we wanted to add protections to ensure that the Board would have a license to use the \nwork of staff to do its core business in certain circumstances.   \nFourth, we settled on the principle benefiting both parties that in cases where the University \nneeded ongoing access to copyrighted materials, a non-exclusive license would allow staff to do \nwhat they wanted with materials they created even if they leave the University, while still \nallowing the University to continue to use key materials for specific purposes.  \nPage 2 of 7 \n4. If we didn’t have a collective agreement, who would own copyright in works \nproduced by academic staff in the course of their duties? \nIn the absence of provisions within a collective agreement, the Board of Governors – not \nacademic staff - would own the copyright to Works that “result from” or “are connected with”, \nstaff members’ duties or employment.  Section 68 of the Post-Secondary Learning Act provides \nas follows: \n68(1)  Unless otherwise agreed to by the board, the ownership of any invention, work, \ninformation or material, regardless of form, including any patent, copyright, \ntechnological or industrial design process or trademark acquired or produced by an \nofficer of the post‑secondary institution or an employee of the board that results \nfrom or is connected with the officer’s or employee’s duties or employment vests in \nthe board and may be made available to the public under conditions, on payment of fees \nor royalties or otherwise, as the board may determine. \n(2)  The board may compensate a person described in subsection (1). \n(3)  The board may enter into an agreement with a person to whom the board has \nprovided or proposes to provide facilities, equipment or financial aid providing for the \nrespective rights, obligations and liabilities of the board and the person with respect to the \nownership of any invention, work, information or material, regardless of form, including \nany patent, copyright, technological or industrial design process or trademark acquired or \nproduced by the person while engaged in a project funded in whole or in part by the \nboard. \n5. To what creative products do the Copyright Regulations apply?  What counts as a \n“Work”? \nFor the purposes of the Copyright Regulations, a Work is any creative product respecting which \ncopyright is recognized under the Copyright Act. Very generally, copyright applies to original \nliterary, dramatic, musical or artistic works – regardless of format or technology of presentation \n(digital movies as much as handwritten plays).  Copyright also applies (for example) to \n“performers’ performances,” which would include lectures. \nThe Regulations would also apply, for example, to online course products, such as “MOOCs”.  \nKeep in mind, though, that these sorts of projects can be expensive and involve many parties.  It \nwould be very likely that intellectual property rights will be dealt with by the contract(s) that \nestablish the project (see 1.5, 5).  If a staff member chooses to enter into these sorts of contracts, \nthe terms of the contracts shall govern copyright ownership.   \nThe Copyright Regulations do not apply to creative products that are not governed by the \nCopyright Act, such as inventions that fall under the Patent Policy, industrial designs, or \ntrademarks. \nPage 3 of 7 \n6. What are the main elements of the Copyright Regulations? \nBasic rule – paragraph 1.1:  a staff member who creates a Work resulting from or connected with \nthe staff member’s duties or employment owns copyright in the work, with some exceptions \ndiscussed below. \nAt the same time, Works are licensed to the University – paragraph 2.1:  the University is \nentitled to a licence (details about this below) to a Work referred to in paragraph 1.1, for all \npurposes within the University’s approved mandate under the PSLA. \nExceptions to the University’s licence are referred to in paragraphs 2.1 – 2.6:  the licence does \nnot apply to any Work created by a staff member “to fulfill assigned course responsibilities” \n(details about this below – the point:  no paragraph 2.1 licence to teaching materials). \nDespite those exceptions, and in specified circumstances, the University has limited rights to use \neven materials described in paragraphs 2.6 – 2.8, 2.9 (and paragraph 2.10 for some categories of \nAcademic staff):  e.g., if a staff member is unavailable or unable to deliver all or part of a course \nduly assigned to the staff member (the University’s rights will be only for the duration of the \ncourse for that academic year) \n7. Are there any situations in which an academic staff member would not own \ncopyright in a Work that he or she produced in connection with employment duties? \nThere are situations in which a staff member would not own copyright in a Work produced in \nconnection with job responsibilities.   \nUnder paragraph 1.4, a staff member would not have copyright in Work produced – generally – \nfor administrative purposes.  While 1.4 provides some context, guidance may also be provided \nby the “frequently asked questions” that will be prepared. \nParagraph 1.5 recognizes that a staff member may create a Work pursuant to a written agreement \n– he or she may be hired by the University to produce some creative product.  Intellectual \nproperty rights respecting that creative product will be addressed in the agreement. \nParagraph 1.6 recognizes that some types of research funding have provisions respecting \nintellectual property ownership – a condition of receiving the funding is complying with the \nintellectual property aspects of the arrangement.  It may be that under the terms of a funding \narrangement, the funder is to hold copyright in works produced with the research funding.  The \nUniversity, as intermediary between the researcher and the funder, may “obtain from the staff \nmember an assignment or licence of the copyright as necessary to fulfill [the University’s] \nobligations to the sponsor under the sponsored research funding agreement.” \nParagraph 1.7 recognizes that a staff member may – e.g., during a secondment – create Works \npursuant to a contract between the University and a third party.  In these cases, copyright \nownership and licensing are governed by such agreements. \nPage 4 of 7 \n8. Do the Copyright Regulations recognize “moral rights”? \nYes.  “Moral rights,” generally, are rights to claim authorship, to remain anonymous, or to use a \npseudonym; the right of integrity (the right to resist distortion or modification of a work that is \nprejudicial to the honour or reputation of the creator); and the right of association (the right to \nresist the use of a work in association with a product, service, cause, or institution, if such use \nwould be prejudicial to the honour or reputation of the creator). \nMoral rights are recognized in paragraph 1.3. \nAdditionally, paragraph 2.5 describes an academic type of moral right:  A staff member who \nreasonably believes that his or her Work is unsatisfactory for a proposed use because it is \noutdated, it is incomplete, its use would have a negative effect on the professional reputation of \nthe staff member, or there are “other academic grounds” to oppose its use, “may amend the Work \nor require that its use be withheld.  This right is an express limitation to the University’s \nparagraph 2.1 licence. \n9. What is the nature of the University’s licence to use Works created by academic \nstaff, referred to in paragraph 2.1? \nThe licence is  \n(a) “immediate” – it comes into existence when the Work comes into existence; no (e.g.) \nwritten licence agreement is necessary; \n(b) “non-exclusive” – the staff member may grant licences to use the Work to others; \n(c) “royalty free” – the staff member is not paid royalties for the University’s use of the \nWork (this is because – the Work having been created in the course of employment duties – the \nUniversity has supported its production financially); \n(d) “non-transferrable” – the University cannot transfer its licence to a third party (e.g. some \nsort of third party educational services provider); and \n(e) “irrevocable” – the staff member can’t unilaterally cancel the licence. \nThe licence is a right or permission to use the Work “for all purposes within the University’s \napproved mandate” under the PSLA.  Paragraph 2.2 provides some examples of these purposes. \nParagraph 2.4 recognizes that a staff member may agree to grant additional licence rights to the \nUniversity. \nPage 5 of 7 \n10. What if, as a condition of publication, a publisher requires the assignment of \ncopyright from the creator?  \nUnder paragraph 2.3, if a publisher requires the assignment of copyright to the publisher as a \ncondition of publishing, then the staff member has no copyright to licence to the University.  The \nparagraph 2.1 licence, then, does not arise.  The staff member is required to make “best efforts” \nto have a licence analogous to the paragraph 2.1 licence extended to the University.   Best efforts \nis assessed within the context of the situation.  It requires doing that which is known to be usual, \nnecessary and proper in attempting to secure the objective.  \n11. Are there any Works – besides those referred to in paragraph 2.3 – respecting \nwhich the University does not have a paragraph 2.1 licence? \nYes.  Generally, paragraph 2.6 excludes teaching materials from the paragraph 2.1 licence, with \ncertain exceptions (see question 13). \n12. But are there any circumstances in which the University could have a licence even to \nteaching materials? \nYes, in defined circumstances: \n(a) Under paragraph 2.7, the paragraph 2.1 licence extends to course outlines – but only \nconcerning those elements of a course outline that set out information required by GFC Policy \n(that is, the paragraph 2.7 exception does not capture a full syllabus or course readings and \ntopics). \n(b) Under paragraph 2.8, if a staff member is unable or unavailable to deliver all or part of a \ncourse duly assigned to that staff member, the University may use that staff member’s teaching \nmaterials to complete the delivery of the course.  This clause would apply, for example, if a staff \nmember died, became ill, or quit – the University would be under an obligation to registered \nstudents to finish the course, and the staff member’s materials could be used to do so.  The \nparagraph 2.8 licence is good for the duration of the academic year in question only.  Note that it \nonly applies if a course has been “duly assigned.”  The University could not – for example – use \nan instructor’s materials to deliver a course without having first assigned that instructor to that \ncourse. \n(c) Under paragraph 2.9, “[t]he University may use a Work described in paragraph 2.6 for \nthe purposes of unit accreditation, in connection with transfer credit determinations or as the \nUniversity may be required to meet its obligations to students.” \n13. What does paragraph 3.1 – which deals with computer programs – mean? \nHuman generated computer code (software), which gives rise to computer programs, are \ncopyright-protected.  In some cases, however, the integration of software in inventions may be \nprotected under patent rules.  Hence, not only copyright but patent rules may apply “to software \nPage 6 of 7 \nthat is patentable intellectual property.”  If a computer program is not patentable it remains \nprotected by copyright law only. \n14. What if a staff member uses his or her copyright-protected works to provide \neducational services for a competitor University? \nThe Copyright Regulations deal with copyright ownership. Use of copyright protected materials \nis still subject to the collective agreements, University policies and procedures, and the general \nlaw.  The point of paragraph 4.1 is that staff members’ use of copyright protected works is \nsubject to the University’s conflict of commitment and conflict of interest policy. \n15. What happens if a Work is created through the efforts of University personnel, (e.g.) \na grad supervisor and a student, or an academic staff member and a non-academic staff \nmember? \nParagraph 5.1 acknowledges that Works created collaboratively” present special challenges \nregarding copyright.”  Paragraph 5.2 - if the creators are University personnel, the relevant \nprovisions of policies, procedures and collective agreements (including the Copyright \nRegulations) will apply.  Paragraph 5.3 - if a written agreement is in place with third parties, then \nthat agreement will apply, or the general law in the absence of such an agreement.  Given the \nchallenges, potential collaborators should consider copyright ownership issues as soon as \npossible and consider entering a written agreement to deal with ownership issues before starting \nthe collaboration. \n16. How do the Copyright Regulations govern staff members’ intellectual property \nrights with third parties? \nThe Copyright Regulations govern the relationship between staff members as employees, and the \nBoard as their employer, under the collective agreements.  Ownership of Works created by staff \nwith or for publishers, external collaborators, funders, and (e.g.) the Tri-Council is determined by \na combination of the terms of the Copyright Regulations and the terms of the agreements with \nthose third parties (see paragraphs 1.6, 1.7 and 5.3). \nIt is important to note that copyright law is not the only area of law that applies to copyrighted \nWorks.  For example, the law of defamation) also applies to uses of copyrighted Works. \n17. Who do I contact if I have questions about my rights in a copyrighted work? \nThe AASUA should be your first point of contact, and is available to assist its members in \ndiscussions with University representatives on questions which may arise relating to rights to a \ncopyrighted work. \n18. Why is paragraph 2.10 included in the CAS:T, SOTS and TRAS agreements only? \nIt was recognized that in certain circumstances the University needs to be able to assign to these \ncategories of staff members the creation of “multi-course” or “multi-section” materials, with the \nPage 7 of 7 \nUniversity obtaining a license to use such materials in the future.  The more temporary nature of \nappointments under these agreements means the University needs to ensure it has the right to \ncontinue to use such materials past the end date of a staff member’s appointment. \n19. Why does the CAS:T agreement make reference to the length of the license back to \nthe University? \nSince CAS:T representatives on AASUA Council felt that limiting the duration that the \nUniversity could use their material for continuing teaching was important, the University agreed \nto their request to limit the length of the license to three years.   \n5 March 2016 \nItem No. 5 \nGFC ACADEMIC PLANNING COMMITTEE \nFor the Meeting of April 20, 2016 \nOUTLINE OF ISSUE \nAgenda Title: Proposal for a Dual Degree Graduate Program (MSc and PhD),  University of Alberta \n(Faculty of Graduate Studies and Research and Faculty of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences) \nand Universidade de Sao Paulo, Brazil (USP) \nMotion:  THAT the GFC Academic Planning Committee approve, with delegated authority from General \nFaculties Council, the proposal for Dual Master of Science and Doctoral Degree Graduate Programs \nbetween the Faculty of Graduate Studies and Research and the Faculty of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical \nSciences, University of Alberta, and Universidade de Sao Paulo, Brazil (USP) as set forth in Attachment 1, to \ntake effect upon final approval. \nItem \nAction Requested Approval Recommendation  Discussion/Advice Information \nProposed by Scot Simpson, Associate Dean Research and Graduate Studies, Faculty \nof Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences \nHeather Zwicker, Acting Vice-Provost and Dean, Faculty of Graduate \nStudies and Research (FGSR) \nPresenter Raimar Lobenberg, Director, Drug Development and Innovation Centre, \nFaculty of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences \nDeborah Burshtyn, Associate Dean, Faculty of Graduate Studies and \nResearch (FGSR) \nSubject Dual Master of Science and Doctoral Degree Graduate Programs \nbetween the University of Alberta’s Faculty of Pharmacy and \nPharmaceutical Sciences and Universidade de Sao Paulo, Brazil (USP) \nDetails \nResponsibility Provost and Vice-President (Academic) \nThe Purpose of the Proposal is \n(please be specific) \nFor the University of Alberta’s Faculty of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical \nSciences to offer Dual Master of Science and Doctoral Degree Graduate \nPrograms through an agreement with Universidade de Sao Paulo, Brazil \n(USP) \nThe Impact of the Proposal is To contribute to the internationalization of graduate degree programs in \nPharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences through collaboration with \nUniversidade de Sao Paulo, Brazil (USP) and to recruit strong graduate \nstudents. \nReplaces/Revises (eg, policies, \nresolutions) \nN/A \nTimeline/Implementation Date Upon final approval.

APPLICATION, SELECTION AND ADMISSION OF STUDENTS FOR THE DUAL \nDEGREE PROGRAM  \n3.1. A student wishing to pursue the Dual Degree Program must first formally apply \nfor admission into a master’s or doctoral degree program at their Home \nInstitution. The Home Institution will determine whether to admit an applicant in \nits sole discretion. \n3.2. A potential Dual Degree Student must meet the below eligibility requirements to \nbe considered for enrollment in the Dual Degree Program:  \na. PhD students are eligible to enter the Dual Degree Program after \ncompleting their program requirements except for the thesis (for \nstudents whose Home Institution is UAlberta) or, for students whose \nHome Institution is USP, their midterm evaluation exam. \nb. MSc students are eligible to enter the Dual Degree Program after \neither passing all their required coursework (for students whose Home \nInstitution is UAlberta) or their midterm qualification exam (for \nstudents whose Home Institution is USP). \nc. A supervisory committee will be formed for each prospective Dual \nDegree Student as per Section 4.3 and will be approved by both \ninstitutions according to their respective rules.  \nd. The supervisory committee will review the proposed research project \nand will recommend if the student should be admitted to the Dual \nDegree Program. \ne. Notwithstanding 3.2(a) and (b), the relevant authorities of both Parties \nmay decide that a student may enter the Dual Degree Program early.  \nf. It is expected that students will take all their required courses in their \nHome Institution before entering into the Dual Degree Program. \nHowever, if the supervisory committee makes an exemption to this \npolicy, they must assure that the required coursework is integrated \ninto the student’s study plan. \ng. To enter the Dual Degree Program, the potential Dual Degree Student \nmust fill out the relevant Application Form / Term of Commitment (see \nAppendix A) and present it to his/her Home Institution.  \n(i) The Application Form / Term of Commitment must specify \nthe name of the student, the title of the project that will be \ncarried out, work plan, the planned title of the thesis, \nnames of the advisors in both institutions and the name of \nthe graduate program and respective Area of \nConcentration, if relevant. If the Home Institution agrees to \nrecommend the student, the Application Form / Term of \nCommitment will be forwarded to the Second Institution, \nAgreement for a Dual Degree Doctoral Degree Program between USP and UAlberta Page 4 of 16 \nwhich will, within 30 days, inform the Home Institution of \nwhether the student is suitable to be admitted to the Dual \nDegree Program. \n3.3. The Second Institution will determine whether to register the student in the \nDual Degree Program at its sole discretion. A student is only considered a Dual \nDegree if both Parties have agreed to enrol him/her in the Dual Degree \nProgram. \n3.4. Each Second Institution will admit up to a maximum of two (2) Dual Degree \nStudents from each Home Institution each academic year for the Dual Degree \nProgram. The maximum number of students may be changed by mutual \nagreement of the Parties and shall be expressed in writing. \n3.5. While resident at USP, the Dual Degree Student will be considered a regular \nstudent.  While resident at UAlberta, the Dual Degree Student is a regular \ngraduate student in a degree program, and will have appropriate registration. \n3.6. Both institutions will seek to achieve reciprocity in the activities contemplated \nby this Agreement. \n3.7. Both institutions are committed to promoting the integration of the students in \nthe academic life of the Second Institution. \n3.8.

The Dual Degree Student’s home Faculty will \ntake the lead on assisting Dual Degree Students. \n4.2. Dual Degree Students will follow a program of study and research which shall \nsatisfy the degree requirements of both institutions including the following \nprovisions: \na. Coursework requirements at UAlberta include 6/12 credits (typically \n2/4 courses with each course weighted at 3 credits) at either the \nMSc/PhD-level as appropriate. Coursework requirements at USP \ninclude 25/20 credits (typically 5/4 courses with each course weighted \nat 5 credits) at MSc or DirectPhD-level/PhD-level as appropriate. \nb. At either university, Dual Degree Program students are not eligible to \ntake courses which are part of the professional pharmacy program. \nExceptions can only be made with the approval of the student’s \nsupervisory committee, the Dean of Pharmacy, and the Dean of the \nFaculty in which the course is offered. \nAgreement for a Dual Degree Doctoral Degree Program between USP and UAlberta Page 5 of 16 \nc. If a Dual Degree Program Student’s supervisory committee decides \nthat a student should take certain courses as part of the Dual Degree \nProgram, such courses must be offered in English if requested. \nd. Any mid-term evaluations or coursework should be done in English \nbut can be in Portuguese if deemed appropriate by the supervisory \ncommittee. \ne. USP shall waive the midterm qualification exam for UAlberta MSc \nDual Degree Program students. Other than this, each Home \nInstitution’s graduate course of study requirements are deemed \nequivalent and will be accepted by the Second institution. \nf. In accordance with UAlberta policy, every doctoral-level Dual Degree \nStudent must pass a doctoral Candidacy Examination before they can \nproceed to final thesis defense. In the case of Dual Degree Students \nwhose Home Institution is USP, the midterm qualification exam at \nUSP is considered equivalent to the UAlberta Candidacy Examination. \ng. At the end of the student’s stay at the Second Institution, the Second \nInstitution shall send to the appropriate body of the Institution the \nofficial document specifying the activities undertaken and the \nevaluations received, if applicable. At UAlberta, Dual Degree Program \nStudents from USP must formally request that the Registrar’s Office \nforward copies of their transcript to their Home Institution; transcripts \nwill not be sent without the consent of the Dual Degree Program \nStudent. \nh. Dual Degree Program Students whose Home Institution is UAlberta \nare required to participate in two graduate seminars – one during \ngraduate project coursework and one prior to the final oral \nexamination. Dual Degree Program Students whose Home Institution \nis USP are required to participate in one seminar prior to the final oral \nexamination. \ni. Both institutions recognize the supervision carried out at each \ninstitution and the approved defended thesis, and are authorized, \nunder the terms of the current legislation applicable to their respective \nselves, to grant doctoral and master’s degrees to eligible candidates.  \n4.3. Whether at the MSc or PhD-level, each Dual Degree Program student needs a joint \nsupervisory committee. \na. Every Dual Degree Student must have a supervisory committee of at \nleast three members.  \nb. The committee should have at least one faculty member from the \nSecond Institution as a supervisor. However, this member would not \nbe considered an external member in examining situations. \nAgreement for a Dual Degree Doctoral Degree Program between USP and UAlberta Page 6 of 16 \nc. This committee is to be established before the Student’s entry into the \nDual Degree Program. \nd. The committee will agree on a joint research topic and/or research \nproposal for the student. \ne. The committee must meet at least annually. At USP, Dual Degree \nStudents must submit progress reports to the committee bi-annually. \nAt UAlberta, progress reports must be submitted to the committee at \nleast annually. \nf. Any other additional requirements regarding the composition of the \nsupervisory committee or procedures for student guidance should \nconform to the requirements and regulations of the Dual Degree \nStudent’s Home Institution. \ng. The committee meetings must be in English. \n4.4. In accordance with UAlberta policy, every Dual Degree Student must meet \nUAlberta’s ethics and academic integrity training requirements set by the Faculty of \nGraduate Studies and Research.

The final accepted thesis has to be submitted to both institutions \n(together with a note of completion or relevant form for each \nInstitution). \nc. Copies of the regulations of each institution are included in Appendix \nB and the links are found here: \nFor USP: http://www.leginf.usp.br/?resolucao=resolucao-copgr-6861-\nde-06-de-agosto-de-2014  \nhttps://uofa.ualberta.ca/graduate-studies/current-students/academic-requirements/ethics\nhttps://uofa.ualberta.ca/graduate-studies/current-students/academic-requirements/ethics\nhttp://www.leginf.usp.br/?resolucao=resolucao-copgr-6861-de-06-de-agosto-de-2014\nhttp://www.leginf.usp.br/?resolucao=resolucao-copgr-6861-de-06-de-agosto-de-2014\nAgreement for a Dual Degree Doctoral Degree Program between USP and UAlberta Page 7 of 16 \nFor UAlberta: section 204.3 of the UAlberta Calendar -\nhttp://www.registrar.ualberta.ca/calendar/GradStudies-and-\nResearch/Regulations/204.3.html#204.3 \nd. The thesis will be defended in English and will be complemented by \nthe presentation of an oral summary in Portuguese. \ne. At UAlberta, an arm’s-length examiner must not be (or have been) a \nmember of the supervisory committee, or have been connected with \nthe thesis research in any significant way. \nf. At UAlberta, for the MSc thesis defence, there must be three \nexaminers with at least one at arm’s length. At USP, for the MSc \nthesis defense, there must be three examiners, with minimal PhD title, \nand at least one external to the student’s Program and external to \nFCF/USP and one external to USP and the supervisor (without voting \nrights).The examining/judging committee for the thesis defense will be \ndesignated by mutual agreement between both Parties and shall \nconsist of members from the two Parties. \ng. At UAlberta, examiners for the PhD candidacy exam must include at \nleast two arm’s length examiners and the supervisory committee. At \nUSP, examiners for the PhD midterm qualification examination must \ninclude two arm’s length, one external, and the supervisor.  \nh. At UAlberta, examiners for the PhD thesis final exam must include at \nleast two arm’s length examiners with one being external to both \ninstitutions, as well as the supervisory committee. At USP, for the PhD \nthesis defense, there must be three examiners, with minimal PhD title, \nand at least one external to the student’s Program and external to \nFCF/USP and one external to USP and the supervisor (without voting \nrights). The judging/examining committee for the thesis defense will \nbe designated by mutual agreement between both Parties and shall \nconsist of members from the two Parties. \n4.7. Notwithstanding section 4.6 above, the supervisory committee of a USP Dual \nDegree Student may determine that the student should adhere to UAlberta rules, \nregulations, and policies regarding the doctoral candidacy exam and final oral \nthesis defense in place of the USP rules, regulations, and policies regarding the \nmid-term qualification exam and the final thesis exam. \n4.8. The standard physical residency requirements for UAlberta are 12 months for a \nMSc and 36 months for a PhD. The standard physical residency requirements for \nUSP are 18 months for a MSc and 36 months for a PhD. The minimum physical \nresidency requirements for UAlberta Dual Degree Students at USP are 4 months \nfor a MSc and 6 months for a PhD. The minimum physical residency \nrequirements for USP Dual Degree Students at UAlberta are 6 months for a MSc \nand 6 months for a PhD. The actual residency requirements for each Dual \nDegree Student will fall between the minimum and the standard physical \nresidency requirements and the duration will be determined by the student’s joint \nsupervisory committee based on the student’s research proposal and progress. \nhttp://www.registrar.ualberta.ca/calendar/GradStudies-and-Research/Regulations/204.3.html#204.3\nhttp://www.registrar.ualberta.ca/calendar/GradStudies-and-Research/Regulations/204.3.html#204.3\nAgreement for a Dual Degree Doctoral Degree Program between USP and UAlberta Page 8 of 16 \nThe time a Dual Degree Student is physically resident at the Second Institution \ncan count towards the standard physical residency requirement of the student’s \nHome Institution. \n4.9. For USP students, all the credits will be completed at USP according to s. 3.2(f). \nIt is expected that students will take all their required courses in their Home \nInstitution before entering into the Dual Degree Program. USP does not require \nthe credits’ transfer. USP only requires the final accepted thesis and a note of \ncompletion. Dual Degree Students must meet all UAlberta requirements for the \nDual Degree Program. USP courses to be counted towards meeting the UAlberta \nprogram requirements must be listed in the Application Form/Term of \nCommitment. \n4.10. Once per academic year, the supervisory committee will review the Dual Degree \nStudent’s progress. The supervisory committee may recommend to the Parties \nthat the Dual Degree Student be removed from the Dual Degree Program. If \nremoved from the Dual Degree Program, the student will return to his/her \ngraduate studies at the Home Institution, and will receive appropriate credit for \nwork done at the Second Institution while in the Dual Degree Program.  \n4.11. Either Party may, at its sole discretion, require a Dual Degree Student to \nwithdraw from the Dual Degree Program. If required to withdraw from the Dual \nDegree Program, the student will return to his/her graduate studies at the Home \nInstitution and will receive appropriate credit for work done at the Second \nInstitution while in the Dual Degree Program. \n4.12. The Student may withdraw, at any time, from the Dual Degree Program, and \nreturn to his/her graduate studies at the Home Institution.

University Budget Principles\nThe University of Alberta manages its resources through integrated planning and budgeting. Our \nlong-standing budget principles are found in our Integrated Planning and Budgeting Policy, which \ncan be found in its entirety here: \nhttps://policiesonline.ualberta.ca/PoliciesProcedures/Policies/Integrated-Planning-and-Budgeting-\nPolicy.pdf.  \nThose principles are: \nThe University will be accountable and manage its resources through integrated planning and \nbudgeting. The process will:  \n• Be open and transparent, encouraging comprehensive input and consultation from students and\nacademic and support staff\n• Be driven by the Institution’s vision and the academic priorities of teaching and research.\n• Facilitate long-term planning and ensure a structurally balanced budget for the budget planning\ncycle.\n• Enable the provision of the necessary financial information, institutional data, budget\nprojections and other documentation.\n• Encourage the effective stewardship and explicit allocation and re-allocation of resources.\n• Support resource accountability.\n• To the extent practical, delegate budget responsibilities to the level in which operational\ndecisions are made.\n• Result in an institutional budget and forecast that represents all aspects of the University’s\noperations and is consistent in format with the Institution’s financial statements.\n2. Principles for Achieving a Sustainable Budget (2013-2014)\nIn May of 2013, when the University was undergoing budget reductions in reaction to a 7% budget \ncut, the following principles were presented to APC. This is provided for background information. \n   “Principles for Achieving a Sustainable Budget” \nThe University of Alberta will preserve the strength of the institution and its vision of excellence \nwhile achieving a sustainable budget. Change will be made in accordance with the university’s bi-\ncameral governance processes that reflect the commitment to student and staff participation and \nthe role of the Board in making final decisions. All decisions will be made in a timely way and \ncommunication with university stakeholders will be frequent and open. \nIn achieving a sustainable budget: \nhttps://policiesonline.ualberta.ca/PoliciesProcedures/Policies/Integrated-Planning-and-Budgeting-Policy.pdf\nhttps://policiesonline.ualberta.ca/PoliciesProcedures/Policies/Integrated-Planning-and-Budgeting-Policy.pdf\nN:\\2016-17 Files\\GO05 GFC & GFC Committees\\APC\\Budget Principles APC 20 April 2016.docx 2 \n1. The university will honour its mission and its vision as a comprehensive academic research\nintensive university with national and international impact\n2.
