            "Motion": "THAT the General Faculties Council, on the recommendation of the GFC Executive Committee, request that the GFC Committee on the Learning Environment report by 30 April 2017, on research into the use of student rating mechanisms of instruction in university courses. This will be informed by a critical review of the University of Alberta’s existing Universal Student Ratings of Instruction (USRIs) and their use for assessment and evaluation of teaching as well as a broad review of possible methods of multifaceted assessment and evaluation of teaching. The ultimate objective will be to satisfy the Institutional Strategic Plan: For the Public Good strategy to: Provide robust supports, tools, and training to develop and assess teaching quality, using qualitative and quantitative criteria that are fair, equitable, and meaningful across disciplines.

Discussion: Dr Dew reported that a member of GFC had submitted a Notice of Motion to the GFC Executive Committee regarding the use of the USRI. The GFC Executive Committee agreed that the issue was worthy of review, but that the scope needed to be broadened and provided GFC with a revised Motion. Dr Wendy Rodgers indicated that the format of student evaluation was being examined as were other aspects of teaching evaluation and that this process would involve research into available evidence on the subject, as well as community consultation. Following discussion about USRI response rates, a member suggested a friendly amendment to the Motion which would add “non-discriminatory” to the last sentence of the Motion. In addition, members engaged in a discussion surrounding incentivizing USRI completion.",

            "Description": "Purpose of the Proposal: To discuss a Augustana Scheduling Initiative which could potentially address student workload issues; faculty workload issues; greater flexibility in degree completion times; development of a first-year seminar; provide opportunities for first and second-year students to ‘sample’ courses; and the ability to accommodate students’ varying learning styles. Discussion: Dean Allen Berger and Associate Dean Karsten Mundel provided an overview of the Augustana scheduling initiative. This initiative would reorganize the term into courses which are offered in an intensive format for three weeks, followed by courses offered over the following 11 weeks; students would normally take one course over three weeks and four courses over 11 weeks. Dean Berger explained that this new schedule was intended to emphasize and accentuate the Faculty’s focus on community-based education, international and outdoor educational experiences, undergraduate research and connections to rural and aboriginal communities. A member noted his support of this initiative and invited the presenters to keep Council informed of the benefits to students through this endeavour. In regards to a question related to how the new schedule may impact student residence lease agreements, Dr Mundel clarified that the issue is currently under review. The Chair added that this proposal is a novel approach to education and thanked presenters for their summary.",

From the \nInstitutional Strategic Plan consultations to my first major international trip on behalf of the \nUniversity of Alberta, I have deepend my understanding of the U of A’s history, reach and impact, \nand built on its relations and reputations in our local and global communities. I believe these \nconnections will serve us well as we finalize planning and lay the groundwork for the university’s \nfuture.  \nI have also seen how quickly our community can come together to help others. Though the crisis \nhas been devastating, the U of A’s response to the Northern Alberta fires has been passionate \nand inspiring. Staff and volunteers prepared Lister Centre to receive evacuees almost overnight, \nand we are still sheltering approximately 800 people. The Butterdome distribution centre was \nestablished with equal vigour, and accomodated emergency funding distrubution to an estimated \n35,000 evacuees. The fundraiser BBQ held in Quad raised $16,435 for the Red Cross in \ndonations alone, and another $9,800 from food sales was donated to the new Disaster Relief \nBursary. Provost Steven Dew collaborated with provosts from around the province on an \ninititative to support students whose post-secondary applications may have been compromised. \nFrom grassroots drives and donations centres to major organized responses, the University of \nAlberta showed that it is ready to respond in times of need.   \nI am so proud to be part of this community. \nYours sincerely, \nDavid H. Turpin, CM, LLD, FRSC \nPresident and Vice-Chancellor \nItem No. 3\nhttp://www.president.ualberta.ca/\nIn addition to sharing good news about the University, this report is focused on three specific themes reflecting \nthe majority of my activity over the last few months: 1) Building Community Engagement, 2) the Institutional \nStrategic Planning Process, and 3) Advancing Specific Priorities. \n1. Building Community Engagement \nMy focus has been on establishing connections within the university and with our supporters locally, \nprovincially, nationally and internationally. Below is a summary of some of those activities since the March 21 \nGFC meeting: \nInternal connections \nChancellor - Douglas R. Stollery has been elected by the U of A Senate as our next Chancellor. Mr. Stollery is \na respected lawyer, community builder and philanthropist who is known for his commitment to social justice \nand humanitarianism locally, nationally and internationally. I look forward to learning from the experience, \nknowledge, and passion that he will bring to the university.  \nDean of Engineering – Dr. J. Fraser Forbes has been appointed dean of the Faculty of Engineering after \nserving as the interim dean for the past year. With 13 years of leadership experience as chair of the \nDepartment of Chemical and Materials Engineering, Dr. Forbes will undoubtedly advance the U of A and the \nFaculty of Engineering. \nChairs’ Council & Deans’ Council – I chaired both Chairs’ Council and Deans’ Council recently, and I was \nthankful for the opportunity to engage these groups and hear their thoughts first hand about the draft strategic \nplan and the budget.   \nVP Search committees – In February we launched the searches for both our next vice-presidents of Facilities \nand Operations and Finance and Administration. I have established one Advisory Search Committee to assist \nin both searches. The committee is comprised of individuals from across the university community. The \nposition descriptions have recently been posted, marking the formal launch of the recruitment process.  \nWahkohtowin Lodge – I visited the University of Alberta’s Augustana Campus in March to help celebrate the \nopening of Wahkohtowin Lodge, and to consult on the ISP. The new Indigenous student space is located in the \nForum Building at the heart of Augustana Campus, and is designed as a space where all students can meet, \nwork, relax and play. Through the pipe ceremony, opening celebrations and feast the sense of community was \nstrong and kinship among attendees was palpable.  \nExternal connections \nGovernment – This spring has seen first budgets from both our provincial and federal governments. I was \npleased so see that our significant investment in building relationships and advocating for post-secondary \neducation at all levels of government has borne fruit in the form of substantial and ongoing support. The \nAlberta government has committed to continue the level of stable funding initiated in Bill 3, and federally we are \nseeing investment in research and research support at levels not seen for a decade. U15, the Group of \nCanadian Research Universities, was strategic in their advocacy for support from the federal government, and \nI am happy with the results of that work for both infrastructure funding and support for the granting councils. \nWhile attending the Premiere’s State of the Province Luncheon the day after the release of the provincial \nbudget, I had the opportunity to sit with The Honourable Marlin Schmidt, Minister of Advanced Education and \nTechnology. It was a wonderful opportunity to discuss common goals, establish lines of communication, and \ndevelop our relationship with this important ministry.  \nIn his recent State of the City address, Mayor Iveson announced the Edmonton Health Innovation Strategy. A \npan-sectoral approach to expanding Edmonton’s health industry, the strategy identifies our city’s post-\nsecondary education network as a key component, especially with the University of Alberta’s leading research \nin a variety of health related fields. The Health Innovation Strategy provides an excellent opportunity to deepen \nour relationship with the City of Edmonton, to build on the successes of TEC Edmonton’s Health Accelerator \ninitiative, and to translate our research and expertise into a meaningful and impactful strategy for economic \ndiversification in the region.  \nU15 Meeting – On May 13, I attended a meeting of the U15 Executive Heads, along with several ministers and \nrepresentatives of the federal government. We discussed the strategic research priorities for Canadian \nuniversities over the next ten years. The meeting provided an excellent opportunity to advocate on behalf of \nthe University of Alberta and its interests, as well as maintain our connection to the U15, the federal \ngovernment and the national research agenda. \nU of A – East China Normal University MOU Renewal - On May 3, the U of A welcomed a senior-level \ndelegation led by Madam Xinyu Yang, Minister Counselor (Education) at the Embassy of People's Republic of \nChina in Canada, and Dr. Qun Chen, President of East China Normal University (ECNU) in Shanghai, China. \nThe visit held opportunities for discussions and meetings across campus, and the day culminated in signing \nthe UAlberta-ECNU MOU renewal and agreement on China Scholarship Council Sponsored Graduate \nStudents.  \nKillam Trustees Meeting – I recently travelled to Ottawa to meet with the Killam Trustees and the presidents \nof the other five Killam Institutions. We discussed the future of the endowments, as well as the best use of that \nfunding moving forward. The meeting will inform the Killam Steering Committee meeting scheduled for May 24.  \nHumboldt MOU – On May 6, The University of Alberta renewed its agreement with the Alexander von \nHumboldt Foundation by signing a new Memorandum of Understanding. The MOU confirms a strong \ncommitment to jointly support the activities of the Humboldt Foundation Liaison Office in Canada.   \nNorthern Indigenous Festival pipe ceremony – On March 5, I participated in a pipe ceremony with the \nMayor and representatives of the Confederacy of Treaty 6 First Nations, Treaty 7 First Nations, and Treaty 8 \nFirst Nations of Alberta to formally launch the planning process for the 2017 Northern Indigenous Festival, \nwhich is being planned as part of Canada’s sesquicentenary celebrations. \nEurope – During the last week of March and the first week of April, I travelled to Europe to meet with academic \npartners, donors, and alumni. We hosted a reception with High Commissioner Gordon Campbell at Canada \nHouse in London, and attended a luncheon hosted by the Canadian Ambassador to Germany. We also held \nmeetings with the Helmholtz and Liebnitz Institutes, and with Aachen University, where we discussed possible \nnext steps in growing our research partnerships. \nWorldwide Universities Network (WUN) – I attended the annual general meeting of the WUN with the \nUniversity of Alberta delegation in Maastricht, The Netherlands. The AGM presented an opportunity for \nresearchers, experts, administrators, practitioners and policy-makers to come together, provide an update on \nWUN’s activities, and discuss the future directions of the network and its focus on four Global Challenges: \nGlobal Higher Education and Research, Public Health (Non-communicable Disease), Responding to Climate \nChange, and Understanding Cultures. I also served as a panelist for a forum held in Brussels on \"Research \nOpportunities in European Global Engagement,\" contributing a Canadian perspective to the discussion. \nQuaecumque Vera Honour Society (QVHS) – When someone makes the remarkable decision to include the \nUniversity of Alberta in their estate planning, they are inducted into the QVHS. I recently met with QVHS \nmembers at luncheons in Calgary and Edmonton, and I was touched by the dedication and trust these \nmembers have placed in our institution.  \nMindshare – On April 18 the University of Alberta co-hosted a panel event with Universities Canada. This was \nthe first in a nationwide series of Mindshare lectures sponsored by Universities Canada to mark Canada’s \nupcoming 150th anniversary. Participants addressed various aspects of the future of energy, as well as how our \nsocieties will arrive at that future.  \nImre Szeman, the Canada Research Chair of Cultural Studies and co-director of the Petrocultures Research \nGroup at the University of Alberta, was one of the four panelists presenting at the event.  \nUS Consular visit with the Ex-Alta1 – Paul Davidson, President of Universities Canada, Provost Steven Dew \nand I were pleased to join Tom Palaia, the United States Consul General for Alberta, Saskatchewan and the \nNorthwest Territories, for a visit with the AlbertaSat team to discuss and view the Ex-Alta 1 satellite. The Ex-\nAlta 1’s purpose is to measure patterns of space weather along with nearly 50 other satellites, collecting \nmassive amounts of scientific data. The scale of this project will result in information that can affect the whole \nglobe – it is a wonderful opportunity for U of A students to collaborate with one another, and with other \ninstitutions around the globe on a real-time project. I was happy to share this innovative program with the \nConsul General.  \nUniversities Canada Meetings and SNOLAB Tour – I travelled to Toronto to meet with Universities Canada \nand participate in a conference, whose sessions covered the value of work-integrated learning, the importance \nof advancing women leadership, and building a culture of diversity and inclusion. I also had the opportunity to \ntour the SNOLAB underground physics laboratory, of which the University of Alberta is a founding member.  \n2. Institutional Strategic Planning Process \nThe first draft of the Institutional Strategic Plan, “For the Public Good,” was released to the community on \nMarch 11. Since then, Provost Steven Dew and I have held an additional 28 consultations including \nengagement with more than 850 members of the campus community, and have received additional on-line \nfeedback. I am very pleased with the level of campus community engagement and consultation. Within a few \nshort weeks, we hosted a final campus forum, four roundtables, and held discussions with the Board of \nGovernors, Alumni Council, the Students’ Union, Graduate Students’ Association, key governance committees, \nDeans’ and Chairs’ councils and several faculty and operational units. Input from the consultations and on-line \nfeedback were consolidated and brought to the ISP Advisory Committee. The response to the draft plan was \nextremely supportive, with much of the feedback expressing interest in how we will begin to implement the plan \nin the coming months and years.  \nThe final draft of “For the Public Good” was released on May 13. The draft has now started moving through the \ngovernance approval process. It has already been reviewed by the Academic Planning Committee, the \nGeneral Faculties Council Executive, and the Dean’s Council. Following the GFC Recommendation Review \nand the Board Learning and Discovery Committee Recommendation Review, the ISP will go to final review and \napproval by the Board of Governors on June 17.  \n3. Advancing Specific Priorities \nDisaster Relief Bursary – In response to the fires in Fort McMurray, and the U of A students whose academic \ncareers have been jeopardized by the crisis, the university and its alumni have created the Disaster Relief \nBursary. Moving forward, the bursary will assist students based on financial need due to loss or unforeseeable \ncosts related to a natural disaster, such as the Northern Alberta fires.  \nInfrastructure Funding – I am pleased to see extremely positive results from meetings and conversations \nwith both the provincial and federal governments in terms of infrastructure spending for research and \ninnovation. This investment will realize benefits for years to come by injecting funding for much needed \ninfrastructure investment. We have submitted our SIF proposals to the federal government for consideration. \nScholarships for Syrian Students – Two Syrian students are already finishing their first terms at the \nUniversity of Alberta under this program. I am pleased to report that several more students have been \nidentified as potential candidates, and letters offering the award to 10 individuals will be sent out soon.  \nPresident’s Visiting Committee (PVC) for Faculty of Medicine & Dentistry - I have established a PVC that \nwill conduct a review of the Faculty of Medicine & Dentistry at the end of May. The goal of such a committee is \nto review, evaluate and comment on the faculty, and provide guidance and advice to the President and Senior \nAdministration. Seeking to align our various review processes at the faculty level, the Office of the Provost and \nVP (Academic) is undergoing an audit of the PVC program, along with accreditation and unit reviews. I look \nforward to the results of the PVC and this audit, which will help us to plan more consistent, effective reviews in \nthe future.   \nHonorary Degrees announced – This June, the University of Alberta will welcome 11 influential and \ninspirational figures to campus to receive honorary degrees as part of its 2016 spring convocation festivities. I \nam pleased that all 11 of these outstanding individuals have agreed to receive this honor – they will \nundoubtedly inspire our newest alumni. Those being awarded Honorary Degrees during convocation are: \nSalah Bachir, Professor Dame Jocelyn Bell Burnell, Mark Carney, Lieutenant-General the Honourable Roméo \nDallaire, Tony Fields, Francis Morris Flewwelling, Ruth Kelly, Stephen Mandel, Jerome Nriagu, and Indira V. \nSamarasekera. Mary Robinson will be awarded her degree in a special ceremony on June 21.  \n4.

These values are drawn from the principles on which the University of \nAlberta was founded in 1908 and reflect a dynamic, modern institution of higher learning, leading change \nnationally and internationally. \nAbove all, we value intellectual integrity, freedom of inquiry and expression, and the equality and \ndignity of all persons as the foundation of ethical conduct in research, teaching, learning, and service. \nWe value excellence in teaching, research, and creative activity that enriches learning experiences, advances \nknowledge, inspires engaged citizenship, and promotes the public good. \nWe value learners at all stages of life and strive to provide an intellectually rewarding educational \nenvironment for all. \nWe value academic freedom and institutional autonomy as fundamental to open inquiry and the pursuit of \ntruth. \nWe value diversity, inclusivity, and equity across and among our people, campuses, and disciplines. \nWe value creativity and innovation from the genesis of ideas through to the dissemination of knowledge. \nWe value the history and traditions of our university, celebrating with pride our people, achievements, and \ncontributions to society.  \nI N S T I T U T I O N A L  S T R A T E G I C  P L A N  -  M A Y  2 0 1 6   \n5 \nD\nR\nA\nF\nT\nAt the University of Alberta, we begin with people—people with ideas, talent, and \npurpose. Then, we act. \nWe seek knowledge. We educate citizens. We ask the big questions. We push the limits of human \nunderstanding and knowledge. We engage with partners and communities close to home and around the \nworld to lead positive change. We empower creative people to take risks and make imaginative leaps towards \nas yet undetermined futures. \nWhy? The answer is simple: We are a public university acting for the public good. \nWhen we act, we provide meaningful educational experiences, promote innovative thinking, and develop \noriginal and compelling solutions that matter. When we lead, we tackle the most important local, national, and \nglobal challenges. When we excel, our work sparks and feeds widespread social, cultural, and economic \nbenefits for others—indeed for the uplifting of the whole people. \nIn For the Public Good—our institutional strategic plan for the coming decade—we embrace and affirm our \nvision to inspire the human spirit through outstanding achievements in learning, discovery, and citizenship in a \ncreative community, building one of the world’s great universities for the public good. \nWe forge ahead, motivated and supported by the University of Alberta’s 108-year history of leadership, \nachievement, and public service. Inspired by this plan, we will strive to achieve the following strategic goals: \nBUILD a diverse, inclusive community of exceptional students, faculty, and staff from \nAlberta, Canada, and the world. \nEXPERIENCE diverse and rewarding learning opportunities that inspire us, nurture \nour talents, expand our knowledge and skills, and enable our success.  \nEXCEL as individuals, and together, sustain a culture that fosters and champions \ndistinction and distinctiveness in teaching, learning, research, and service. \nENGAGE communities across campuses, city and region, province, nation, and the \nworld to create reciprocal, mutually beneficial learning experiences, research projects, \npartnerships, and collaborations. \nSUSTAIN our people, our work, and the environment by attracting and stewarding the \nresources we need to deliver excellence to the benefit of all. \nIn pursuit of these shared goals, the University of Alberta will deepen our dedication to excellence and extend \nour record of public leadership, playing a lead role in building a better province, a better Canada, and a better \nworld. \nI N S T I T U T I O N A L  S T R A T E G I C  P L A N  -  M A Y  2 0 1 6   \n6 \nD\nR\nA\nF\nT\nThe University of Alberta is the province’s leading educator, generator of new ideas, and engine of social, \ncultural, and economic prosperity.

In 1908, founding president Henry Marshall Tory reminded Albertans that “the modern state university \nhas sprung from a demand on the part of the people themselves” and promised “that knowledge shall not alone \nbe the concern of scholars. The uplifting of the whole people shall be its final goal.” He challenged future \ngenerations not to forget this ultimate goal. It has not been forgotten. We continue to seek mutually beneficial, \nreciprocal connections and collaborations with partners throughout the global academy, as well as with local, \nrural, and Indigenous communities. We work with industry, business, and government to find solutions to shared \nproblems. We engage with diverse partners to conduct and translate learning and research into evidence-based \npublic policy, improved industrial practices, changed attitudes, and healthier, more compassionate communities. \nWe sit at the centre of the province’s Campus Alberta and Edmonton’s City of Learners, working with our post-\nsecondary partners to provide Albertans with multiple integrated pathways to achieve their educational goals \nand aspirations.

Thank you for your engagement, advice, \nand feedback throughout the months of consultation and preparation of the document. \nAs a community, we have developed one long-term, multi-layered plan to guide the overall decision-\nmaking and governance processes of the University of Alberta. Some of the goals, objectives and \nstrategies envisioned here can be implemented immediately; others will unfold over the course of the \nnext decade. We anticipate the need for an in-depth review in year five. \nAt the highest level, “For the Public Good” is meant to empower and enable each member of the \nUniversity of Alberta to build, experience, excel, engage, and sustain. The successful implementation of \nthe plan will depend on all of us, individually and collectively, taking action. \nFollowing approval of “For the Public Good,” we will have three immediate tasks. \nThe first will be to determine priorities for the short, medium, and long-term. The president and \nprovost will lead this process and assign responsibility for specific goals at the institutional level. At the \nsame time, leaders across the university will begin to develop, or continue to work towards, parallel \nstrategic priorities and objectives that flow from the plan for specific faculties, departments, and units.  \nThe second will be to develop an equitable, meaningful, and relevant set of qualitative and \nquantitative measures by which we will monitor our progress and success on an annual basis over \nthe coming years. These measures will be determined by the president and provost in consultation with \nthe Institutional Strategic Planning Advisory Committee, Board of Governors, vice-presidents and \ndeans, General Faculties Council, and other key stakeholders across the university. \nThe third will be to create a transparent, effective, and sustainable annual institutional reporting \nprocess to ensure that we hold ourselves accountable to the plan at all levels of the university. As the \ntitle of this plan suggests, we must also develop avenues for internal and external communication of the \nuniversity’s annual progress to demonstrate in detailed, concrete ways how we, as a public university, \nare indeed acting for the public good. \nOnce the plan is approved, we will continue to communicate frequently on the progress and outcomes \nof these initial steps.  \nDavid H.

Over the years, there has been a significant amount of \nconfusion when the parties have attempted to interpret the Copyright \nRegulations as it is not clear from the language when the University \nwould own copyright and when it would be owned by the staff member.  \nThe generally accepted practice (although not strictly based on the \nlanguage) has been to acknowledge that academic staff own the \ncopyright in their teaching materials, but the University has some sort of \nItem No. 5 \nGENERAL FACULTIES COUNCIL \nFor the Meeting of May 30, 2016 \nlimited license to use that material. \nIn 2010, the University of Alberta and the AASUA agreed to form an \n“Agreement Review Committee” that would examine two aspects of \nintellectual property: a) copyright and b) the emerging issue of \nintellectual property that is not covered by patent or copyright practices.  \nThe ARC that was created has focused solely on the first issue - \ncopyright.  This ARC has been meeting regularly since and has \ndeveloped proposed new Copyright Regulations which would replace the \nexisting regulations in their entirety.  The ARC believes that the new \nlanguage creates greater certainty as it relates to copyright ownership \nand use.   \nThe key elements of the proposed new Regulations include: \n1.    Clear ownership by academic staff of copyright in works they create \nas a result of or connected with their duties or employment. \n2.    An immediate, non-exclusive, royalty-free, non-transferable and \nirrevocable license to the University to use these works for purposes \nrelated to its approved mandate. \n3.    A more limited license to the University to use a staff member’s \ndetailed teaching materials, for example if the staff member is unable or \nunavailable to deliver all or part of a course assigned to that staff \nmember during that academic year. \n4.    Ownership by the University of copyright of works created by a staff \nmember in the course of performing administrative or management \nduties or activities.   \n5.     A clear statement that a staff member’s copyright in works created \nas part of a sponsored research agreement is governed by the terms of \nthat agreement.  This gives the University the right to alter copyright \nownership in a sponsored research agreement, the way it is currently \nable to be done for Patentable Intellectual Property. \n*It is important to note that the proposed Regulations deal with copyright \nthat is created by a University of Alberta academic staff member in \nperforming his employment duties.  It does not apply to the use by the \nUniversity of copyright materials from other sources (textbooks, library \nbooks, online sources, etc).  There is a separate policy suite being \ndrafted that deals with such issues. \nAlignment/Compliance \nAlignment with Guiding \nDocuments \nDare to Discover, Dare to Deliver, Comprehensive Institutional Plan,  \nacademic collective agreements \nCompliance with Legislation, \nPolicy and/or Procedure \nRelevant to the Proposal \n(please quote legislation and \ninclude identifying section \nnumbers) \n1.

Attachment 2 (page(s) 1 - 7) Frequently Asked Questions Concerning the New Copyright Regulations, \n developed by the AASUA and University administration, dated March 5, 2016 \nPrepared by: Katharine Moore, Office of the Vice-President (Research) \n   email: katharine.moore@ualberta.ca; phone x20868 \n23/03/16 \nPage 1 of 7 \nFrequently Asked Questions Concerning the New Copyright Regulations \nPlease Note: These FAQs are for the information of academic staff members, and shall not \nbe used by any party in any dispute over the interpretation of the Regulations. \n1. What prompted the creation of the Agreement Review Committee (ARC) and the \ndrafting of the new Copyright Regulations? \n When the Association of Academic Staff negotiated the patent policy with the Board of \nGovernors, it was recognized that the collective agreement provisions regarding copyright \nneeded substantial revision.  Under the Post-secondary Learning Act of Alberta, whatever rights \nstaff have as individuals to their creative work is governed by the collective agreements between \nthe AASUA and the Board. As was seen at the time of the patent review, the current language is \nquite opaque and in need of revision.  Recognizing the need for change, the Board and AASUA \nagreed to form an “Agreement Review Committee” that would examine provisions of our \ncollective agreements regarding copyright, and to review two aspects of intellectual property: \ncopyright and the emerging issue of intellectual property that is not covered by patent or \ncopyright practices. The membership of this ARC has changed over time, but both the Board and \nthe AASUA are pleased to bring forward new Copyright Regulations.  \n2. Why did this process take so long? \n Due to the membership of the ARC and various members going on sabbatical leave or \nunable to serve on the ARC due to their work responsibilities, it was difficult to schedule \nmeetings.  It also took time to deliberate on the issues and to write language that was agreeable \nto both sides. \n3. What are the key principles underlying the new Copyright Regulations?  \nFirst, the idea was to replace confusing and out of date language in the academic staff collective \nagreements with language that would provide academic staff and the Board with clear guidance \non the subject.   \nSecond, the idea was to replace language asserting that the Board owns the copyright of staff \nworks in Article 10 with language starting with the principle that staff own the copyright to their \nwork, with some exceptions, discussed below.  \nThird, we wanted to add protections to ensure that the Board would have a license to use the \nwork of staff to do its core business in certain circumstances.   \nFourth, we settled on the principle benefiting both parties that in cases where the University \nneeded ongoing access to copyrighted materials, a non-exclusive license would allow staff to do \nwhat they wanted with materials they created even if they leave the University, while still \nallowing the University to continue to use key materials for specific purposes.  \nPage 2 of 7 \n4. If we didn’t have a collective agreement, who would own copyright in works \nproduced by academic staff in the course of their duties? \nIn the absence of provisions within a collective agreement, the Board of Governors – not \nacademic staff - would own the copyright to Works that “result from” or “are connected with”, \nstaff members’ duties or employment.  Section 68 of the Post-Secondary Learning Act provides \nas follows: \n68(1)  Unless otherwise agreed to by the board, the ownership of any invention, work, \ninformation or material, regardless of form, including any patent, copyright, \ntechnological or industrial design process or trademark acquired or produced by an \nofficer of the post‑secondary institution or an employee of the board that results \nfrom or is connected with the officer’s or employee’s duties or employment vests in \nthe board and may be made available to the public under conditions, on payment of fees \nor royalties or otherwise, as the board may determine. \n(2)  The board may compensate a person described in subsection (1). \n(3)  The board may enter into an agreement with a person to whom the board has \nprovided or proposes to provide facilities, equipment or financial aid providing for the \nrespective rights, obligations and liabilities of the board and the person with respect to the \nownership of any invention, work, information or material, regardless of form, including \nany patent, copyright, technological or industrial design process or trademark acquired or \nproduced by the person while engaged in a project funded in whole or in part by the \nboard. \n5. To what creative products do the Copyright Regulations apply?  What counts as a \n“Work”? \nFor the purposes of the Copyright Regulations, a Work is any creative product respecting which \ncopyright is recognized under the Copyright Act. Very generally, copyright applies to original \nliterary, dramatic, musical or artistic works – regardless of format or technology of presentation \n(digital movies as much as handwritten plays).  Copyright also applies (for example) to \n“performers’ performances,” which would include lectures. \nThe Regulations would also apply, for example, to online course products, such as “MOOCs”.  \nKeep in mind, though, that these sorts of projects can be expensive and involve many parties.  It \nwould be very likely that intellectual property rights will be dealt with by the contract(s) that \nestablish the project (see 1.5, 5).  If a staff member chooses to enter into these sorts of contracts, \nthe terms of the contracts shall govern copyright ownership.   \nThe Copyright Regulations do not apply to creative products that are not governed by the \nCopyright Act, such as inventions that fall under the Patent Policy, industrial designs, or \ntrademarks. \nPage 3 of 7 \n6. What are the main elements of the Copyright Regulations? \nBasic rule – paragraph 1.1:  a staff member who creates a Work resulting from or connected with \nthe staff member’s duties or employment owns copyright in the work, with some exceptions \ndiscussed below. \nAt the same time, Works are licensed to the University – paragraph 2.1:  the University is \nentitled to a licence (details about this below) to a Work referred to in paragraph 1.1, for all \npurposes within the University’s approved mandate under the PSLA. \nExceptions to the University’s licence are referred to in paragraphs 2.1 – 2.6:  the licence does \nnot apply to any Work created by a staff member “to fulfill assigned course responsibilities” \n(details about this below – the point:  no paragraph 2.1 licence to teaching materials). \nDespite those exceptions, and in specified circumstances, the University has limited rights to use \neven materials described in paragraphs 2.6 – 2.8, 2.9 (and paragraph 2.10 for some categories of \nAcademic staff):  e.g., if a staff member is unavailable or unable to deliver all or part of a course \nduly assigned to the staff member (the University’s rights will be only for the duration of the \ncourse for that academic year) \n7. Are there any situations in which an academic staff member would not own \ncopyright in a Work that he or she produced in connection with employment duties? \nThere are situations in which a staff member would not own copyright in a Work produced in \nconnection with job responsibilities.   \nUnder paragraph 1.4, a staff member would not have copyright in Work produced – generally – \nfor administrative purposes.  While 1.4 provides some context, guidance may also be provided \nby the “frequently asked questions” that will be prepared. \nParagraph 1.5 recognizes that a staff member may create a Work pursuant to a written agreement \n– he or she may be hired by the University to produce some creative product.  Intellectual \nproperty rights respecting that creative product will be addressed in the agreement. \nParagraph 1.6 recognizes that some types of research funding have provisions respecting \nintellectual property ownership – a condition of receiving the funding is complying with the \nintellectual property aspects of the arrangement.  It may be that under the terms of a funding \narrangement, the funder is to hold copyright in works produced with the research funding.  The \nUniversity, as intermediary between the researcher and the funder, may “obtain from the staff \nmember an assignment or licence of the copyright as necessary to fulfill [the University’s] \nobligations to the sponsor under the sponsored research funding agreement.” \nParagraph 1.7 recognizes that a staff member may – e.g., during a secondment – create Works \npursuant to a contract between the University and a third party.  In these cases, copyright \nownership and licensing are governed by such agreements. \nPage 4 of 7 \n8. Do the Copyright Regulations recognize “moral rights”? \nYes.  “Moral rights,” generally, are rights to claim authorship, to remain anonymous, or to use a \npseudonym; the right of integrity (the right to resist distortion or modification of a work that is \nprejudicial to the honour or reputation of the creator); and the right of association (the right to \nresist the use of a work in association with a product, service, cause, or institution, if such use \nwould be prejudicial to the honour or reputation of the creator). \nMoral rights are recognized in paragraph 1.3. \nAdditionally, paragraph 2.5 describes an academic type of moral right:  A staff member who \nreasonably believes that his or her Work is unsatisfactory for a proposed use because it is \noutdated, it is incomplete, its use would have a negative effect on the professional reputation of \nthe staff member, or there are “other academic grounds” to oppose its use, “may amend the Work \nor require that its use be withheld.  This right is an express limitation to the University’s \nparagraph 2.1 licence. \n9. What is the nature of the University’s licence to use Works created by academic \nstaff, referred to in paragraph 2.1? \nThe licence is  \n(a) “immediate” – it comes into existence when the Work comes into existence; no (e.g.) \nwritten licence agreement is necessary; \n(b) “non-exclusive” – the staff member may grant licences to use the Work to others; \n(c) “royalty free” – the staff member is not paid royalties for the University’s use of the \nWork (this is because – the Work having been created in the course of employment duties – the \nUniversity has supported its production financially); \n(d) “non-transferrable” – the University cannot transfer its licence to a third party (e.g. some \nsort of third party educational services provider); and \n(e) “irrevocable” – the staff member can’t unilaterally cancel the licence. \nThe licence is a right or permission to use the Work “for all purposes within the University’s \napproved mandate” under the PSLA.  Paragraph 2.2 provides some examples of these purposes. \nParagraph 2.4 recognizes that a staff member may agree to grant additional licence rights to the \nUniversity. \nPage 5 of 7 \n10. What if, as a condition of publication, a publisher requires the assignment of \ncopyright from the creator?  \nUnder paragraph 2.3, if a publisher requires the assignment of copyright to the publisher as a \ncondition of publishing, then the staff member has no copyright to licence to the University.  The \nparagraph 2.1 licence, then, does not arise.  The staff member is required to make “best efforts” \nto have a licence analogous to the paragraph 2.1 licence extended to the University.   Best efforts \nis assessed within the context of the situation.  It requires doing that which is known to be usual, \nnecessary and proper in attempting to secure the objective.  \n11. Are there any Works – besides those referred to in paragraph 2.3 – respecting \nwhich the University does not have a paragraph 2.1 licence? \nYes.  Generally, paragraph 2.6 excludes teaching materials from the paragraph 2.1 licence, with \ncertain exceptions (see question 13). \n12. But are there any circumstances in which the University could have a licence even to \nteaching materials? \nYes, in defined circumstances: \n(a) Under paragraph 2.7, the paragraph 2.1 licence extends to course outlines – but only \nconcerning those elements of a course outline that set out information required by GFC Policy \n(that is, the paragraph 2.7 exception does not capture a full syllabus or course readings and \ntopics). \n(b) Under paragraph 2.8, if a staff member is unable or unavailable to deliver all or part of a \ncourse duly assigned to that staff member, the University may use that staff member’s teaching \nmaterials to complete the delivery of the course.  This clause would apply, for example, if a staff \nmember died, became ill, or quit – the University would be under an obligation to registered \nstudents to finish the course, and the staff member’s materials could be used to do so.  The \nparagraph 2.8 licence is good for the duration of the academic year in question only.  Note that it \nonly applies if a course has been “duly assigned.”  The University could not – for example – use \nan instructor’s materials to deliver a course without having first assigned that instructor to that \ncourse. \n(c) Under paragraph 2.9, “[t]he University may use a Work described in paragraph 2.6 for \nthe purposes of unit accreditation, in connection with transfer credit determinations or as the \nUniversity may be required to meet its obligations to students.” \n13. What does paragraph 3.1 – which deals with computer programs – mean? \nHuman generated computer code (software), which gives rise to computer programs, are \ncopyright-protected.  In some cases, however, the integration of software in inventions may be \nprotected under patent rules.  Hence, not only copyright but patent rules may apply “to software \nPage 6 of 7 \nthat is patentable intellectual property.”  If a computer program is not patentable it remains \nprotected by copyright law only. \n14. What if a staff member uses his or her copyright-protected works to provide \neducational services for a competitor University? \nThe Copyright Regulations deal with copyright ownership. Use of copyright protected materials \nis still subject to the collective agreements, University policies and procedures, and the general \nlaw.  The point of paragraph 4.1 is that staff members’ use of copyright protected works is \nsubject to the University’s conflict of commitment and conflict of interest policy. \n15. What happens if a Work is created through the efforts of University personnel, (e.g.) \na grad supervisor and a student, or an academic staff member and a non-academic staff \nmember? \nParagraph 5.1 acknowledges that Works created collaboratively” present special challenges \nregarding copyright.”  Paragraph 5.2 - if the creators are University personnel, the relevant \nprovisions of policies, procedures and collective agreements (including the Copyright \nRegulations) will apply.  Paragraph 5.3 - if a written agreement is in place with third parties, then \nthat agreement will apply, or the general law in the absence of such an agreement.  Given the \nchallenges, potential collaborators should consider copyright ownership issues as soon as \npossible and consider entering a written agreement to deal with ownership issues before starting \nthe collaboration. \n16. How do the Copyright Regulations govern staff members’ intellectual property \nrights with third parties? \nThe Copyright Regulations govern the relationship between staff members as employees, and the \nBoard as their employer, under the collective agreements.  Ownership of Works created by staff \nwith or for publishers, external collaborators, funders, and (e.g.) the Tri-Council is determined by \na combination of the terms of the Copyright Regulations and the terms of the agreements with \nthose third parties (see paragraphs 1.6, 1.7 and 5.3). \nIt is important to note that copyright law is not the only area of law that applies to copyrighted \nWorks.  For example, the law of defamation) also applies to uses of copyrighted Works. \n17. Who do I contact if I have questions about my rights in a copyrighted work? \nThe AASUA should be your first point of contact, and is available to assist its members in \ndiscussions with University representatives on questions which may arise relating to rights to a \ncopyrighted work. \n18. Why is paragraph 2.10 included in the CAS:T, SOTS and TRAS agreements only? \nIt was recognized that in certain circumstances the University needs to be able to assign to these \ncategories of staff members the creation of “multi-course” or “multi-section” materials, with the \nPage 7 of 7 \nUniversity obtaining a license to use such materials in the future.  The more temporary nature of \nappointments under these agreements means the University needs to ensure it has the right to \ncontinue to use such materials past the end date of a staff member’s appointment. \n19. Why does the CAS:T agreement make reference to the length of the license back to \nthe University? \nSince CAS:T representatives on AASUA Council felt that limiting the duration that the \nUniversity could use their material for continuing teaching was important, the University agreed \nto their request to limit the length of the license to three years.   \n5 March 2016 \nItem No. 6 \nGENERAL FACULTIES COUNCIL \nFor the Meeting of May 30, 2016 \nOUTLINE OF ISSUE \nAgenda Title: Proposal for an Embedded Credit Certificate in Interdisciplinary Leadership Studies, \nFaculty of Business \nMotion:  THAT General Faculties Council, on the recommendation of the GFC Academic Standards \nCommittee, approve the Embedded Credit Certificate in Interdisciplinary Leadership Studies, as submitted by \nthe Faculty of Business, and as set forth in Attachment 1, to be effective upon approval.  \nItem   \nAction Requested Approval Recommendation  Discussion/Advice Information \nProposed by Elaine F. Geddes, Associate Dean, Undergraduate Programs, Faculty of \nBusiness \nPresenter Joseph Doucet, Dean, Faculty of Business; Elaine F. Geddes, Associate \nDean, Undergraduate Programs, Faculty of Business; Nat Kav, Chair, \nGFC Academic Standards Committee \nSubject Proposed Embedded Certificate in Interdisciplinary Leadership Studies \nDetails \nResponsibility Provost and Vice-President (Academic) \nThe Purpose of the Proposal is \n(please be specific) \nThe Certificate in Interdisciplinary Leadership Studies will provide \nstudents with formal recognition of the leadership skills they have \nacquired through their coursework and through their experiences at the \nPLLC. The certificate will indicate to employers and graduate schools \nthat the students have taken courses, have participated in co-curricular \nprograms, and have had stretch experiences through which they have \ndeveloped the ability to tackle the challenges of leadership in all aspects \nof their lives. It will be available to students in multiple Faculties. \nAn Inaugural Class was recruited in 2015 and began their studies in \nSeptember 2015 with the courses INT D 301 and INT D 306. If the \nCertificate is approved, these students and students in subsequent \nclasses will be awarded the Certificate upon completion of the required \ncoursework and the stretch experience. \nThe Impact of the Proposal is PLLC will create opportunities for learning that will develop leadership \nskills and competences through enhanced formal and co-curricular \nprograms, experiential learning, engagement with a wide range of \nleadership styles, commitment to ethical behaviour and social \nresponsibility, and with access to excellence in mentorship. \nReplaces/Revises (eg, policies, \nresolutions) \nN/A \nTimeline/Implementation Date Upon approval \nEstimated Cost Funding to support the Certificate and related activities is in place, and \nno funding will be diverted from other University of Alberta sources. \nSources of Funding The Peter Lougheed Leadership College is supported by dedicated \nGovernment of Alberta funding and by private donors. \nNotes It was noted by the GFC Academic Standards Committee that Faculty \nrequirements may preclude certain students (such as those with \npracticum experiences, university athletes, etc)  from participating in the \ncertificate due to the scheduling of courses; consideration will be given to \nItem No. 6 \nGENERAL FACULTIES COUNCIL \nFor the Meeting of May 30, 2016 \nhow these students can be accommodated in the future.  \nAlso at the GFC Academic Standards Committee meeting, it was \nsuggested that the last sentence of the course descriptions be revised to \nincrease clarity including who is eligible to take the course and what \nFaculty is offering it. INT D 407 reflects this change and is currently in \ncirculation in accordance with GFC Policy 37. The remaining three \ncourses will follow GFC policy on course changes to reflect similar \nwording.  \nAlignment/Compliance \nAlignment with Guiding \nDocuments \nDare to Discover, Dare to Deliver. This program supports the vision of \nthe University of Alberta in Dare to Deliver to build a university for the \npublic good. \nThe Certificate in Interdisciplinary Leadership Studies will also help to \nrealize the vision of the new Institutional Strategic Plan. It will help to \nbuild a diverse, inclusive community of exceptional students, faculty and \nstaff from Alberta, Canada and the world. These students will be able to \nexperience diverse and rewarding learning opportunities, excel as \nindividuals, and together, sustain a culture that fosters and champions \ndistinction and distinctiveness in teaching, learning, research, and \nservice. The Certificate will help students engage with communities \nacross campuses, the province, Canada and the world to create \nreciprocal, mutually beneficial learning experiences, research projects, \npartnerships, and collaborations. \nCompliance with Legislation, \nPolicy and/or Procedure \nRelevant to the Proposal \n(please quote legislation and \ninclude identifying section \nnumbers) \n1. Post-Secondary Learning Act (PSLA): The PSLA gives GFC \nresponsibility, subject to the authority of the Board of Governors, over \nacademic affairs. Further, the PSLA gives the Board of Governors \nauthority over certain admission requirements and rules respecting \nenrolment. The Board has delegated its authority over admissions \nrequirements and rules respecting enrolment to GFC and the GFC ASC. \n(Sections 26(1), 60(1)(c) and (d)). \n2. GFC Academic Standards Committee (ASC) Terms of Reference \n(3. Mandate of the Committee): \n“G. Certificates (All Faculties): Approval Route \nGFC delegated to ASC the authority to approve proposals for the \nestablishment of and termination of credit and non-credit certificates, \nregardless of the proposing academic unit. Where additional funding \nand/or space is required to support the offering of the proposed \ncertificate and/or if, in the opinion of the Provost and Vice-President \n(Academic) (or delegate), the certificate requires Government approval, \nASC would provide a recommendation on the (proposed) initiative to the \nGFC Academic Planning Committee (APC). (GFC 31 MAY 2005) (EXEC \n12 JAN 2009)” \n3. PSLA: The PSLA gives Faculty Councils power to “provide for the \nadmission of students to the faculty” (29(1)(c)). \n4. UAPPOL Admissions Policy: “Admission to the University of Alberta \nis based on documented academic criteria established by individual \nFaculties and approved by GFC. This criteria may be defined in areas \nItem No. 6 \nGENERAL FACULTIES COUNCIL \nFor the Meeting of May 30, 2016 \nsuch as subject requirements, minimum entrance averages, and \nlanguage proficiency requirements. In addition to academic requirements \nfor admission, GFC authorizes each Faculty to establish such other \nreasonable criteria for admission of applicants as the Faculty may \nconsider appropriate to its programs of study, subject to the approval of \nGFC (e.g. interview, audition, portfolio, etc.) \nThe admission requirements for any Faculty will be those approved by \nGFC as set forth in the current edition of the University Calendar. In \naddition to the admission requirements, selection criteria for quota \nprograms, where they exist, will also be published in the current edition \nof the University Calendar. The responsibility for admission decisions will \nbe vested in the Faculty Admission Committees or in the Deans of the \nrespective Faculties, as the councils of such Faculties will determine.” \n5. UAPPOL Admissions Procedure: \n“PROCEDURE \n1. EFFECTIVE DATE OF CHANGES TO ADMISSION REGULATIONS \nFollowing approval by GFC: \na. Where changes to admission regulations may disadvantage students \nin the current admission cycle, normally implementation will be effective \nafter the change has been published in the University Calendar for one \nfull year (i.e., effective the second year that the information is published \nin the University Calendar). \nFor example, a change approved in May 2005 would be first published in \nthe 2006-2007 University Calendar in March 2006. Therefore the \nstatement cannot come into effect until September 2007 (affecting \napplicants who apply for the September 2007 term beginning July 2006). \nb. Where changes to admission regulations are deemed by the \napproving body to be ‘advantageous to students’, normally the date of \nimplementation will be effective immediately or at the next available \nintake for the admitting Faculty.” \n6. PSLA: The PSLA gives Faculty Councils the authority to “determine \nthe conditions under which a student must withdraw from or may \ncontinue the student’s program of studies in a faculty” (Section 29(1)(d)). \n7. UAPPOL Academic Standing Policy: “All current academic standing  \nregulations, including academic standing categories, University \ngraduating standards and requirements for all individual programs will be \nthose prescribed by Faculty Councils and GFC as set forth in the \nUniversity Calendar.” \n8. UAPPOL Academic Standing Regulations Procedures: “All \nproposed new academic standing regulations and changes to existing \nacademic standing regulations will be submitted by the Faculties or the \nAdministration to the Provost and Vice-President (Academic). Faculties \nwill also submit to the Provost and Vice-President (Academic) any \nproposed changes to the use and/or computation of averages relating to \nItem No. 6 \nGENERAL FACULTIES COUNCIL \nFor the Meeting of May 30, 2016 \nacademic standing, including promotion and graduation. \nIf the Provost and Vice-President (Academic) determines the proposal to \nbe in good order, the proposal will be introduced to the appropriate \nUniversity governance process(es). In considering these proposals, \ngovernance bodies will consult as necessary with the Faculties and with \nother individuals and offices. \nNormally, changes become effective once they are approved by GFC or \nits delegate and are published in the University Calendar.” \n9. GFC Executive Committee Terms of Reference (3. Mandate of the \nCommittee) \n“5. Agendas of General Faculties Council \nGFC has delegated to the Executive Committee the authority to decide \nwhich items are placed on a GFC Agenda, and the order in which those \nagenda items appear on each GFC agenda. \n[…] \nWith respect to recommendations from … GFC committees [excluding \nAPC], however, the role of the Executive Committee shall be to examine \nand debate the substance of reports or recommendations and to decide \nif an item is ready to be forwarded to the full governing body. The \nExecutive Committee may decide to refer a proposal back to the \noriginating body, to refer the proposal to another body or individual for \nstudy or review, or to take other action in order to ready a proposal for \nconsideration by General Faculties Council. When the GFC Executive \nCommittee forwards a proposal to GFC, it shall make a recommendation \nthat GFC endorse; endorse with suggested amendments; not endorse; \nor forward the proposal with no comment.” \n10.

Identify which \ninstitution(s) will award the \ncredential.  \nUniversity of Alberta \nUnits of Course Weight *12 \nThe Certificate in Interdisciplinary Leadership Studies will be made up of four \ncourses for a total course weight of *12. One of the courses consists primarily of a \ncapstone project. In addition, there is a significant experiential component. Students \nare required to engage in a non-credit stretch experience in the summer between the \nfirst and second year of the program. None of the courses that make up the \nCertificate in Leadership Studies are required courses for a student’s degree. All \ncourses required by this certificate are Senior Electives at the 300 and 400 level. \nProgram Synopsis \nDescribe the program. Include \ncurriculum content, target student \ngroup, target employment, further \neducation options, etc.  \nIn addition to the required coursework, the Peter Lougheed Leadership College \n(PLLC) will create opportunities for learning that will develop leadership skills and \ncompetences through enhanced formal and co-curricular programs, experiential \nlearning, engagement with a wide range of leadership styles, commitment to ethical \nbehaviour and social responsibility, and with access to excellence in mentorship. \nThe Certificate in Interdisciplinary Leadership Studies will provide students with \nformal recognition of the interdisciplinary courses taken and the leadership skills \nacquired through their participation at the PLLC. The certificate will indicate to \nemployers and graduate schools that the students have taken courses, have \nmailto:martin.ferguson-pell@ualberta.ca\nmailto:martin.ferguson-pell@ualberta.ca\nmailto:elaine.geddes@ualberta.ca\nmailto:elaine.geddes@ualberta.ca\nApril 21, 2016 \nparticipated in co-curricular programs, and have had stretch experiences through \nwhich they have developed the ability to tackle the challenges of leadership in all \naspects of their lives. It will be available to undergraduate students in multiple \nFaculties. \nWhile completing their undergraduate degree program in their respective faculties, \nstudents will complete 12 units of course weight. The courses include INT D 301 \nFoundations of Leadership, INT D 306 Topics in Leadership, INT D 406, \nLeadership Capstone Project, INT D 407 Workshop in Leadership.  In addition, a \nnon-credit Stretch Experience in the summer between Years One and Two of the \ncertificate will be offered by PLLC. (See Appendix A for more information).  \nCoursework is delivered with the assistance of Teaching Fellows, most of whom are \ngraduate students or their equivalent, and all of whom are trained to deliver course \ncontent and perform assessment of students. The Teaching Fellows are given \nextensive training in both the content of the course and in instruction, particularly \npedagogical approaches to small group learning. Students work in small \ninterdisciplinary cohorts. Some portions of the lectures are open to the public. \nAll students have an opportunity to be mentored by outstanding members of the \ncommunity who have volunteered their time to be trained in mentorship, and to \nserve as mentors to students. See Appendix E for the Mentorship Team. \nA Pioneer class was enrolled in 2015-16 to run a pilot of the first year of the \nCertificate. If the Certificate is approved, students from this group who wish to and \nare eligible to continue would be permitted to enrol in the second year of the \nCertificate program. \nSection B: Rationale, Implications and Impact  \nRationale for Introduction of \nCertificate \nOutline the rationale for the \nproposed embedded credit \ncertificate and provide supporting \ndata if applicable – eg. Results of \nstudent or economic demand \nanalyses; consultation with wider \ncommunity, etc.   \nIn April 2010 the University of Alberta’s Dean of Students, F. E. Robinson, and the \nRegistrar, G. Kendal, released a proposal, Leadership and the Student Experience. \nThe proposal identified the range and scope of student leadership opportunities and \ninitiatives at the University.  \nAt the end of the proposal the authors recommended the establishment of a \nLeadership College at the University of Alberta. With Henry Marshall Tory’s vision \nin mind, the College’s purpose would be “to honour the brand promise ‘to uplift the \nwhole people’ through leadership, through operation of a residential college.”  \nTheir vision for the Leadership College included the following specific components  \n● Leadership programming provided  \n● Opportunities for formal and informal leadership/learning possibly leading \nto a Certificate in Leadership (emphasis added) \n● Guided by a senior academic “principal in residence”  \n● Residence will house 150 students on North Campus  \n● Guest accommodation for honorary degree recipients, distinguished alumni, \nvisiting speakers etc. \nApril 21, 2016 \nThe Peter Lougheed Leadership College will create a wide array of opportunities \nfor undergraduates and emerging leaders to gain the skills, experience and \nunderstanding so that they may demonstrate excellence in leadership in all their \nwalks of life and use them to the greater benefit of society.  \nThere are many programs already in place on campus that address topics included \nand are therefore a valuable resource to the PLLC and may be in fact augmented by \nPLLC; however, PLLC does not intend to disrupt any of the excellent work already \nin place. \nVision and Academic Plan \nHow does the proposed program \nconnect to the University’s vision \nDare to Discover? How does the \nprogram further the University’s \nAcademic Plan?  \nOne of the four cornerstones of Dare to Discover is “Learning Discovery and \nCitizenship.” An objective for this cornerstone is to “inspire students, faculty, and \nstaff alike to engage in activities that develop leadership, foster social and moral \nresponsibility, and contribute to the further development of our society and its \ninstitutions.”  \nThe PLLC will create a resonance across campus that mobilizes resources, expertise \nand knowledge to involve the broadest range of students, as widely as possible, in \npreparation for their roles as engaged and critically thinking leaders of their \ngeneration. \nThe Certificate in Interdisciplinary Leadership Studies will also help to realize the \nvision of the new Institutional Strategic Plan. It will help to build a diverse, \ninclusive community of exceptional students, faculty and staff from Alberta, \nCanada and the world. These students will be able to experience diverse and \nrewarding learning opportunities, excel as individuals, and together, sustain a \nculture that fosters and champions distinction and distinctiveness in teaching, \nlearning, research, and service. The Certificate will help students engage with \ncommunities across campuses, the province, Canada and the world to create \nreciprocal, mutually beneficial learning experiences, research projects, partnerships, \nand collaborations.  \nResource Implications \nIdentify the resource implications \nof the proposed embedded credit \ncertificate. Identify if resources are \nbeing re-allocated to or from other \nareas, and outline the implications \nof this re-allocation.   \nWhile resources are required to develop and deliver course and program outcomes, \nthe cost for these is being absorbed by the Peter Lougheed Leadership College. The \nCollege is already created and has been funded by a restricted grant from the \nGovernment of Alberta and private donors. The Certificate in Interdisciplinary \nLeadership Studies is one of the central programs promised by PLLC to both the \nGovernment of Alberta and private donors.  Funding to support the Certificate and \nrelated activities is in place, and no funding will be diverted from other University \nof Alberta sources.  No reallocation of resources will take place within the \nUniversity of Alberta. \nAs this is an embedded certificate, students will not be required to take any \nadditional courses beyond those required or permitted in their primary programs. \nThere would normally be no additional tuition fees. Students would not normally \nextend their degree programs in order to complete the certificate, thus there would \nalso not normally be any additional expenses incurred by students. \nEnrolment \nOutline the expected enrolment for \nthe embedded credit certificate and \nAfter full roll-out, 125 students per year are expected to be accepted into the \nCertificate in Interdisciplinary Leadership Studies making the total head count in \nthe certificate 250 students per year. Students will be given the opportunity to live \nApril 21, 2016 \nany potential impacts on course \nofferings. \nin residence as a “Leadership College” cohort. Participation as a resident will be \nvoluntary and will not be a requirement for being accepted to PLLC. \nImplications of Introduction \nof the Credit Certificate \nIdentify the implications of the \nproposed embedded credit \ncertificate for the system. For \nexample, will it affect other \nprograms at the U of A, programs \nat other institutions, etc.?  \nIt is not anticipated that the introduction of the Certificate in Interdisciplinary \nLeadership Studies will affect the enrolment of other programs. The certificate will \nbe embedded within other degree programs so that students will continue in their \nexisting programs after admission to the Certificate. Most programs have sufficient \nelective space within their programs to accommodate the Certificate. It will be up to \neach individual Faculty to decide the extent to which they will accommodate \nstudents if necessary within existing program requirements. Normally, students \nwould not be permitted to take a leave of absence from their primary program to \npursue the certificate. \nThe four Faculties in charge of the four courses that make up the Certificate (ALES, \nArts, Business and Science) form a committee, along with the Vice Provost \nPrograms, called the Academic Oversight Committee that provides advice to the \nFaculty of Business and the PLLC on the content and administration of the \nCertificate. The Academic Oversight Committee also provides advice to the Faculty \nof Business on the administration of the Certificate and on liaison with other \nFaculties. (See Appendix G for the Terms of Reference for the Academic Oversight \nCommittee.)  \nThe Academic Oversight Committee will be responsible for developing review \nmechanisms to ensure continuous quality improvement. Outcomes assessment, \nmeasurement and feedback loops will be established to assist in program \nimprovements. The Faculty of Business has recently gone through a program \nevaluation including the development of a thorough Assurance of Learning process \nso is experienced in leading this type of quality control. The Peter Lougheed \nLeadership College has been conducting thorough and extensive interviews and \nTown Halls with students and with Teaching Fellows of the Pioneer class to get \nfeedback on the pilot program run in 2015-16. This information will be used to \nfurther refine courses and course delivery for 2016-17. \nThe Faculty of Business will have the responsibility of liaison with other Faculties \nto ensure compliance with University and Faculty policies and procedures. \nResources have been allocated to the Faculty of Business from the Peter Lougheed \nLeadership College to ensure that adequate student support services are available \nfor Certificate students without affecting the level of support currently provided to \nBusiness students. The Faculty of Business will also have the responsibility to \nensure that Stretch Experiences are adequately evaluated, supervised and controlled \nto ensure student benefit, The Faculty of Business has extensive experience in \nmonitoring Co-operative Education placements, academic exchanges, student \nconferences, competitions and events, and will be able to exercise oversight in this \narea. Students will be subject to all of the usual controls over student activity with a \nconnection to the University of Alberta, including the Code of Student Behaviour, \nand the Practicum Placement Policy. \nIt is expected that if other faculty-specific leadership certificates are established in \nthe future, some students will enrol in both. Since students are able to enrol in up to \ntwo credit certificates some will take advantage of this opportunity. Students may \nApril 21, 2016 \nalso take non-leadership certificates offered by other faculties where they have \nsufficient room in their programs. \nNo effect on programs at any other institution is anticipated. The Certificate in \nInterdisciplinary Leadership Studies may have a positive effect on recruitment \noverall at the University of Alberta as it becomes more well-known. \nConsultation \nDescribe any consultation and/or \npotential impacts on service units \nof the University, including the \nOffice of the Registrar and Student \nAwards, Academic Information and \nCommunication Technologies \n(AICT), Library Administration, \nFacilities and Operations, Student \nServices, etc.  \nIn 2014-15, prior to the recruitment of the Inaugural Class, the Right Honourable \nKim Campbell, Founding Principal of the PLLC along with Martin Ferguson-Pell, \nwho was at the time Senior Advisor to the President, had extensive consultations \nwith the diverse members of the campus community regarding the Certificate in \nInterdisciplinary Leadership Studies, including with: \n● Members of the PLLC Coordinating Committee and the PLLC Academic \nAdvisory Committee \n● Former Provost, Carl Amrhein \n● Office of the Provost: Olive Yonge, Deputy Provost; Roger Epp, Vice-\nProvost (Academic); Brenda Leskiw, Associate Vice-Provost (Academic \nPrograms and Instruction) \n● Deans of all Faculties \n● General Faculties Council \n● The Student Union \n● The Graduate Students Association \n● Representatives of Indigenous people \n● Government Consultation (Municipal, Provincial, Federal) \nPLLC has presented before all committee of the University of Alberta on multiple \noccasions, and in particular before General Faculties Council. As a result of \nconcerns expressed in some of those meetings, an Academic Oversight Committee \nwas established in 2015 to provide for advice, counsel and assistance to the PLLC \non academic and administrative matters. See Appendix B for the makeup of that \ncommittee.  \nThe two courses INT D 301 and INT D 306 have already been approved by the \nUniversity of Alberta through its normal circulation process.

Background \nThe University of Alberta’s Peter Lougheed Leadership College (PLLC), is a broad, inclusive \ncommunity of undergraduate students, graduate teaching fellows and instructors. The \nPLLC creates opportunities for leadership development through enhanced formal and co-\ncurricular programs, experiential learning, and engagement with a wide range of \nleadership styles, commitment to ethical behavior and social responsibility, and with \naccess to excellence in mentorship.  \nThe work of the PLLC is guided by the following foundational statements: \nVision Statement \nThe Peter Lougheed Leadership College is a thriving and vibrant centre of excellence for \nleadership development where students are immersed in and benefit from leading-edge \nlearning experiences. \nMission Statement \nThe Peter Lougheed Leadership College is dedicated to creating an exceptional \ninterdisciplinary, multiple campus and collaborative learning environment in which students \ngain the attributes, skills and competencies essential for their life endeavors. \nPLLC Values and Principles  \nAs part of the University of Alberta, the PLLC relies on the shared values of the University \nof Alberta that are centred on the principle of “uplifting of the whole people” and form the \nbedrock for our behaviour and guides our actions and interactions. These values represent \nhow the PLLC expects to travel toward fulfillment of its mission and vision.  \nPLLC values Principles of Practice that reflect PLLC values \nEmbodiment of \nleadership \npractices  \nBased on the example set by Peter Lougheed, the work of the PLLC will model and \nset an example for the leadership practices of ethical responsibility, authenticity, \ncritical/strategic thinking, effective communication, and acting with integrity.   \nDiversity of \nlearning \nexperiences \n● The student-centred learning approach at the PLLC will utilize a range of \nlearning processes including cutting edge digital learning, experiential \nlearning, opportunity to participate in an immersive residential experience, \nand mentorship.  \n● Formal learning experiences will be evidence-based and closely linked to \nscholarship in leadership practices. \nInterdisciplinary \ncollaboration \nand synergy \nFrom design to delivery, the PLLC will identify and utilize the wealth of \nexperience, scholarship, and collective wisdom of the academy, its partners, and \nthe broader community to optimize learning experiences for all.  \nApril 21, 2016 \nAccessible \nparticipation  \nThe inclusive approach to leadership development at PLLC ensures that:  \n● The composition of the PLLC leadership cohorts are representative of the \nUniversity of Alberta campus as a whole.  \n● Leadership opportunities are coordinated and shared across the entire \ncampus as the college serves the university as a catalyst for excellence in \nleadership practice and mentoring in any setting. \nII. The PLLC Leadership Certificate \nA key component of the PLLC is an embedded academic certificate.  As an administrative \nunit of a UofA presidential initiative, the PLLC operates in collaboration with the UofA \nacademic system.   Therefore, to meet the academic oversight and governance \nrequirements for an embedded certificate, the academic certificate will be hosted by a \ndesignated faculty. As well, to support the inter-disciplinary nature of the PLLC, each of the \nacademic credit courses will be offered by a different faculty.    \nThis complex context presents unique challenges and opportunities for the PLLC, and the \nuniversity, and will require a strong collaborative and coordinated relationship between \nthe PLLC and the partnering Faculties.  The PLLC recognizes that each of the Faculties \noffering a PLLC leadership course is ultimately responsible for the content, academic \noversight, governance approval, and delivery of that course.  The host Faculties see \nsignificant benefit from the active advisory engagement of the PLLC during course and \ncertificate development, as well as in an ongoing capacity. An Academic Oversight \nCommittee (AOC) will utilized to achieve the optimum collaborative benefit.  \nIII. The Leadership Role of the Peter Lougheed Leadership College \nAcademic Oversight Advisory Committee \nUtilizing a collaborative and collegial approach the AOC members will work with the PLLC \nadministrative unit to support the development of development and delivery of a superior \nquality embedded certificate, and its components, and the PLLC as an important multi-\ncampus initiative.  \nA key leadership role of the committee will be to utilize the combined governance \nexperience of its members to create clarity and consensus regarding the roles, \nrelationships and responsibilities pertaining to the development (including required \napprovals) and delivery of the courses and the overarching certificate. In undertaking this \nrole, the Committee recognizes that the host Faculties have ultimate responsibility for \ngovernance processes relating to the individual courses and certificate.  \nApril 21, 2016 \nThe Academic Oversight Committee (AOC) will: \n● Create and utilize a governance and academic oversight strategy to clarify roles, \nresponsibilities, and relationships that supports a two-way (PLLC and AOC) mentoring \nand learning process and a collaborative commitment to academic excellence.    \n● Seek ongoing input from the PLLC on course and certificate content; and \n● Work with the Faculties to ensure the courses are aligned, as much as possible, with \nPLLC values and principles. \nThe leadership efforts of the AOC will benefit four specific stakeholder groups:  \n● Students will benefit from an academically rigorous, enriching and valuable learning \nexperience that contributes to their academic program requirements, and provides \nopportunity for leadership development in an inter-disciplinary environment.  \n● The University of Alberta will benefit from the collaboration and synergies between \nthe PLLC and the academic community through: \no Provision of a program and experience that distinguishes the UofA in the \nfield of inter-disciplinary leadership development.   \no Development of governance protocols, principles and implementation \nprocesses that can serve as examples for other inter-disciplinary initiatives.  \n● The hosting Faculties will benefit from the work of the committee by: \no Increased clarity and broadly shared knowledge of the intentions of the PLLC \nand of the leadership certificate within that context;  \no Clarity of roles, relationships and responsibilities in certificate and course \ndevelopment, the required approvals, and program delivery; \no A shared confidence in the credibility of the academic certificate; \no Support and advice from the committee throughout the approval processes; \nand \no Leadership development opportunities through affiliation with the PLLC.  \n● The benefits to PLLC from working with the AOC committee will include: \no Having a cohesive, collaborative, and collegial academic body to support the \nPLLC certificate; \no Shared commitment to a strong, credible and valuable academic certificate; \no Shared and consistent communication to the academic community through a \nformal conduit which provides the ability to share the overall picture and \nintention of the PLLC and the leadership certificate—PLLC activities and \nvalues will be accurately represented to the academy; \no Strong and focussed relationships with the academic community;   \no Ability to further develop knowledge about UofA governance practices and \nimplementation by accessing the governance expertise from the committee \nmembers; and \nApril 21, 2016 \no Developing and sharing a model that can be used by other University \ninitiatives.  \ni. AOC Membership  \nThe membership of the AOC will consist of: \n● Vice Provost (Academic)  to serve as chair of the committee \n● PLLC representative \n● Representative from the Certificate Hosting Faculty \n● Associate Deans (Undergraduate Programs) or Dean’s designate from : \no Host Faculty Foundations of Leadership Course – Faculty of Arts \no Host Faculty Topics in Leadership Course – Faculty of ALES \no Host Faculty Experiential Workshops – Alberta School of Business  \no Host Faculty Capstone Course – Faculty of Science  \nii. AOC Operating Principles (Values and Principles of Practice)  \nValue: how the AOC will get \nto where it wants to go \nPrinciples of Practice that reflect  the  values \nStudent-based approach The PLLC and AOC will collaborate to serve the best interests of \nthe students in the provision of a superior academic experience   \nReflecting the PLLC \nmission and values \nConsider the PLLC values and principles in forming and \ndeveloping positions and providing advice.  \nCollaborative engagement The relationship is characterized by open, timely, complete and \ntransparent information exchange.    \nPLLC and the AOC will adopt, demonstrate and maintain a \ncommitment to the success of the PLLC and the academic \nprograms associated with the PLLC.  \nA solution/ outcomes-\nbased approach \nThe AOC and the PLLC will address concerns and issues by \nconfirming the shared, desired outcome and seeking the most \nfeasible and effective solution. \nA learning approach \nReflecting respect for the experience, knowledge and abilities of \nall stakeholders, the PLLC and AOC will actively and consciously \nengage in two-way mentoring and learning.   \nApril 21, 2016 \niii.

Roles and Responsibilities (scope) of the PLLC relevant to the PLLC certificate, courses and \ngovernance.  \n● The Principal of the PLLC holds ultimate responsibility for the vision and intention of all \ncollege activities. The Principal is responsible for the foundational principles of the \nleadership certificate and ensuring that its delivery is consistent with those principles.   \n● The Principal will seek the knowledge, expertise and advice of the AOC in service to the \ninitial and continual development of superior academic offerings that reflect the \nprinciples of the PLLC and high standards of pedagogy.  Specifically, the Principal will \nrefer to the expertise of the committee in matters of academic oversight and governance \napproval. \n● The PLLC will refer all matters relative to academic oversight and governance approval \nto the AOC for their consideration and advice.  \n● The PLLC recognizes that the oversight and governance of academic programs \nassociated with PLLC rests in the Faculties offering the courses and certificate.  \nvi. Term of the Committee  \nThe AOC will remain as a standing committee (and meet as required) for the purpose of \nworking with the PLLC to discuss changes in programming, and to engage with the PLLC as \npart of the process for evolution of the certificate program. \nvii. Decision Making and Dispute Resolution  \nThe AOC will operate using a consensus model.    \nIf consensus cannot be reached the matter will be referred to the Provost for a final decision. \nApril 21, 2016 \nAppendix I. AOC/PLLC Communication Guidelines \nThe AOC, in its work to support the development and delivery of high quality academic \nofferings as part of the PLLC Leadership Certificate, is a key PLLC partner.   Effective, timely \nand productive communication emanating from a respectful and collaborative relationship \nis essential. The following communication guidelines will guide formal communication \n(information requests or review) between the PLLC and the AOC.    \n● Consultation is required on all matters pertaining to the academic content of the \nproposed certificate, or matters that require approval(s) by University Governance \ncommittees. \n● For each matter, which requires a significant information exchange between the \nAOC and the PLLC, each partner will designate a conversation leader to coordinate a \ntimely and collective response.  \n● The intention or purpose of the information request, and the process timeline, will \nbe provided at the time of the request. (i.e.: whether simple advice, material review, \nor formal approval being requested, or whether discussions are required to arrive at \na mutually agreeable solution to a pending issue)  \n● When either the PLLC or AOC submits an issue for consideration by the other body, \nadvance notice of the forthcoming request with as much information available at \nthat time will be provided.  For instance, if the PLLC is requesting a document to be \nreviewed by the AOC, it will inform the AOC of this intention sufficiently in advance.  \n● A collective response will be provided within two working days of receipt (as a \ngeneral guideline). If this timeline cannot be met, notification will be provided \nimmediately and a delivery time will be agreed upon.   \n● This does not preclude holding developmental meetings or workshops between the \nPLLC and the AOC as necessary. \n● The communication loop will be closed by informing the other body how the \ninformation or response was used to inform the decision.  \nItem No. 7 \nGENERAL FACULTIES COUNCIL \nFor the Meeting of May 30, 2016 \nOUTLINE OF ISSUE \nAgenda Title: Proposal to Establish a Department of Critical Care Medicine and the Concurrent \nTermination of the Division of Critical Care Medicine, Faculty of Medicine and Dentistry \nMotion:  THAT General Faculties Council recommend that the Board of Governors approve the \nestablishment of a Department of Critical Care Medicine, as submitted by the Faculty of Medicine and \nDentistry,  and as set forth in Attachment 1, and the concurrent termination of the Division of Critical Care \nMedicine, to take effect July 1, 2016. \nItem \nAction Requested Approval Recommendation  Discussion/Advice Information \nProposed by Richard Fedorak, Interim Dean, Faculty of Medicine and Dentistry \nPresenter Richard Fedorak, Interim Dean, Faculty of Medicine and Dentistry \nSubject Proposed Establishment of a Department of Critical Care Medicine \nDetails \nResponsibility Provost and Vice-President (Academic) \nThe Purpose of the Proposal is \n(please be specific) \nTo transform the existing free standing Division of Critical Care Medicine \ninto a Department of Critical Care Medicine. The Division currently \noperates much like a Department, with a director who sits on the Faculty \nEvaluation Committee (for evaluation of its own members) and on the \nFaculty’s Chairs Committee. The Division has the responsibility for \nmanaging its own budget and teaching plan. We also recommend the \ncurrent division director become chair of the department. \nThe Impact of the Proposal is To strengthen the academic mission of the FOMD by removing \norganizational barriers to the further development of the academic critical \ncare medicine.  A resource-neutral move that both formalizes the status \nquo and allows the unit to respond to scholarly developments in the \nacademic field. It will also enhance recruitment and retention to compete \nagainst other Departments of Critical Care in the country.

King in 1970,\nwas one of the first of its kind. \n• In the mid 1980s, Dr. King and Dr. Tom Noseworthy were instrumental in the development of\nthe Critical Care Medicine training programs of the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of \nCanada (RCPSC).   \n• In 1989, the University of Alberta Critical Care Residency Program was one of the first to be\naccredited by the RCPSC. \n• In 2000, the Regional Program Clinical Director for Critical Care, Dr. Noel Gibney, was appointed\nas Divisional Director.  This allowed the academic Division and the clinical Department to merge \ntheir vision, mission and goals.  Faculty members could now hold a primary appointment in the \nDCCM and secondary appointments, if desired, in other departments. \n• In 2012, Alberta Health Services created Strategic Clinical Networks (SCNs). Aligned with the\nDepartmental structure of the AHS, critical care was one of the initial specialties to be \nrecognized with network foundation.  \nClinical \n• Critical Care units are becoming an increasing component of hospitalized care. A 2010 study\ndemonstrated the need for intensive care continues to increase. Over 5 years in the US there\nhas been a 4% decrease in the total number of hospital beds but an increase in ICU beds by 7%.\nHospital non-ICU inpatient days increased by 5% while ICU inpatient days increased by 10%.\nImportantly, annual critical care medicine costs increased by 44%. (Crit Care Med 2010, 38:65-\n71). It is expected the ratio of ICU beds to hospital beds will continue to rise.\n• The Division of Critical Care Medicine, University of Alberta/Department of Critical Care\nMedicine, Edmonton Zone, Alberta Health Sciences (DCCM) is (one of) the largest integrated\nacademic and clinical critical care units in Canada.\n• DCCM provides Intensivist coverage for 8 Critical Care Units (multisystem and specialized) in 5\nhospitals totaling 121 beds. The DCCM provides care for over 6500 patients per year (over\n37500 patient days). Thousands of hospitalized patients are seen by our Medical Emergency or\nRapid Response teams annually.\n• The DCCM has 50 members, of whom 36 have their primary academic appointment in the\nDCCM.  The DCCM is larger, in terms of members and Faculty, than the two current Canadian\nacademic Departments of Critical Care Medicine (Calgary and Dalhousie).\n• The DCCM has 9 primarily appointed Faculty members (5 GFT and 4 special continuing\nappointments). In addition, the Division has six GFT members secondarily appointed to Critical\nCare. With these 15 members, the DCCM is larger than 7 Departments in the FoMD based on\ndata provided in 2014.\nAttachment 3 - Page 1 of 2 1\nAttachment 4\n• The DCCM was successful in recruiting 2 additional special continuing status Faculty this year\nand will join the FoMD in 2015 and 2016. Finally, the DCCM has a translational anesthesiology\nbased Intensivist researcher in the Clinical Investigator Program and will join Faculty in 2018.\nThis will mean the proposed Academic Department will have 16 GFT/SCS members by 2018.\nResearch \n• The academic productivity of the proposed Department has increased steadily. In 2013, 79\nunique publications were documented by Divisional members. This increased to 94 in 2014. It is \nexpected 2015 will see over 100 unique publications \n• Since 2009, research activity in the DCCM has been successful in securing funding for the\nfollowing (mostly peer-reviewed) grant applications: Canadian Institutes for Health Research, \nAlberta Innovates: Health Solutions Alberta Heritage Fund for Medical Research), Canadian \nIntensive Care Foundation, Royal Alexandra Hospital Foundation, University of Alberta Hospital \nFoundation, Rick Hansen Foundation Man in Motion, Physician Services Incorporated, Children’s \nHospital of Eastern Ontario Research Institute, Royal Alexandra Hospital Nursing Research Fund, \nTransplant Fund Value Added, Canadian Blood Services, Edmonton Civic Employees Charitable \nAssistance Fund, Women and Children’s Health Research Institute Innovation Grant, Centre for \nExcellence for Gastrointestinal Inflammation and Immunity Research, and Royal Alexandra \nHospital Nursing Research Fund. Annual grant funding has increased from $443,129 in 2013 to \n$1,454,231 in 2015. \n• Dr. Sean Bagshaw, a clinician scientist and the Director of Research for the DCCM, holds a Tier II\nCanada Research Chair in Critical Care Nephrology. \nEducation \n• The DCCM operates an accredited 2 year RCPSC Adult Critical Care Medicine training program.\n• Currently training six residents that have already completed primary specialty\n• The program has recently been approved for growth of an additional resident per year.\n• The DCCM trains one or two international critical care residents a year in addition to the RCPSC\nresidency program trainees\n• The DCCM has developed a research fellowship for graduate training and a cardiac intensive\ncare fellowship (one and two year)\n• In addition, the training program is also responsible for providing Critical Care exposure of two\nto three months duration to approximately 125 residents from the Department of Surgery,\nMedicine and its subspecialties, Emergency Medicine, Anesthesia, Neurosciences,\nCardiovascular Surgery, Obstetrics and Gynecology as required by the RCPSC.\n• Graduate student supervision in health services research, clinical epidemiology, translational\nresearch is increasing.\nOther Significant Contributions to Society \n• Canadian Critical Care Society – End of Life Care, Goals of Care Designations\n• Canadian Critical Care Trials Group\n• DCCM is integral to Trauma Services, Burn Treatment, Cardiac Surgery, Neurosciences and\nDonation and Transplantation with U of A Hospital a referral centre for Western Canada\nAttachment 3 - Page 2 of 2 2\nAttachment 4 - Page 1 of 1 1\nAttachment 5\n1 \nAttachment 5 – Page 1 of 1 \nJonathan Davidow MD, FRCP(C) \n4228 10240 Kingsway Avenue, Edmonton, AB, T5H 3V9 \nSite Chief, Critical Care, Royal Alexandra Hospital \nAssociate Clinical Professor, University of Alberta \nMay 11, 16 \nDr. Richard Fedorak \nDean, Faculty of Medicine and Dentistry, \nUniversity of Alberta, \n2J2.01WC Mackenzie HSC \nEdmonton, AB  T6G 2R7 \nDear Dr. Fedorak, \nAs Site Chief of Critical Care at the Royal Alexandra Hospital, I am writing this letter to express my \nsupport of the Division of Critical Care Medicine’s application for Departmental status within the FoMD at \nthe University of Alberta.  Our site has a very active role in the education of residents from various \nspecialties and in training our own RCPSC Adult Critical Care Medicine residents, but we feel we have \nbeen underperforming with respect to academic productivity. \nOver the past year, we have successfully recruited an Otolaryngologist/Intensivist who is completing his \nMaster’s degree in Health Quality and an Aneasthesiologist/Intensivist who is completing her PhD in \nPhysiology in the Clinical Investigator Program. We have several impending retirements in the next 3-4 \nyears, and as we work on our strategic plan, we look to recruit towards our future goals of increasing our \nacademic productivity, particularly in the area of Health Quality research. I feel strongly that the graduation \nof our Division to Departmental status will give us a competitive advantage in recruiting individuals who \nwill help achieve these goals.  We are very grateful for your ongoing support of this process. \nSincerely, \nJonathan Davidow \nAttachment 6\n2-150S Clinical Sciences Building \nEdmonton, Alberta, Canada  T6G 2G3 \nTel:

This \nitem was discussed by the GFC Executive Committee who agreed that this is an important issue but that it \nwould benefit from a wider review.  As such, the GFC Executive Committee recommends a modification \nwhich extends the original motion to include not only the review of how USRIs might be modified, \naugmented, or possibly replaced, but also considers the development and implementation of a more robust \nsolution to teaching assessment and evaluation. \nMotion:  THAT the General Faculties Council, on the recommendation of the GFC Executive Committee, \nrequest that the GFC Committee on the Learning Environment report by 30 April 2017, on research into the \nuse of student rating mechanisms of instruction in university courses. This will be informed by a critical \nreview of the University of Alberta’s existing Universal Student Ratings of Instruction (USRIs) and their use \nfor assessment and evaluation of teaching as well as a broad review of possible methods of multifaceted \nassessment and evaluation of teaching. The ultimate objective will be to satisfy the Institutional Strategic \nPlan: For the Public Good strategy to: Provide robust supports, tools, and training to develop and assess \nteaching quality, using qualitative and quantitative criteria that are fair, equitable, and meaningful across \ndisciplines. \nItem   \nAction Requested Approval Recommendation  Discussion/Advice Information \nProposed by Steven Dew, Provost and Vice-President (Academic) \nPresenter Steven Dew, Provost and Vice-President (Academic) \nSubject Teaching and Learning and Teaching Evaluation and the use of the \nUniversal Student Ratings of Instruction (USRI) as an evaluative tool \nDetails \nResponsibility Provost and Vice-President (Academic) \nThe Purpose of the Proposal is \n(please be specific) \nThe Provost's Office supports the idea of examining the USRIs, but \nwould like to undertake this task with a broader consideration of how \nUSRIs might be modified, augmented, or possibly replaced over time.  \nSince the GFC Policy 111 specifies required use of the USRIs as a \nmeans of achieving instructor feedback from students, the USRIs cannot \nbe simply removed without a replacement. Additionally, as specified in \nthe GFC Policy 111, there must be multifaceted assessment and \nevaluation of teaching and while this exists in some areas, it is not being \ncarried out throughout the university.  Thus a broader approach to this \nproblem would support the development and implementation of a more \nrobust solution to teaching assessment and evaluation.  \nThe Impact of the Proposal is An examination of both the USRI and the need for multifaceted review of \nteaching will lead to rescission of the current GFC Policy 111 and \ncreation of a new UAPPOL policy to support teaching and learning and \nteaching assessment and evaluation. Recommendations on the \nrescission of the GFC Policy 111 and creation of new UAPPOL policy to \nsupport Teaching, Learning and Teaching Evaluation will come forward \nItem No. 9 \nGENERAL FACULTIES COUNCIL \nFor the Meeting of May 30, 2016 \nto GFC for approval.  \nReplaces/Revises (eg, policies, \nresolutions) \nN/A \nTimeline/Implementation Date April 30, 2017 \nEstimated Cost N/A \nSources of Funding N/A \nNotes Both GFC policy and collective agreements mandate that there must be \na student evaluation of teaching. Currently the USRI fills this role and it \ncould not be discontinued without an appropriate replacement.  \nAlignment/Compliance \nAlignment with Guiding \nDocuments \nInstitutional Strategic Plan: For the Public Good \n“OBJECTIVE: Inspire, model, and support excellence in teaching and learning.  \n[…] \niii.

GFC policy 111 Teaching and Learning and Teaching Evaluation \n“111.2 Teaching Evaluation  \n1. Evaluation of teaching at the University of Alberta serves two purposes: \na. Summative – Evaluation provides a review and overview of an instructor’s \nteaching that is an essential element in promotion and tenure decisions. In its \nsummative form, teaching evaluation forms a basis for rewarding excellence, as \nwell as the basis for withholding reward. \nb. Formative – Evaluation provides helpful feedback to teachers by identifying \nteaching strengths and weaknesses and, in so doing, giving guidance for the \nimprovement or refinement of teaching skills. \n2. Evaluation of teaching must be multifaceted. Multifaceted evaluation shall \ninclude the Universal Student Ratings of Instruction set out in Section 111.3 and \nother methods of assessing teaching designed within individual Faculties to \nrespond to the particular conditions of that Faculty. Such assessments shall \ninclude one or more of the following: input from administrators, peers, self, \nundergraduate and graduate students, and alumni. \n3. Recognizing that the evaluation of teaching at the University shall be \nmultifaceted, Faculty Evaluation Committee (FEC) decisions concerning tenure, \npromotion or unsatisfactory teaching performance must be based on more than \none indicator of the adequacy of teaching. \n4. Assessment of teaching involving input from administrators, peers, self, \nalumni, or undergraduate and graduate students in addition to the Universal \nStudent Ratings of Instruction should occur annually prior to tenure. For \ncontinuing faculty (ie, Categories A1.1, A1.5 and A1.6), such assessment will \noccur at least triennially.  \n5. The University shall continue to support University Teaching Services in its \neducation programming which is focused on the development and improvement \nof teaching and learning and its efforts to enhance research in university \nteaching. \n111.3 Universal Student Ratings of Instruction \nIn recognition of the University's commitment to teaching, the General Faculties \nItem No. 9 \nGENERAL FACULTIES COUNCIL \nFor the Meeting of May 30, 2016 \nCouncil endorses a system of Universal Student Ratings of Instruction. This \nsystem, however, is only one part of the multi-faceted approach described in \nSection 111.2. \nThe Universal Student Ratings of Instruction are administered electronically via a \nsystem known as the eUSRI system.   \nThe Universal Student Ratings of Instruction are designed to provide a minimal \nuniversity-wide base of information on student ratings to the parties listed in this \nSection. With this purpose in mind, the General Faculties Council adopts the \nfollowing policies: \nA. All Faculties will ensure that evaluation of all instructors and courses will take \nplace each time a course is offered. The term ‘instructors’ is meant to include \ntenured professors, tenure-track professors, sessional instructors, clinical \ninstructors, field supervisors and graduate teaching assistants with \nresponsibilities for courses. \n[…] \nD. The anonymity of student responses to the Universal Student Ratings of \nInstruction is of fundamental importance in maintaining student confidentiality \nand encouraging the free expression of views. Under normal circumstances, the \nanonymity of students will be protected. Universal Student Ratings of Instruction \noffer an avenue of feedback, including feedback critical of instructors. \n[…] \nG. The numerical summaries for the ten Universal Student Ratings of Instruction \nquestions will be reported to the instructor, the Chair, Director or Dean and \nstudents. \n[…] \nI. All results given out to students, Chairs, Directors and Deans will have the \nfollowing cautionary preface: \nStudent questionnaires form an important part of evaluating teaching \neffectiveness but cannot be taken alone as a complete assessment of an \ninstructor or course. Factors other than an instructor’s teaching ability may \ninfluence ratings. These factors include class size, class level, Faculty, time in \nclass, required versus optional course, grade expectations, student GPA, \ngender, race, ethnicity, age of both students and instructors. \n[…] \nJ. Nothing in this section will prevent instructors from seeking other means of \nfeedback from students during the term.” \nThe full GFC Policy 111 Teaching and Learning and Teaching Evaluation is \navailable at: \nhttp://www.gfcpolicymanual.ualberta.ca/111TeachingandLearningandTeach.aspx \n5.

During the intervening years there \nhave been a great many changes to the academy; and during the last few years, the last year or so especially, \nthere have been many reports on research into such instruments that suggest that they tend to function in \ninequitable and even discriminatory ways. I would therefore very much like to see the General Faculties \nCouncil's Committee on the Learning Environment review this research and report on it to GFC, and to provide \nat that time its recommendations for any changes to the USRIs that would be appropriate or indeed necessary \nif the General Faculties Council is to continue to endorse their use.  \nTiming of Request \nI put this forward motion now rather than in the Fall for two reasons: so that the expertise of any member of the \nCLE whose term may be ending at June 30th may be captured on this issue to assist with the committee's work \nnext year; and to assist the University in getting out ahead of a policy document that is scheduled to come \nforward to the Council of the Canadian Association of University Teachers (CAUT) in the Fall. I would like the \nGeneral Faculties Council to be positioned to take an informed decision next year on what about our current \nUSRIs would need to change if the GFC were to continue to endorse them. \nIt is my understanding that there was some work done by the Committee on the Learning Environment on this \nfront six years ago in 2010, but it is time for the committee to do further work on this issue in light of the \nresearch on these instruments that has emerged during the last couple of years. Only with that work can the \nGeneral Faculties Council proceed to informed decision-making on this important matter. \nYours sincerely, \nCarolyn \n--  \nCarolyn Sale \nAssociate Professor, Department of English & Film Studies \nVice-President, Association of Academic Staff University of Alberta (AASUA) \n3-77 Humanities Centre \nEdmonton, Alberta \nCanada T6G 2E5 \nPhone:   Apologies: none due to budget cuts to the Faculty of Arts in 2009-2010. \nFax:       780.492.8142 \nBlog:      artssquared.wordpress.com \nmailto:sale@ualberta.ca\nmailto:dturpin@ualberta.ca\ntel:780.492.8142\nhttp://artssquared.wordpress.com/\nItem No. 10 \nGENERAL FACULTIES COUNCIL \nFor the Meeting of May 30, 2016 \nOUTLINE OF ISSUE \nAgenda Title: Proposal for a new Scheduling Initiative for Augustana Faculty  \nMotion:  N/A  \nItem   \nAction Requested Approval Recommendation  Discussion/Advice Information \nProposed by Dr. Allen Berger, Dean, Augustana Faculty \nPresenter Dr. Allen Berger, Dean, Augustana Faculty; Dr. Karsten Mündel, \nAssociate Dean, Academic, Augustana Faculty \nSubject New Scheduling Initiative for Augustana Faculty \nDetails \nResponsibility Provost and Vice-President (Academic) \nThe Purpose of the Proposal is \n(please be specific) \nAs a residential, undergraduate, liberal arts and science faculty within \nthe University of Alberta, the Augustana Campus places a special value \non community-based education, international and outdoor educational \nexperiences, undergraduate research and connections to rural and \nAboriginal communities. In this context, the proposed new framework \nserves a dual-purpose vision: 1) to provide a rhythm for each academic \nyear that advances experiential learning opportunities for students, \nconnections between these opportunities and more traditional classroom \nwork, and pedagogical innovation by faculty; 2) to create a clearer niche \nfor Augustana and further differentiate the undergraduate student \nexperience at Augustana from alternatives on North Campus or at other \nAlberta universities. \nThe Impact of the Proposal is Apart from the above, the proposed Augustana Scheduling Initiative \ncould potentially address:  \n-student workload issues: particularly important for student mental \nhealth challenges that are increasingly recognized as critical;  \n-faculty workload issues: particularly the need to accommodate \nresearch expectations in a predominantly teaching Faculty;  \n-greater flexibility in degree completion times: especially with the \nopportunity to complete a *3 course in September or January;  \n-development of a first-year seminar: understood across North \nAmerica to be a “high-impact practice”, this mandatory “First Year \nExperience” course (proposed as AUIDS 101) will be a small seminar-\nstyle course for new students beginning studies at Augustana Faculty in \nthe September or January 3-weeks course period;  \n-provide opportunities for first and second-year students to \n‘sample’ courses: the 3-week course period means students commit \nless time to an interest that may or may not result in a change of major \nor minor, and give a ‘short-term’ opportunity to explore other subject \nareas;  \n-ability to accommodate students’ varying learning styles: this \ncomes with the flexibility to present different learning methods within a 3 \nor 11 week course, as well as potentially over two or more of these \ncomponents in the academic schedule;  \nReplaces/Revises (eg, policies, \nresolutions) \nUniversity Calendar 52.2, 52.3, 52.4, 55.4. \nTimeline/Implementation Date September 2017 \nEstimated Cost N/A \nItem No. 10 \nGENERAL FACULTIES COUNCIL \nFor the Meeting of May 30, 2016 \nSources of Funding Existing resources.

SHORT INFORMATON SUMMARY REGARDING '3-11' \nWhat Is It? \nOn May 4, 2015, the Augustana Faculty Council, after two years of study and with an overall \nmajority of 89%, passed the following motion: \n“THAT the Augustana Faculty implement, effective 2017-18, a new academic schedule with \nthe Fall and Winter semesters each consisting of a 3-week term followed by an 11-week \nterm and adopt a new timetable for the 11-week terms as outlined in Schedule A, and \ninvestigate the feasibility of an additional 3-week block term in the spring.” \nVision \nAs a residential, undergraduate, liberal arts and science faculty within the University of \nAlberta, the Augustana Campus places a special value on community-based education, \ninternational and outdoor educational experiences, undergraduate research and \nconnections to rural and aboriginal communities. In this context, the 3-11 framework \nserves a dual-purpose vision: 1) to provide a rhythm for each academic year that advances \nexperiential learning opportunities for students, connections between these opportunities \nand more traditional classroom work, and pedagogical innovation by faculty; 2) to create a \nclearer niche for Augustana and further differentiate the undergraduate student experience \nat Augustana from alternatives on North Campus or at other Alberta universities. \nBackground \nSeveral undergraduate universities (e.g., Quest University in Canada; Colorado College and \nCornell College in the U.S.) have organized the entire undergraduate experience on a block \ncalendar in which students take one course at a time and faculty only teach one course at a \ntime. Other universities have traditionally placed courses into 10-11 week quarters instead \nof 13-15 week semesters. Based on personal experiences that Augustana faculty members \nhave had with both systems and the visit of a delegation to Quest University, we have \ndecided on a hybrid approach that we believe offers significant advantages and flexibility. \nAdditional Benefits \nThe new academic calendar and timetable also offer opportunities to address: student \nworkload issues (particularly important for student mental health challenges that are \nincreasingly recognized as critical); faculty workload issues (particularly the need to \naccommodate research expectations in a predominantly teaching Faculty); the need for \nmore flexibility in degree completion times; the possibility of developing a first-year \nseminar, understood across North America to be a “high-impact practice;” the need to \nprovide opportunities for first and second-year students to ‘sample’ courses (i.e., to \ncommit less time to an interest that may or may not result in a change of major); the \nchallenge of how to accommodate students’ varying learning styles; and Augustana’s \nrelated goals of enrolment and revenue growth (the latter not only determined by the \nnumber of degree-seeking students but also by the number of community members who \nmay be interested in taking, and paying for, 3-week courses).  \n 3 \nOrganization of Implementation \nAugustana recognizes that implementation of these changes will require the support of \npartners within the central University of Alberta administration, including key personnel in \nthe Registrar’s Office and the Office of the Provost. Preliminary conversations with \nRegistrar Lisa Collins have helped identify the likely players. In addition, Augustana has \ncreated a 3-11 Task Force that includes representatives from all academic departments, \nstudent services and the Augustana Students’ Association. Leadership will be provided by \nVice Dean Anne-Marie Link and Associate Dean Academic Karsten Mündel. Other faculty \nand staff will be brought in as necessary to help work out specific details related to \nimplementation. Significant work will also be done within our three Department Councils. \nTimeline \nThe motion passed by the Augustana Faculty Council envisions two years for preparation, \nwith roll-out for the 2017/18 Academic Year. Most of the logistical, policy, and procedural \nwork of implementation must be completed by July 2016 for calendar and recruitment \nmaterials to accurately reflect the new Augustana realities. An important first task of \nimplementation, therefore, is collectively to work backwards from that date to establish the \ndeadlines for the various subtasks outlined below. \nKey Tasks \nThe work of implementation at this point falls into three overlapping categories. The \nfollowing list is presented as a starting point for our work with Central partners, \nrecognizing that other tasks will be added as a result of initial planning discussions.  \nNew Timetable \nAdoption of the 3-11 academic schedule requires us to adopt a new timetable for both the \n3-week and 11-week course periods. The timetable for 3-week courses will be relatively \neasy to implement, as traditional courses will be scheduled for approximately 3 hours per \nday with morning, afternoon and evening timeslots. The 11-week schedule ensures that \nthere will be the same number of instructional minutes in an 11-week term as in the \ncurrent 13-week term. \nNew Academic Schedule \n● setting up Campus Solutions to deal with the course schedule structure at \nAugustana \n● changes to relevant academic procedures and regulations in relation to the schedule \nand timetable changes (the group will need to create early on a full list of these \nprocedures and regulations) \nAugustana Tasks \nWe recognize that a series of Augustana-specific tasks need to take place in advance of the \n3-11 start date. These include: work on relevant promotional and recruitment materials; \ninvestments in faculty development; curriculum revisions; development of a First Year \nExperience seminar course for the first three-week course period as a pilot project.  \n 4 \nII.  BACKGROUND \nA Learning Experience Research Committee (LERC) was convened after the Augustana \nFaculty Council meeting of October 2013 to research and consider alternative learning \nexperience opportunities that might be implemented at Augustana Campus and to produce \na specific proposal for an alternative learning experience that reflects the values and \nculture of learning at Augustana. The point of producing a specific proposal was to facilitate \na substantive discussion in the Faculty.  Following this substantive discussion and \nconsultation [SEE BELOW], the proposal, which was to become known as '3-11' was \nsubsequently passed with an 89% majority at the Augustana Faculty Council meeting in \nMay 2015.   \nRationale for Proposal  \nA. The proposal was guided by the values and culture of learning articulated in The \nAugustana Faculty Academic Performance Measures (December 2012) and by the evaluation \nand recommendations of the Academic Unit Review of the Augustana Faculty (2011) since  \n(1) both reports have been accepted by the Augustana Faculty and University of Alberta  \n(2) the self-description of Augustana in The Augustana Faculty Academic Performance \nMeasures was a supplement to the Academic Measures for Budgeting Process 2013-14 \ndistributed by the Office of the Provost and as such is used to determine budget allocations \nto Augustana  \nB. This proposal aimed to strengthen the three characteristics that are unique to Augustana \n(according to The Augustana Faculty Academic Performance Measures):  \n(1) International Experiences  \n(2) Community-Based Learning  \n(3) Rural Connectedness  \nIn all three areas, the intention is to increase both the number of participating students and \nthe number of courses in each area.  \nC. The proposal also aimed to implement specific recommendations from the Academic Unit \nReview:  \n(1) to “push ahead confidently in making programming even more distinctive than is \nalready the case” by “strengthening and extending the core curriculum”;  \n(2) expand opportunities for “undergraduate research and creative work”;  \n(3) focus on “the liberal education provided to students regardless of major,” particularly \nwith regards to international experiences, community-based learning, and rural \nconnectedness.  \nD. The proposed learning experiences are high-impact practices that have all been tried \nand successfully implemented at one or more COPLAC institutions. This evidence suggests \nthat these practices could also work at Augustana if tailored to our specific situation. \nMoreover, the specific learning experiences in the proposal are constructed to meet current \nstudent needs (such as greater flexibility). \nThe \"3-11\" calendar was the major component of the resulting proposal, along with a First \nYear Experience. \n 5 \nThe objective of 3-11 is to provide students and faculty with more flexibility as well as to \nfacilitate unique experiential learning opportunities. Augustana could institute a 3 week course \nperiod at the beginning of the Fall and/or Winter term followed by an 11 week course period.  \nThese 3 and 11 week courses are accommodated within the existing Fall and Winter terms \nof the University of Alberta and do not change the number of contact hours, number of \ncourses taken by students over each term (normally 5) or number of courses taught by \nfaculty (normally 3).  \n 6 \nIII.  FACULTY CONSULTATION RE:  3-11 CALENDAR \nThe change to the 3-11 Calendar system formed the major part of the LERC proposal.   \nThe LERC committee consisted of representatives from all three academic departments and \nfrom the Augustana Students Association.  In the 2014-15 academic year it organized \ndiscussions regarding 3-11 at departmental meetings, at Faculty Council meetings and a series \nof formal consultations with faculty and staff.  The formal consultation dates are listed here: \n6 January          noon - 1:30         \n13 January       noon - 1:30          \n20 January       noon - 1:30 \n27 January       noon - 1:30  \n2 February      12:30 – 2:00              \n2 March            12:30 – 2:00              \n10 March          noon - 1:30          \n24 March          noon - 1:30            \n13 April            noon - 1:30  \nThere were between ten and twenty participants at the consultations outside Faculty \nCouncil meetings and departmental meetings. \nThe Faculty Council met in May 2015 to review, discuss and consider the material brought forth \nby the LERC committee and the results of its consultations.  The following motion was \nsubsequently put before the Faculty Council: \nTHAT the Augustana Faculty implement, effective 2017-18, a new academic \nschedule with the Fall and Winter semesters each consisting of a 3-\nweek term followed by an 11-week term and adopt a new timetable for \nthe 11-week terms as outlined in Schedule A, and investigate the \nfeasibility of an additional 3-week block term in the spring.  \nThe procedure for voting was that of a 'Super Majority', a decision-making procedure that had \nbeen voted on and carried at the December 1, 2014 meeting of the Faculty Council. This \nrequired that the motion for implementation of 3-11 needed to attain both a simple majority in \neach academic department followed by a two-thirds majority of YES votes at Faculty Council in \nwhich all members were to vote (faculty members, APOs, student representatives). \nThe majorities were achieved in all departments and an 89% YES vote was achieved at the \nFaculty Council meeting of May 2015. \nDuring that meeting, an Implementation Committee was constituted, which consists of \nrepresentatives from all academic departments, from the ASA, and from Residence \nLife/Student Services. \nConsultation continues as a major focus of the Implementation Committee. \n 7 \nIV.  FAQ \nStudent FAQ \n1) Why is Augustana doing this? \nAfter more than 2 years of consultation with students, faculty and staff, about \nways to improve the Augustana Advantage, we decided to implement a new \nacademic calendar and a First Year Experience. The new calendar will introduce \ngreater flexibility and foster the development of new experiential, travel and \nlearning opportunities. The First Year Experience will give students a seminar \nexperience in their first year to introduce them to learning in a Liberal Arts \ncontext. \n2) How does the new Augustana Academic Calendar work? \nThe Fall Term will consist of a 3-week course period in which students would take \n1 course followed by an 11-week course period in which students would take 4 \ncourses. The Winter Term would also have a 3-week course period and an \n11-week course period. There will be an increasing effort to also offer courses in a \nSpring 3-week course period. \n3) What is the implementation timeline? \nThe new academic calendar and First Year Experience will come into effect for the \n2017-18 academic year. The whole Augustana Campus will adopt the new \ncalendar. Students starting in the 2017-18 academic year will take the First Year \nSeminar class. \n4) Will I still be able to graduate in 4 years? \nAbsolutely! Students will still be able to take 5 courses in the Fall and Winter \nTerms and therefore be able to graduate in 4 years. As we increase our course \nofferings in the Spring and Summer Terms, students will also be able to pick up \nadditional courses to introduce greater flexibility into their schedules. \n5) What is the Augustana First Year Experience? \nThe Augustana First Year Experience is specifically designed to help students to \nmake the transition to university life and learning in a Liberal Arts context. There \nare two key components: a) the new student orientation and b) the Augustana \nFirst Year Seminar (FYS). The FYS will explore a specific topic in a small \nseminar-style setting. Students will be exposed to small-group discussion and will \nexplore a topic from a variety of academic disciplines and viewpoints. The new \nstudent orientation will work with the non-academic aspects of the transition to \nuniversity life. \n 8 \n6) What do I need to do to maintain full­time status in the new Augustana \nAcademic Calendar? \nFull-time status will continue to be a minimum of 9 credits per Term. Students have the \nflexibility to choose where in the Term to take their courses (for example, they could take \n3 credits in the 3-week course period and 6 credits in the 11-week course period). As is \ncurrently the case, specific scholarships and sponsorships may require a greater number \nof credits to maintain eligibility. In any case, the number of credits will be calculated at the \nTerm level (and not the block level). \n7) What kinds of 3­week courses will be offered in the fall and winter? \nThere will be a variety of courses offered in all 3-week course periods. These 3-week \ncourses will take advantage of the different time frame and the fact that students and \nprofessors are not involved in any other courses at the same time. \n8) Can I take September or January off? \nOne of the advantages of the new Academic Calendar is the choice it provides for \nscheduling. So, yes, you may be able to build an academic schedule that does not have any \nclasses in September or January for some of the Terms of your academic career at \nAugustana. However, depending on your major and other components of your academic \nprogram, it may be more challenging to complete your degree in 4 years if you take a \nbreak in September or January. \n9) Can I transfer my courses from Augustana to other universities? \nNone of the changes we are making to the academic schedule will impact the \ntransferability of these courses to other institutions. As at present, not all courses will \nalways transfer to a given program in a given receiving institution. Students are always \nadvised to check with a receiving institution about transferability. \n10) Are there any impacts on costs? \nNo. The costs for courses will continue to be calculated in the same manner as they are \nnow. Augustana will continue to follow the same fee assessment schedule as it currently \ndoes. Residence fees will continue to be assessed on a Term basis. \n11) Will my transcript look the same as it does now? \nYes. The transcripts will continue to look the same as they do now, listing courses by term \ntaken. \nDo you have other questions? Please contact Sarah Ross in the Dean’s Office  \nross3@ualberta.ca and she will find you an answer (and include it here in the FAQ). \nmailto:ross3@ualberta.ca\n 9 \nStaff FAQ \n1. How does the new Augustana Academic Calendar work? \nThe Fall Term will consist of a 3-week course period in which students would take 1 \ncourse and an 11-week course period in which students would take 4 courses. The Winter \nTerm would also have a 3-week course period and 11-week course period. There will be \nan increasing effort to offer courses in a Spring 3-week course period. \n2. What is the implementation timeline? \nThe new academic calendar are First Year Experience will come into effect for the \n2017-18 academic year. The whole Augustana Campus will adopt the new calendar. \nStudents starting in the 2017-18 academic year will take the First Year Seminar class. \n3. How do I raise issues related to the impact of the new Academic Calendar on \nmy work?  \nThe first person to ask is your direct manager.  Additionally, Anne-Marie and Karsten are \nscheduling meetings with every unit on campus during the Fall Term. Those meetings will \nbe a further chance to ask questions about the impact of these changes on your work \nrhythms. \n4. How does full-time status work in the new Augustana Academic Calendar? \nFull-time status will continue to be 9 credits per Term. Students have the flexibility to \nchoose where in the Term to take their courses (for example, they could take one course in \nthe 3-week course period and 2 courses in the 11-week course period). As is currently the \ncase, specific scholarships and sponsorships may require a greater number of credits to \nmaintain eligibility. In any case, the number of credits will be calculated at the Term level \n(and not the period of weeks in which the course occurs). \nDo you have other questions?

There \nare a smaller number of additional 3-week courses \navailable at the start of the standard University Spring \nTerm.  This schedule creates a potential annual student \nacademic enrollment cycle of 3-11-3-11-3. Students \ntypically register in a single *3 course in the 3-week \nperiod and a combination of courses totalling *12 \nduring the 11-week period. \n52.2      The Augustana Core \n{…no further changes in this section…} \n52.3     The Augustana Core \n{…no further changes in this section…} \n52.3 General Program Information \n The following terms, definitions, and \nabbreviations are used throughout the Augustana \nFaculty section of the Calendar. \n(1)  Unit of Course Weight: A unit of course weight \nindicates the instructional credit assigned to a course \nand is designated by the symbol after the course \nnumber and name.

Overall, this report confirms what our everyday interactions with graduate students \nsuggest: that our programs are attractive (application rates have traditionally been high), our \nstudents are strong (consistently showing high admission GPAs), our support systems are \nworking (the attrition rate rarely exceeds 20%), and our supervision is conscientious (our time to \ncompletion is stable, and competitive with Canadian and American averages).   \nGraduate recruitment, admission and enrolment are highly decentralized. Our 7500 graduate \nstudents work in over 300 research areas with 250 official specializations. The Faculty of \nGraduate Studies and Research exerts a centripetal force in this context, and is in a prime \nposition to collate disparate data and connect local to national and international trends. By its \nnature, this report looks to the past: five to ten years, depending on the availability and reliability \nof data. The historical knowledge it offers will allow us to chart the right course for the future. \nAmong the important insights contained here: after a decade of growth, doctoral enrolments \nmay be softening, particularly in Arts and Science. Since PhD enrolment is closely tied to the \nsize of the professoriate and to available research dollars, both of which have stalled, this \nmakes sense. (Anecdotal evidence suggests this is a national trend.) On the other hand, \ndemand for course-based Master’s programs continues to surge. The Province of Alberta does \nnot have a specific designation for Professional Master’s programs, but a deeper dive into the \nenrolment data presented here might support the call for such a distinction. The information on \ntime to completion demonstrates that international students complete their degrees more quickly \nthan do domestic students (including Permanent Residents). Attrition rates are highest in thesis-\nbased programs. The cost – to students and to the institution – of doctoral non-completion is \nhigh, and deserves further thought. The number of First Nations, Métis and Inuit (FNMI) \napplicants and students is very low. If the University identifies FNMI recruitment as a strategic \ngoal, special consideration must be given to bringing those students into graduate programs. \nA few notes on data and methodology: all graduate enrolment data is expressed in terms of \nheadcount rather than Full Load Equivalent (FLE). Headcount is the only reliable way to count \ngraduate students, since the FLE calculation over-estimates the number of students, due to a \nchanging denominator (number of credits). Wherever possible, we have used the December 1st \nheadcount, which provides the most accurate snapshot, capturing all of the students who start \ntheir studies in September and excluding everyone who completes their program during the fall \nsemester. However, even the December 1st headcount is only a snapshot: in a minority of \nFaculties, there can be a significant influx of students during the other semesters, and that will \nnot be captured here. \nWherever possible, we have used the University of Alberta data warehouse as our statistical \nsource. For some of the more historical analysis, however, we have used in-house FGSR \nfigures. These figures do not always square with one another. In future editions, we will be able \nto rely on the data warehouse exclusively, solving the problem of inconsistency.  \nYour comments and questions – about this report or its successors – are very welcome. One \nelement that we know would be welcome is benchmarking to national and international \nstandards. Frustratingly, much of the comparative data is privacy-protected or out of date; we \nhope that future enrolment reports will provide more comparative data.  \n3 \nI must close with a note of appreciation for my predecessor, Dr. Mazi Shirvani, who compiled a \ngreat deal of data concerning graduate students in his seven years as Dean of the Faculty. I \nalso appreciate the contributions of Deborah Williams, Gurpinder Gandhara and Denise Giles. \nOf course, I accept responsibility for any shortcomings. \nFGSR welcomes the opportunity to be a key partner in strategic enrolment management and \npresents this report with great pride. \nHeather Zwicker, PhD \nInterim Vice-Provost and Dean, Faculty of Graduate Studies and Research \n3 February 2016 \n4 \n1. Enrolment \nIn this section, all numbers are the standard December 1st headcounts, as reported to Statistics \nCanada and the provincial government.  \nVariation in graduate enrolment from one academic year to the next is due to three independent \nfactors. The number increases by the total number of new registrations, and it decreases by \nthe number of those leaving, through convocation or through attrition (see section 3). As an \naggregate measure, enrolment variations have to be understood with reference to the changes \nin these three factors. \nIt is also worth noting that this enrolment figure is a point-in-time snapshot, and does not show \nthe total number of graduate students who have been on campus at various points during the \nyear. (December 1st headcounts are a snapshot of the Fall Term registrations only.)  \n1.1 Graduate Enrolment by Degree Type \nThis graph demonstrates the overall increase in graduate enrolment over the last decade: from \n6541 (2511 doctoral +2111 Master’s thesis-based +1919 Master’s course-based) to 7228 (2777 \ndoctoral + 1966 Master’s thesis-based +2408 Master’s course-based). The largest increase has \nbeen in course-based Master’s programs, suggesting that an appetite for Professional Master’s \nprograms is strong. \nSource: FGSR Statistics & Strategic Analysis and Data Warehousing, Enrolment Management Report – January 7, \n2016 \n2511 \n2610 \n2693 \n2770 \n2944 \n2862 \n2937 \n3066 3019 2975 \n2777 \n2111 2109 2165 \n2212 \n2350 \n2,183 2,200 2,207 2,217 \n2,128 \n1966 1919 1964 \n2177 \n2343 \n2568 \n2,209 \n2,272 2,255 \n2,360 2,391 \n2408 \n1800\n2000\n2200\n2400\n2600\n2800\n3000\n3200\nHe\nad\nco\nun\nt \nAcademic Year \nDoctoral Master's Thesis - Based Master's Course-Based\n5 \n1.2 Graduate Enrollment – Fall Headcount for Doctoral Degree by Faculty  \nSource: Strategic Analysis and Data Warehousing, Enrolment Management Report – January 7, 2016 \nFaculty 2010-2011 2011-2012 2012-2013 2013-2014 2014-2015 2015-2016 \nALES 219 215 245 235 237 230 \nArts 458 463 472 478 451 413 \nBusiness 61 53 59 61 51 45 \nEducation 270 291 296 291 295 257 \nEngineering 610 666 717 702 711 678 \nExtension       \nFaculte Saint-Jean       \nFaculty of Native \nStudies       \nLaw 4 8 8 8 7 7 \nMedicine and \nDentistry 281 303 319 316 340 342 \nNursing 80 74 69 63 68 64 \nPharmacy 38 34 34 33 32 32 \nPhysical Educ. & \nRecreation 65 62 60 65 55 56 \nPublic Health 40 42 42 43 45 50 \nRehabilitation \nMedicine 33 34 36 38 36 37 \nScience 703 692 709 686 646 566 \nTotal 2862 2937 3066 3019 2975 2777 \n6 \n1.3 Graduate Enrollment – Fall Headcount for Master’s Degree by Faculty  \nSource: Strategic Analysis and Data Warehousing, Enrolment Management Report – January 7, 2016 \n  2010-2011 2011-2012 2012-2013 2013-2014 2014-2015 2015-2016 \nFaculty M-C M-T Total M-C M-T Total M-C M-T Total M-C M-T Total M-C M-T Total M-C M-T Total \nALES 14 260 274 18 248 266 14 249 263 26 258 284 22 261 283 22 244 266 \nArts 123 331 454 134 346 480 114 313 427 105 311 416 105 269 374 90 240 330 \nBusiness 430  430 447  447 449  449 499  499 544 1 545 558  558 \nEducation 446 89 535 523 99 622 499 97 596 496 85 581 547 80 627 568 70 638 \nEngineering 375 483 858 304 491 795 189 496 685 148 566 714 93 545 638 36 527 563 \nExtension 51 1 52 59 1 60 58 2 60 49 2 51 54 1 55 55  55 \nFaculté Saint-\nJean 34 16 50 37 18 55 30 20 50 24 16 40 16 13 29 21 8 29 \nLaw 2 6 8 5 5 10 1 8 9 2 6 8  4 4  5 5 \nMedicine and \nDentistry 4 270 274 2 287 289 2 277 279 2 265 267  281 281 2 260 262 \nNative \nStudies       1 7 8  10 10  7 7  12 12 \nNursing 42 44 86 44 28 72 39 43 82 45 33 78 49 29 78 47 20 67 \nPharmacy   22 22  25 25  21 21  13 13  17 17  18 18 \nPhysical \nEduc. & \nRecreation \n9 58 67 14 59 73 15 64 79 16 57 73 18 49 67 19 44 63 \nPublic Health 122 88 210 132 91 223 135 95 230 149 99 248 144 100 244 131 80 211 \nRehabilitation \nMedicine 496 42 538 499 38 537 621 37 658 708 41 749 709 39 748 748 48 796 \nScience 61 473 534 54 464 518 88 478 566 91 455 546 90 432 522 111 390 501 \nTotal 2,209 2,183 4,392 2,272 2,200 4,472 2,255 2,207 4,462 2,360 2,217 4,577 2,391 2,128 4,519 2,408 1,966 4,374 \nM-C = Master’s Course-Based, M-T = Master’s Thesis-Based \nThis table demonstrates a steady increase in enrolments in course-based Master’s degrees. \nThis may be because of increasing interest – on the part of students and on the part of the \nuniversity – in professional Master’s degrees.

Although sponsored \nstudents represent only about 5% of international graduate students, it is a segment of the \nstudent population that has grown. \nAlmost 70% of sponsored students have been in doctoral programs. The duration of \nsponsorships has been between one and six years, although the majority of them last three or \nfour years.  \n 2009-2010 2010-2011 2011-2012 2012-2013 2013-2014 2014-2015 Total \nChina 18 28 29 39 27 49 190 \nSaudi Arabia 26 17 18 24 13 18 116 \nMexico 14 15 4 9 4 6 52 \nVietnam 4 7 8 4 5 2 30 \nLibya 0 5 0 3 5 10 23 \nBrazil 0 1 2 3 1 9 16 \nChile 3 4 6 2 1 0 16 \nColombia 2 2 3 2 3 4 16 \nKazakhstan 2 6 1 3 2 0 14 \nPakistan 7 1 4 2 0 0 14 \nEgypt 6 1 0 1 1 2 11 \nThe China Scholarship Council (CSC) is one of our most important sponsoring partners. \nAccording to a CSC report from 2013, University of Alberta is their top global partner.2 This is a \nvaluable connection, but we must keep an eye on the trend, since we do not want to risk \nbuilding on a narrow base. Other partners include the King Abdullah Scholarship Program, \nColfuturo, the Vietnam Ministry of Education and Training, Ministry of Higher Education of \nEgypt, and the Canadian Commonwealth Scholarship Program. \n1 There were 106 sponsored students reported in the first year of the program (2008-2009), but we have not completed the \nverification of their status. \n2 Since fall 2012, FGSR has paid the domestic tuition and non-instructional fees for all new winners of the four-year CSC doctoral \nscholarships, and the Provost’s Office has paid the international differential tuition for these students. \n10 \n1.7 Enrolment by Gender \nThe graphs below also include students registered in graduate certificate and diplomas in \naddition to the three degree program types offered.

As the following table \nshows, FNMI students are particularly interested in course-based Master’s programs. \nEnrolment \nSource: FGSR Statistics \n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\n120\n140\nHe\nad\nco\nun\nt \nAcademic Year \nApplications Applicants Admitted Applicants Registered\n0\n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\n60\n70\nHe\nad\nco\nun\nt \nAcademic Year \nDoctoral Master's Thesis-Based Master's Course-Based\n13 \n2. Applications and Admissions \nFollowing a fairly rapid rise for several years, the number of applicants for admission3  has been \ndeclining since the 2012-2013 academic year, in both the domestic and the international \napplicant pools. Expanding the pool of qualified applicants is a component of active recruitment \nstrategies. \nThe yield rate (the percentage of registrations resulting from offers of admission) has been \nextremely steady, at about two thirds. Increasing the yield rate is another component of active \nrecruitment strategies. \nWe have an extremely diverse pool of international applicants, which has resulted in one of the \nmost international graduate student populations in the country (on par with UBC). This is \nparticularly true at the doctoral level. At the same time, however, we have observed a decline in \nthe number of domestic doctoral applicants, contrary to the national trend. An effective domestic \ndoctoral recruitment strategy is one option for reversing this trend. \nBy contrast, international applicants remain a relatively small part of the applicant pool for our \ncourse-based Master’s programs – contrary to much of the commentary concerning the \nattractiveness of these programs to international students. Marketing and promotion of our \ncourse-based Master’s programs may be necessary as the University proceeds with the \ndevelopment of new programs. \nExpanding the pool of qualified First Nations, Métis, and Inuit (FNMI) applicants requires careful \nplanning and recruitment strategies.  \nThere is gender imbalance in the number of applications for different degrees, with doctoral \nprograms attracting almost twice as many male as female applicants, while the proportion is \nalmost reversed for course-based Master’s programs. Female applicants tend to have a higher \nyield rate than their male counterparts. \n3 Our institutional graduate admission requirements are having a degree equivalent to a U of A baccalaureate degree, having an \nadmission GPA of at least 3.0, and a reasonable English Language Proficiency score if from an institution where the main language \nof instruction was not English. Numerous programs set higher standards. At the same time, programs can waive some of the \nstandards for a particular applicant in the light of other circumstances.  \n14 \n2.1 Graduate Admissions \nThe following graph shows the total number4 of applications for admission to graduate \nprograms, the number of offers of admissions made, and the number of subsequent \nregistrations. (Please note some applicants may have submitted more than one application.)  \nSource: FGSR Statistics \nAnecdotal evidence suggests that the trend at University of Alberta – a peak in 2012-13 leading \nto a period of decline – is consistent with national trends, particularly at the PhD level. However, \nup-to-date U-15 data is not yet available to confirm this.  \n4 The numbers given are for those applying in a given academic year. The date of first registration is frequently in a different \nacademic year. Unlike the vast majority of undergraduate students, almost 15% of graduate students do not start in the fall term. \n5948 \n6469 \n7301 7157 \n8076 \n9184 9259 \n10309 9855 \n9298 \n2696 2834 \n3224 3180 3619 3383 3323 3464 3402 3040 \n1888 1945 2202 2226 2509 2393 2342 2558 2538 2063 \n0\n2000\n4000\n6000\n8000\n10000\n12000\nHe\nad\nco\nun\nt \nAcademic Year \nApplications Applicants Admitted Applicants Registered\n15 \n2.2 Domestic Graduate Admissions \nSource: FGSR Statistics \nBetween 2011-2012 and 2014-2015, the number of domestic doctoral applicants fell by more \nthan 30%, the number of Master’s thesis-based applicants was almost stable, and the number \nof Master’s course-based applicants grew by almost 24%. The declines in offers and \nregistrations were in both doctoral and Master’s course-based pools.  \nThe ten-year trend, however, shows an increase of 23% in applications and, concomitantly, a \ndecline from 42% (1397 of 3352) to 39% in our admit rate. A decline in the number of applicants \nadmitted demonstrates greater selectiveness: an important quality indicator. \nIt is noteworthy that yield rates for domestic applicants have always been significantly higher \nthan for international (around 75%, versus under 60%). \n3352 3521 \n3981 \n3732 3723 \n3955 3755 \n4456 4449 4132 \n1833 1903 \n2102 1945 2037 1980 1857 1923 1892 1594 \n1397 1435 1586 1495 1588 1551 1456 1560 1515 \n1165 \n0\n1000\n2000\n3000\n4000\n5000\n6000\nHe\nad\nco\nun\nt \nAcademic Year \nApplications Applicants Admitted Applicants Registered\n16 \n2.3 International Graduate Admissions  \nApplicants on a study permit form an increasingly large part of the total graduate applicant pool.  \nSource: FGSR Statistics \nAs is the case with domestic admissions, the ten-year trend here is remarkable, with \ninternational applicants more than doubling (at their peak) over the last decade. Admission rate \nin 2005-06 was 30% (734 of 2449); in 2014-15 it is down to 25.6%. Again, this is an indication of \nquality. \nThe decline of more than 11% since 2012-2013 is mainly in the doctoral (19%) and Master’s \nthesis-based (10%) pools. The number of offers and registrations has grown for the international \ndoctoral and Master’s course-based pools.

Convocation and Completion \nThis section provides information on graduate students obtaining graduate degrees by \ngraduating cohort. This means looking at the cohort who graduated in a given year. An \nalternative is to take a cohort who started in a particular year, and analyze their various \ncharacteristics over time. The method used here provides a more accurate picture of completion \ntimes, while the other method is to be used for analyzing completion and attrition rates. \n3.1 Number of Graduate Degrees Granted  \nSource: FGSR Statistics \nThis chart does not show the small but increasing number of post-baccalaureate certificates that \nare also awarded: typically, now, two to three dozen per year.  \n325 304 370 352 \n368 373 361 \n416 489 450 \n555 493 512 509 526 545 \n644 626 647 599 \n618 605 651 654 \n770 \n880 936 925 \n987 974 \n0\n200\n400\n600\n800\n1000\n1200\nHe\nad\nco\nun\nt \nAcademic Year \nDoctoral Master's Thesis-Based Master's Course-Based\n20 \n3.2 Average Completion Times by Degree Type \nEfforts have been underway to reduce completion times, particularly for doctoral students. As \nthe chart below shows, however, times to completion have remained relatively stable for the last \ndecade. An investigation of the distribution of completion times, particularly for doctoral \nstudents, may be warranted. This will answer questions such as whether the average \ncompletion times are being skewed by a relatively small number of students taking an inordinate \namount of time to complete their programs. \nSource for this section: FGSR Statistics \nAcademic  \nYear Doctoral M-T M-C \n2005-2006 5.6 2.88 2.58 \n2006-2007 5.45 2.85 2.59 \n2007-2008 5.57 2.96 2.56 \n2008-2009 5.77 2.87 2.58 \n2009-2010 5.83 2.82 2.48 \n2010-2011 5.88 2.85 2.33 \n2011-2012 5.63 2.7 2.32 \n2012-2013 5.63 2.79 2.33 \n2013-2014 5.67 2.78 2.36 \n2014-2015 5.67 2.71 2.27 \nM-T = Master’s Thesis-Based, M-C = Master’s Course-Based \n3.3 Average Completion Times by Citizenship  \nInternational graduate students complete their degrees significantly faster.

The remainder consists of those who have left the University without any \ncredential. \nAttrition rates and attrition times (how long it takes a graduate student to stop having a \nregistration without having obtained a credential) are matters that the University has to \nunderstand and monitor.   \nThe issue is subtle: The attrition rate in 2005-2006 was about 21.5%, while the attrition rate in \n2009-2010 was about 14.7%. This number, however, can rise to as high as 27%, depending on \nhow many of the 2009-2010 students who are still registered eventually convocate with a \ndegree. \nIn the aggregate table that follows, we decline to calculate attrition rates for cohorts that fall \nwithin the average time to completion of a PhD (5.67 years, or 2010-11) – of course, this hides \nthe Master’s rates. The program-specific tables that follow break out this information more fully. \nIt must be emphasized that attrition rates become more speculative as we move toward the \npresent. \nAcademic  \nYear \nApplicants \nRegistered Convocations Still Active Remaining \nAttrition \nRate \n2005-2006 1897 1479 9 409 21.5% \n2006-2007 1951 1552 27 372 19.0% \n2007-2008 2204 1740 52 412 18.7% \n2008-2009 2228 1701 139 388 17.4% \n2009-2010 2516 1840 305 371 14.7% \n2010-2011 2397 1553 529 315 N/A \n2011-2012 2345 1355 698 292 N/A \n2012-2013 2563 1024 1215 324 N/A \n2013-2014 2538 352 1959 227 N/A \n2014-2015 2063 5 2037 21 N/A \n22 \n3.4.1 Doctoral Attrition Rates \nDoctoral attrition, especially if it happens after several years, represents a significant cost to \nboth the student and the University.

Hemani: \nDear Sir/Madam, \nThe Decision to Move C4W from Faculty of Arts \nI am writing with regards to the recent decision to move Center for Writers (C4W) \nfrom the Faculty of Arts at the University of Alberta to Student Services. This decision did \nnot go through ANY level of governance and came as a shock for both the Director of C4W, \nDr. Lucie Moussu and the tutors because none of these stakeholders were consulted in the \nprocess of decision-making.  \nWriting is commonly accepted as a craft but for the students at the University to \ndevelop this skill effectively during their undergraduate and graduate years, it is essential \nthat support for writing is available to students—and for free, to avoid equity issues. It is \neven more important that these services are reflexively administered such that people \ndirecting and offering these services are academics with due experience and a PhD in a \nfield related to improving the writing and communication skills of all students (especially \ninternational students!).  \nThe Centre for Writers and its placement in the Faculty of Arts at the University of \nAlberta has a history. The decision to establish the centre came about as a result of THREE \nyears of extensive research and consultation (details of the 300-page report can found \nhere: http://writing.ualberta.ca/en/Writing%20Task%20Force.aspx), in which the Writing \nTask Force (which included many students and representatives from across campus) \nagreed that the C4W should be housed in an academic Faculty and have an academic \ndirector. This was approved by all levels of governance (Student Union, GFC, TLAT, FAC, \netc.) and every single Faculty on campus. This thinking and philosophy enabled the centre \nto function as an academic body within the university. It currently can conduct research \nand publish on writing issues, attend and present at conferences, and be active in the field. \nThe current director, Dr. Lucie Moussu, for example, is currently the President of the \nCanadian Writing Centres Association, and many tutors at the Centre would be presenting \nor volunteering at the upcoming Congress of Humanities in Calgary.  \nThe present decision to move C4W from Faculty of Arts was done behind doors and \nwith zero consultation with students or faculty members. How is it that a very successful \nwriting center at the University of Alberta, that has been offering free services to support \nstudents and faculty members in higher-order problems in writing (e.g., critical thinking, \nunderstanding of audience), can be moved to “Student Services” without the consultation of \n2 \nits academic supervisor Dr. Lucie Moussu or anyone else in the Faculty of Arts or elsewhere \nat the university?  \nDr. Moussu’s research in the area of writing center work has not only inspired \nstudents from MLCS to research on this subject but also drawn students from Computer \nSciences to adopt qualitative approaches to studying the writing behaviors of students. She \nhas published in international journals, presented at numerous international conferences, \nhelped build a strong professional association, organized writing centre conferences, \nsuccessfully applied for grants for her work (including a recent SSHRC grant), and also \nsupported the work of numerous writing centres across the world. It is important for a \nresearch university like the UoA to acknowledge that just as writing is not only a craft but \nalso a research field evident through the effective “Writing Studies” program, writing \ncenters are part of this academic milieu of critical thinking and reflexive analysis of current \npractices.  \nUnfortunately, as a result of the current decision, Dr. Lucie Moussu will have to \nresign from her position because of her dismissal from the Centre.  In addition to this, the \ntutors were recently contacted by Barbara Heagle who opened her letter with the following \nwords: \n“It has come to my attention that the change in administration for the C4W, which \nhas just been announced, may have led to some misunderstanding about the status \nof the C4W and its tutors. I want to dispel any rumors or misinformation, and make \nthe situation as clear as possible.” \n     The tone and language of this email is disrespectful to the current director who is \nsubtly being accused of spreading “rumors and misinformation.”  As a graduate student at \nthe University, I find it shameful that the official communication generated by the Faculty \nof Arts dishonors the academic staff in this way!!  \nI, as an international student and tutor at the Center for Writers for three years, \nhave found not only a sense of community at this center but also an openness to embrace \nstudents from diverse cultures and backgrounds as creating a true sense of egalitarianism, \nequity, support, and mutual respect that I have not adequately witnessed at any other \nplaces on campus, especially not the Student Services.  The Centre for Writers is \nincreasingly diverse in its employment of student tutors. The tutors at the Centre for \nWriters are both domestic and international and come from great diversity of ethnic and \ndisciplinary backgrounds---an element that is not very evident in institutions run by \nStudent Services.   \nFor me, the Centre for Writers has not only been a source of student employment \nbut its people and resources are a continuous inspiration to think and improve my writing.  \nI believe that by removing this free service from the Faculty of Arts would do a great \ndisservice to the faculty and students, and lower the standards of student writing in \ncourses and publications, placing a greater burden on the professors to guide their \nstudents to cultivate good writing habits.  \n3 \nThe common belief is that writing centres are remedial places where only struggling \nstudents will go. Research shows that this is absolutely not the case—excellent students \nknow that good writing takes time to learn, that a second pair of eyes is crucial to their \nprogress, and that the discussions that take place in writing centres are critical to their \nunderstanding and learning of academic writing in their disciplines. The philosophy upon \nwhich this center has been thriving is rooted in a body of thinking about the purpose of \nCentre for Writers in the wider academia and Canadian and American Writing Associations.  \nResearch shows that “fixing” students papers will not teach them how to become good \ncommunicators and successful professionals. This institution is not a clinic where students \nget their writing “fixed” but a place of careful reflection and questioning that has \nconnections with thinking in other disciplines of arts.  \nEven though, the Faculty of Arts is undergoing a very difficult moment in its history, \nremoving the support for writing from the faculty will undermine the very goals of the \nfaculty to promote excellence in research and teaching.  The recent announcement by Dean \nDavid Turpin mentioned and I quote:  \n“I am pleased to report that the government is providing stable funding to Alberta’s \n26 post-secondary institutions as promised in Bill 3. We will receive a two percent \nincrease to the base operating grant. Tuition remains frozen, but we will receive \nbackfill funding to cover the loss in tuition revenue equivalent to the annual CPI \nincrease. The government has also extended much-needed funding to the end of July \n2017 to support student mental health initiatives.” \nConsidering this positive increase, a case needs to be made to maintain this center \nfor writers within the Faculty of Arts that was once established through three years of \nextensive research by a university-wide committee, at the request of the Student Union, \nand has been serving students from Arts, Humanities, Sciences and every other faculty and \ndepartment across campus.  \nIn order to maintain excellence in the writing and communication skills produced \nfrom this university, I, as a Graduate Representative at the General Faculties of Council, \nwould like to petition against the recent decision that was taken mysteriously (without the \nconsultation of any stakeholders) to move the Centre for Writers out of Arts and remove \nDr. Lucie Moussu from its directorship, and call for bringing this issue for discussion at the \nnext FAC
