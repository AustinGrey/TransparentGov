Discussion: Mr Mardhani-Bayne reported that the proposal contains final performance indicators to be used towards For the Public Good. Members discussed the final performance measures of For the Public Good, and made several observations surrounding how publication citations could be measured, the difficulty in creating performance measures which apply to all Faculties and areas, and that there are many examples of community engagement which could be included within the measures. The Chair thanked the presenters for their report.",

I would \nappreciate the General Faculties Council’s help in both sharing and implementing our plan. To this \nend, I have highlighted current initiatives and provided updates within the context of For the Public \nGood. I have also identified a few of my own key talking points for the coming months throughout \nthe report.   \nWe will continue to develop and add to the For the Public Good website as the primary online \nplatform for communicating about the plan. The site will provide updates about the specific \nobjectives, initiatives, and strategic planning processes being undertaken across the university and \nwithin faculties and units. As we finalize the metrics and measures of our success, the site will also \nhouse reports on our progress. \nGENERAL FACULTIES  COUNCIL \nFor the Meeting of January 30, 2017\nItem No. 3\nhttps://www.ualberta.ca/strategic-plan\n2 \nOFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT  \n2-24 South Academic Building (SAB)  |  Edmonton, Alberta, Canada T6G 2G7  |  president.ualberta.ca \nIndigenous Canada \nThis January, the Faculty of Native Studies opened a new online course called NS 201 --- \n‘‘Indigenous Canada.’’ NS 201 is designed for students who are not Native Studies majors. The \ncourse surveys historical and contemporary relationships between Indigenous peoples and \nnewcomers, and aims to expand Canadians’ understandings of these relations. While NS 201 is \ncurrently offered for credit, it will eventually be offered as a MOOC (Massive Open Online Course). \nAccessible public education initiatives, like NS 201, are one of the ways in which we are responding \nto the Truth and Reconciliation Commission’s Calls to Action. \nKEY TALKING POINT:  \nThrough initiatives like the new online course, Indigenous Canada, the \nUniversity of Alberta encourages students, faculty, staff, and the \nbroader community to become active participants in reconciliation.   \nNational Recruitment Strategy \nRegistrar Lisa Collins has taken the lead on Objective 1: developing and implementing a national \nrecruitment strategy.  \nAn important part of the objective is ensuring that we have effective, coordinated infrastructure to \nsupport student admissions. This fall, the Registrar’s Office implemented a new admission process \ncalled Automatic Evaluation. The automated admissions system has significantly decreased \nprocessing times for high school students applying for the 2017-18 academic year. Application \nefficiency will underpin our future efforts as we strive to build a diverse and exceptional community \nof undergraduate and graduate students.  \nhttps://www.ualberta.ca/courses/indigenous-canada\nhttps://www.ualberta.ca/courses/indigenous-canada\n3 \nOFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT  \n2-24 South Academic Building (SAB)  |  Edmonton, Alberta, Canada T6G 2G7  |  president.ualberta.ca \nInternational Week 2017 \nInternational Week, which runs from January 30 through February 5 this year, is the largest annual \nextracurricular educational event on campus. I-Week brings global conversations to the University \nof Alberta, and engages our whole community in the discussion. The numerous speakers and \nworkshops create spaces where we can hear each other, see from new perspectives, and work \ntowards solutions together. \nIn For the Public Good, our community signaled the importance of experiential learning \nopportunities for our graduate and undergraduate students. We also identified the goal of inspiring \nengaged citizens who can think globally when tackling local problems. Events like International \nWeek expose U of A students to global challenges and viewpoints, and help to nourish and \nencourage those next-generation leaders. \nKEY TALKING POINT:  \nBuilding global citizenship is an important part of a university \neducation. That means giving U of A students from Alberta and Canada \nan opportunity to learn about other cultures and develop a worldview \nthat’s enriched by students from other countries.   \nRehabilitation Medicine Satellite Programs \nI recently visited the Faculty of Rehabilitation Medicine’s satellite program in Calgary. Through \nsynchronized distance learning and double robotics, professors are broadcasting interactive \nlectures and seminars between Edmonton, Calgary, and Camrose. The system allows us to offer U \nof A’s MSc Occupational Therapy and Physical Therapy programs in Calgary, and our MSc Physical \nTherapy program in Camrose. It is one of the ways that we have deepened inter-campus \nconnections, communications, and collaborations, and provided high-quality learning experiences \nfor students throughout the province.   \nhttp://www.globaled.ualberta.ca/internationalweek.aspx\nhttps://www.ualberta.ca/rehabilitation/news/2016/november/robots-help-ualberta-double-up-on-rehab-training-in-calgary\n4 \nOFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT  \n2-24 South Academic Building (SAB)  |  Edmonton, Alberta, Canada T6G 2G7  |  president.ualberta.ca \nSignature Areas \nProvost Steven Dew, Vice-president (Research) Lorne Babiuk and I launched the Signature Areas \ninitiative at a campus forum on November 17, 2016. Following the forum, we opened a formal \nproposal process to engage the whole university community in this important conversation.  \nThe proposal process closes on January 28. A development panel will review these proposals \nagainst the criteria we laid out in For the Public Good, and develop a long list of signature areas for \nfinal consideration. Please watch for a call for community consultations on the long list in March.  \nYou can learn more about the signature area development process on the For the Public Good \nwebsite.  \nKEY TALKING POINT:  \nFrom our broad strength as a research-intensive university, we are \nhighlighting areas of global distinction by building a portfolio of \nsignature areas. \nAcademic Excellence \nAt the end of October, 20 graduate students, post-doctoral fellows, and professors were recognized \nat the annual Killam celebration for their outstanding academic achievement, leadership, and \nmentorship. The Killam awards tradition stretches back nearly half a century at the U of A. \nColleen Murphy recently received the Governor General’s Literary Award for Drama for her play, \nPig Girl. Murphy is the U of A’s Lee Playwright in Residence, and this honour marks the second \nGovernor General’s Literary Award of her career.  \nThis December, 13 U of A faculty members were named Canada Research Chairs. The University of \nAlberta is now home to 51 tier one chairs and 33 tier two chairs. \nhttps://www.ualberta.ca/strategic-plan/institutional-priorities/signature-areas-development\nhttps://www.ualberta.ca/strategic-plan\nhttps://www.ualberta.ca/strategic-plan/institutional-priorities/signature-areas-development\nhttps://www.ualberta.ca/strategic-plan/institutional-priorities/signature-areas-development\nhttp://blog.ualberta.ca/2016/10/2016-killam-laureates-honoured.html\nhttps://www.ualberta.ca/news-and-events/newsarticles/2016/november/celebrated-u-of-a-playwright-plumbs-dark-side-of-human-nature\nhttps://www.ualberta.ca/news-and-events/newsarticles/2016/december/research-offers-cautious-hope-to-spinal-cord-injury-sufferers\n5 \nOFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT  \n2-24 South Academic Building (SAB)  |  Edmonton, Alberta, Canada T6G 2G7  |  president.ualberta.ca \nInternational Travel \nNear the end of the fall term, I travelled to India to cultivate our many relationships and \npartnerships in the country. U of A is responsible for more than 10 per cent of all academic \nagreements signed between Canadian and Indian institutions.  \nOur current focus is on facilitating student and faculty mobility. To that end, we signed several \nagreements of note. We are the first international university to sign with the Indian Science and \nEngineering Research Board, a major research organization in India. Through the agreement, we \nwill bring graduate students to the U of A using a similar approach to China Scholarship Council. \nWe also signed an MOU with Infosys, India’s leading global IT company. This MOU opens the door \nto joint research projects in energy, machine learning, and climate change, and provides a new \navenue to high-quality international internships for U of A undergraduate and graduate students.  \nNear the end of the tour, I spoke about U of A’s leadership in future energy systems research at the \n2016 Petrotech Conference, and addressed a group of more than 100 students interested in \npursuing studies in the area.  \nI have provided a reflection about the tour on The Quad. \nUniversities Canada Professional Program for Presidents \nIn early January, I co-led a development session with Mike Mahon, president of the University of \nLethbridge, at Universities Canada’s Professional Program for Presidents. Mike and I led a \ndiscussion with post-secondary presidents from around the country on the role of presidents in \nIndigenous reconciliation efforts within the academy. The session offered a chance to highlight the \nUniversity of Alberta’s initiatives, learn from leaders at other universities and colleges, engage with \nthe national post-secondary community to address some shared challenges, and continue the \nimportant conversation on reconciliation in our institutions.   \nhttp://blog.ualberta.ca/2016/12/from-presidents-desk-dec-19-2016.html\n6 \nOFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT  \n2-24 South Academic Building (SAB)  |  Edmonton, Alberta, Canada T6G 2G7  |  president.ualberta.ca \nTuition and Funding Reviews \nThe provincial government reviews on tuition and the post-secondary funding model will be \npriorities for us this winter. Along with members of the senior leadership team, and colleagues \nthroughout the sector, Provost Steven Dew and I are focused on leading and shaping these \ndiscussions to ensure sustained support for the University of Alberta. \nWe are also working with our post-secondary partners to articulate the importance of funding \nuniversities in the immediate lead-up to the provincial government’s 2017-18 budget. We are aware \nof the financial constraints under which the province is operating, and are advocating for increased \nsupport as has been the case in the past two years. \nOn the federal side, I am working with colleagues at Universities Canada and the U15 to take full \nadvantage of the opportunities that continue to develop due to the government’s pro-innovation and \nresearch agenda. Our priorities include increased funding to the granting councils and investment \nto cover the full costs of research. \nVP Searches \nWe have now launched searches for two new vice-presidents: research and university relations. \nThe search committees for each portfolio have met and commenced their work. At this time, I \nwould like to invite all members of the U of A community to share your views on the priorities of the \nvice-president (research) and vice-president (university relations), including current issues, \nleadership, and the future direction of each office. \nI would also like to congratulate Jonathan Schaeffer on his recent reappointment as dean of \nscience. I look forward to working with Jonathan in the coming five years. \nThank you for your continued dedication to the University of Alberta. \nYours sincerely, \nDavid H.

FPG Performance Indicators Advisory Group – membership (1 page) \nPrepared by: Logan Mardhani-Bayne, Initiatives Manager (Audit and Analysis), lmardhan@ualberta.ca \nAs approved by President’s Executive Committee – Strategic (05 Jan. 2017)    \nFor the Public Good (FPG): \nApproved Performance Indicators \nIntroduction \nIn July 2016, the university established an advisory group to recommend a framework for reporting on \nperformance against For the Public Good (FPG). Following an extended consultation process with the university \ncommunity, these performance indicators were approved in January 2017. \nPrinciples for performance indicators: \nIn June 2016, the President’s Executive Committee – Strategic (PEC-S) endorsed the following principles: \n• a focused, manageable framework that blends quantitative and qualitative indicators \n• indicators reflecting outcomes rather than simply activities, where possible \n• integrity and efficiency of data collection \n• relevance of indicators to FPG objectives \n• selection of relevant comparators \n• timely modification of indicators to reflect institutional evolution (NOTE: indicators will be adjusted to \nreflect priorities identified through implementation already underway, e.g. defining  signature areas)  \nReporting contexts: \nThe U of A has two primary reporting contexts, each of which warrants distinct indicators: \n• Government (public) reporting: Comprehensive Institutional Plan (CIP), Annual Report (AR).  \no The CIP and Annual Report are based on provincial guidelines, which recommend that \ninstitutions develop approximately 15 performance measures. These tend to be outcome-\nbased, and should present a comprehensive view of the institution’s core functions.  \n• Internal indicators: administrative and other Board of Governors reports.  \no These tend to be activity-based indicators, indicators for trend identification, and/or faculty-\nlevel information not suitable for overall institutional reporting. \nThe table on page two provides an overview of indicators for each FPG Goal. Indicators may be relevant to \nmultiple FPG Goals, but each is listed only under the area of most direct relevance. The indicators presented \nare intended to form the basis of key public and internal reporting; it is not intended that every indicator will \nbe included in every reporting period. Faculty-level breakdowns can be made available for use by individual \nunits where sufficient data exists.  \nThe remainder of this document presents detailed descriptions of these indicators and existing targets. The \nexamples provided are drawn from existing reports and may not reflect the full scope of each indicator. \nAcronyms: \nNSSE National Survey on Student Engagement - standardized survey administered by over 500 institutions in \nCanada and the U.S. \nGOS Graduate Outcomes Survey – biennial survey of Alberta post-secondary graduates, conducted two years \npost-graduation (includes undergraduate and graduate levels) \nCGPSS Canadian Graduate and Professional Student Survey – national survey of student satisfaction \nCAST Contract Academic Staff – Teaching \nTRC Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada \nSTARS Sustainability Tracking, Assessment and Rating System  \n2 \nOverview of Performance Indicators \nFPG Alignment Government (public) reporting Internal indicators \nBUILD \n1.

Citation impact is an important indicator \nof research impact, but no existing citation indicator is comprehensive or equally relevant across \ndisciplines. Reporting will combine data from multiple sources (as an illustrative example only, the \ntable below presents Leiden rankings on number and proportion of publications among the 10% most \ncited in field). \nSample (Leiden Rankings) \nCitation impact rankings  \nNumber of publications in top \n10% most cited in field \nProportion of publications in \ntop 10% most cited in field  \nCan. rank World rank Can. rank World rank \n 4 48 14 330 \nSource: CWTS Leiden Rankings \nNotes: The “proportion” ranking reflects the proportion of all publications attributable to U of A authors that rank among the \nmost cited in their respective fields. The “number” ranking reflects the absolute number of publications attributable to U of A \nauthors that rank among the most cited in their respective fields (this ranking tends to favour larger institutions).  \n• Student-reported experience with faculty (seniors) \nObjective 14: Support excellence in teaching and learning \n8 \nNSSE surveys students on two Experiences with Faculty indicators. Mean scores reflect the frequency \nwith which students reported positive items in each indicator category. If this indicator is retained, an \nappropriate visualization will be developed. \nSample (2014 NSSE) \nStudent-faculty \ninteraction \n Mean score \nU of A 17.7 \nU15 17.2 \nEffective teaching \npractices \nU of A 36.6 \nU15 34.8 \nSource: NSSE 2014 \nNote: Each indicator is scored on a 60-point scale. To produce an indicator score, the response set for each item is \nconverted to a 60-point scale (e.g., Never = 0; Sometimes = 20; Often = 40; Very often = 60), and the rescaled items \nare averaged. Thus a score of zero means a student responded at the bottom of the scale for every item, while a \nscore of 60 indicates responses at the top of the scale on every item. \nStudent-faculty interaction includes: discussing career plans; working with faculty on activities other than \ncoursework; discussing course concepts outside of class; discussing academic performance.  \nEffective teaching practices includes: clear course goals and requirements; organized course sessions; use of \nexamples/illustrations; providing feedback on work in progress; providing feedback on completed work. \nInternal indicators: \n• Rankings (THE and QS – overall and subject-\narea) \n• Research and teaching awards (major \nhighlights only) \n• Faculty and staff training opportunities (Gold \nCollege, Chairs’ school  and other programs as \ndeveloped) \n•  \n• Funding profile of post-doctoral fellows (under \ndevelopment \n• Tri-Council grants (number received per faculty \nand success rate compared to competition \naverage), by agency) \nENGAGE \nPrimary indicators attempt to capture the impact of engagement on student development, communities and \ninstitutional reputation. Qualitative reports in this area are critical and need to be developed. \nNOTE: Media impact metrics developed under Build are relevant to Engage Objective 16: Community \nengagement and engaged research \n• Student-reported citizenship development (seniors) \nObjective 16: Community engagement and engaged research \n9 \nSample (NSSE 2014) \nHow much has your experience at this institution contributed to your knowledge, skills, and personal \ndevelopment in being an informed and active citizen?

A positive ratio indicates positive cash flow from \noperating activities, while a negative ratio indicates negative cash flow from operating activities (and \nmay imply that the institution is not living within available resources).  \nInternal indicators: \n• Endowment  and donations received \n• Voluntary turnover of staff/faculty  \n• Deferred maintenance liability (total and \nexpenditure as percentage of capital plan) \n• Financial indicators: net income/loss ratio , \nprimary reserve ratio, net operating revenues \nratio, interest burden ratio, viability ratio \n• Greenhouse gas emissions  \n• Health and Safety Indicator report (existing) \nFor the Public Good (FPG): Performance Indicators Advisory Group \nMembership List \nName Title/Office \nMary Persson (Chair) AVP, Audit and Analysis  \nAmy Dambrowitz Strategic Development Manager, Office of the \nProvost \nAnita Molzahn Dean, Faculty of Nursing \nDavid Evans Vice-Dean – Research, Faculty of Medicine and \nDentistry \nHarvey Krahn Professor, Sociology  \nLeah Vanderjagt Digital Repository Services Librarian, Libraries \nSusan Hamilton AVP, Research \nLlars Hallstrom Professor and Director, Alberta Centre for \nSustainable Rural Communities \nColin More Doctoral Candidate, Physics \nDeborah Williams (Resource) Director, Strategic Analysis and Data Warehousing \nLogan Mardhani-Bayne (Resource) Initiatives Manager, Audit and Analysis \nItem No. 7 \nGENERAL FACULTIES COUNCIL \nFor the Meeting of January 30, 2017 \nOUTLINE OF ISSUE \nAdvice, Discussion, Information Item  \nAgenda Title: Bachelor of Arts Curriculum Renewal, Faculty of Arts  \nItem   \nProposed by Lesley Cormack, Dean, Faculty of Arts \nPresenters Allen Ball and Rebecca Nagel, Associate Deans, Student Programs \nDetails \nResponsibility Provost and Vice-President (Academic) \nThe Purpose of the item is \n(please be specific) \nTo provide an overview of and answer questions about the BA \nCurriculum Renewal from the Faculty of Arts. \nTimeline/Implementation Date September 1, 2018 \nSupplementary Notes and \ncontext \nThe current structure of the Faculty of Arts Bachelor of Arts (BA) Basic \nRequirements has been in place since the 2006 – 2007 academic year. \nIn November 2011, Arts Faculty Council approved a five year Academic \nPlan that included a systematic review of the BA general requirements.  \nThe ensuing consultation process has led to this final version of the BA \nRenewal Proposal. \nThe goal of the BA Curriculum Renewal is to develop a sustainable BA \nprogram that provides Arts students with an exemplary undergraduate \ndegree.  \nA renewed BA in the Faculty of Arts must be flexible enough to \naccommodate the exceptional breadth and depth in programming offered \nin our Faculty. This renewed BA must also continue to enable a broad \nrange of pedagogical methods, from traditional instructional strategies to \ncommunity-engaged experiential learning, while retaining our rigorous \nacademic standards. \nThe Faculty of Arts has provided a web link on our homepage to the \nentire history of the BA Renewal process, proposal and appendices. \nEngagement and Routing (Include meeting dates) \nParticipation: \n(parties who have seen the \nproposal and in what capacity) \n<For further information see \nthe link posted on the \nGovernance Toolkit section \nStudent Participation Protocol> \nThose who have been informed: \n• All Arts faculty and staff \n• All Arts undergraduate students \n• Faculty of Arts undergraduate students’ association (OASIS) \n• University of Alberta Students’ Union \n• Associates Deans (Undergraduate) across the University \n• Office of the Provost \n• Faculty of Arts Alumni \nThose who have been consulted: \nAssociate Dean Ball has: \n• During the 2015-2016 academic year, Associate Dean Ball held \nindividual meetings with all 15 Faculty of Arts Department Chairs, \nas well as the Executive Director of Community Service-Learning \nhttps://www.ualberta.ca/arts/about/ba-renewal\nhttp://www.governance.ualberta.ca/GovernanceToolkit/Toolkit.aspx\nhttp://www.governance.ualberta.ca/GovernanceToolkit/Toolkit.aspx\nItem No. 7 \nGENERAL FACULTIES COUNCIL \nFor the Meeting of January 30, 2017 \nand the Director of the Office of Interdisciplinary Studies  \n• Ongoing updates on the BA Curriculum Renewal process have \nbeen provided by Associate Dean Ball to members of the central \nadministration, including:  \no Meg Brolley, General Faculty Council Secretary \no Dr. Sarah Forgie, Vice Provost (Learning Initiatives) \no Dr. Nat Kav, Vice Provost (Academic Programs and \nInstruction) \no Kate Peters, Portfolio Initiatives Manager, Office of the \nProvost and Vice-President (Academic) \no Dr. Christine Brown, Head Librarian \nThe potential changes to our BA have also been discussed with \nFaculties across campus.  \n• Dr. Jason Carey, Associate Dean (Programs & Planning), \nFaculty of Engineering \n• Dr. Janice Causgrove Dunn, Associate Dean (Undergraduate \nPrograms), Faculty of Physical Education and Recreation \n• Dr. Robin Everall, Interim Vice-Provost and Dean of Students \n• Dr. Elaine Geddes, Associate Dean (Undergraduate), Alberta \nSchool of Business \n• Dr. Clive Hickson, Associate Dean (Undergraduate Programs \nand Services), Faculty of Education \n• Dr. Tim Joseph, Associate Dean (Student & Co-op Services), \nFaculty of Engineering \n• Dr. Brenda Leskiw, Senior Associate Dean (Undergraduate), \nFaculty of Science \n• Dr. Karsten Mundel, Director & Associate Dean (Academic), \nAugustana Campus \n• Dr. Frank Tough, Associate Dean (Academic), Faculty of \nNative Studies  \n• An update on the BA Curriculum Renewal consultation process \nwas presented by Associate Dean Ball at Arts Faculty Council on \nOctober 5, 2015.  \n• The process has also been discussed extensively in each 2015-\n2016 Arts Teaching and Learning Enhancement Committee and \nat the Associate Chairs (Undergraduate) 2015-2016 meetings.  \n• Roundtable sessions have taken place with the Undergraduate \nStudent Services staff to address the possible administrative \nimpacts of different changes to the BA common requirements. \no In addition, the Recruitment and Engagement team have \narticulated the needs and interests of prospective \nstudents. \n• The Faculty of Arts: BA Curriculum Renewal Discussion Paper \nwas distributed across the Faculty on January 8, 2016. The \nproposal was initially discussed at Faculty of Arts Chairs Council \non January 20, 2016, and again at Faculty of Arts Chairs Council \non February 3, 2016. Associate Dean Ball also presented and \ndiscussed the proposal at Arts Executive Council on February 25, \n2016.  \n• A town hall meeting was held on February 5, 2016.  \no More than 100 students, staff, and faculty attended this \nItem No. 7 \nGENERAL FACULTIES COUNCIL \nFor the Meeting of January 30, 2017 \nopen forum.  \n• An online form was also circulated prior to the event, inviting \nfeedback about the BA Curriculum Renewal Discussion Paper \nfrom those who would not be able to attend the town hall.  \n• During Winter 2016, Associate Dean Ball presented the BA \nCurriculum Renewal Discussion Paper at the following \nDepartmental Councils: Anthropology; Art and Design; English \nand Film Studies; History and Classics; Linguistics; Modern \nLanguages and Cultural Studies; and Philosophy.  \n• We have developed an open and robust dialogue with Arts \nstudents about the renewal process through numerous \ndiscussions with our Faculty of Arts Students’ Association, \nOASIS (Organization for Arts Students and Interdisciplinary \nStudies).  \n• Associate Dean Ball was invited to participate in a student town \nhall organized by OASIS on March 8, 2016. All BA students were \ninvited to attend to ask questions and give feedback.  \no The event was well attended and the students’ thoughtful \nobservations, along with the complete record of students’ \ncontributions, were added to the Faculty’s consideration \nof the BA Curriculum Renewal.  \n• A survey was distributed on March 10, 2016 (closing March 20, \n2016), to gauge students’ and faculty members’ initial response \nto the BA Renewal Discussion Paper.  \no The survey garnered nearly 1000 responses, with 831 \nstudents and 167 faculty members submitting their \nopinions. The aggregated results were made available on \nApril 7, 2016. 3  \n• On April 27, 2016 Associate Dean Ball met with the executive \nmembers of OASIS to discuss the results of the surveys. \n• Associate Dean Ball met with representatives from the Graduate \nStudent Association (GSA) on May 19, 2016 to explore the \nimpacts the proposed changes to the BA may have on graduate \nstudent recruitment and retention.  \n• A meeting to discuss the BA Renewal Proposal with OASIS was \nheld on September 22, 2016.  \n• Dean Lesley Cormack moderated a second town hall meeting on \nSeptember 30, 2016.  \no Once again, more than 100 students, staff, and faculty \nattended this open forum.  \no A video recording of the town hall can be viewed online.  \no An online form was circulated prior to the event, inviting \nfeedback about the BA Curriculum Renewal Discussion \nPaper from those who would not be able to attend the \ntown hall.  \no An update on the BA Renewal Proposal process was \npresented by Associate Dean Ball at Arts Faculty Council \non October 3, 2016. \nThose who are actively participating: \n• Dean Lesley Cormack (History and Classics) \n• Acting Dean/Vice-Dean Lise Gotell (Women’s and Gender \nStudies) \nItem No. 7 \nGENERAL FACULTIES COUNCIL \nFor the Meeting of January 30, 2017 \n• Acting Vice-Dean Stuart Landon (Economics) \n• Associate Dean (Graduate) Tom Spalding (Psychology)  \n• Associate Dean (Research) Michael O’Driscoll (English and Film \nStudies) \n• Associate Dean (Research) Steve Patten (Political Science) \n• Associate Dean (Student Programs) Rebecca Nagel (History and \nClassics)  \n• Associate Dean (Student Programs: Teaching & Learning) Allen \nBall (Art and Design) \n• Senior Officer (Student Programs & Services) Robin A Cowan \nFormal Governance Path: \nThe proposed changes to the BA Basic Requirements follow the \nstandard governance pathway.  \n• Within the Faculty of Arts, changes were reviewed and \nunanimously approved by  \no Academic Affairs Committee (AAC) on October 26, 2016,  \nand  \no Arts Executive Committee (AEC) on November 3, 2016.  \n• And passed by Arts Faculty Council (AFC) on November 24, \n2016.  \nThese changes will affect calendar section entries for the Bachelor of \nArts (BA), BA Honors Program Requirements, and the After Degree \nPrograms  \nAlignment/Compliance \nAlignment with Guiding \nDocuments \nBUILD \n• This BA renewal proposal forms a critical part of a broader effort \nby the Faculty of Arts to offer a truly outstanding BA program that \nwill attract and retain the very best and brightest students from \nAlberta, Canada, and the world. \nEXPERIENCE \n• The revised BA will provide space for students to engage in one \nor more of the variety of exceptional experiential learning \nopportunities, whether it be research, study abroad, community-\nservice learning, or work experience. \nEXCEL \n• We believe that the proposed BA redesign will make the Faculty \nof Arts attractive to students across Canada, creating room for \ndistinction and distinctiveness in teaching, learning, research, \nand service, since the redesign allows departments to refocus \ncourse offerings in areas of excellence and interest to students. \nENGAGE \n• Faculty emphasis is on community engagement.  The revised BA \nallows us to expand opportunities for students within their degree \nprograms to reach broader and more diverse community partners \nwhile deepening ties to current partners.  (for example, allowing \nmore room for students to engage in work experience, \nItem No. 7 \nGENERAL FACULTIES COUNCIL \nFor the Meeting of January 30, 2017 \ncommunity service-learning, international learning experiences, \nand research with their instructors in the community). \nSUSTAIN \n• The revised BA maintains breadth and depth in study, while \nallowing Departments the opportunity redirect teaching resources \nto areas of excellence. \n• The proposed requirements facilitate more straightforward \ntransition for students transferring to Arts from other programs at \nthe University of Alberta and other post-secondary institutions \nthan is currently possible. \n• A flexible Arts degree means that our students will easily be able \nto accommodate any mandated Faculty or University-wide \nIndigenous studies requirement in their degrees, should this \nrequirement be embraced institutionally.  \nCompliance with Legislation, \nPolicy and/or Procedure \nRelevant to the Proposal \n(please quote legislation and \ninclude identifying section \nnumbers) \n1.

Students in the BA degree should \nseek advice and program approval from the \nAdvisor in the Department of their major \nconcentration or, if appropriate, the \nInterdisciplinary Program advisor. \n2. Common Requirements: (See Arts Chart \n1.) \nThe Common Requirements (★15) are \ndesigned to give the foundation for a \nBachelor of Arts. It is strongly advised that \nstudents complete the Common \nRequirements in the first two years of their \nprograms. \nNote:  Senior-level courses in the area \nof any major or any minor which meet \na Common Requirement must also be \ncounted toward the major or minor \nrequirements. \n3. Major: Students must declare one major, \nand students may declare a second major \nand/or one or more minors. See Programs \nand Certificates for a list of subjects which \nmay be declared as majors in the BA. \nAny major must include a minimum of ★30 to a \nmaximum of ★48 at the senior level (i.e., additional \ncourses in the major may not be taken as options). \nAt least ★6 must be at the 400-level; some \ndepartments may require specific courses and/or \nmore than the specified Faculty minimums. \nWhere two majors are declared, the same Faculty \nminimums and maximums apply in both majors. \nSee below for specific requirements by subject. A \nminimum of ★15 at the senior level toward the \nmajor must be completed with coursework offered \nby the Faculty of Arts at the University of Alberta. \nSenior-level courses in the major subject(s) taken as \npart of the Common Requirements must also count \nhttp://calendar.ualberta.ca/preview_program.php?catoid=6&poid=2526#ArtsChart1BasicRequirements\nhttp://calendar.ualberta.ca/content.php?catoid=6&navoid=834#programs-and-certificates\nhttp://calendar.ualberta.ca/content.php?catoid=6&navoid=834#programs-and-certificates\nhttp://calendar.ualberta.ca/preview_program.php?catoid=6&poid=2526#BAHonorsAndBAMajorMinorRequirements\nhttp://calendar.ualberta.ca/preview_program.php?catoid=6&poid=2526#ArtsChart1BasicRequirements\nhttp://calendar.ualberta.ca/preview_program.php?catoid=6&poid=2526#ArtsChart1BasicRequirements\nhttp://calendar.ualberta.ca/content.php?catoid=6&navoid=834#programs-and-certificates\nhttp://calendar.ualberta.ca/content.php?catoid=6&navoid=834#programs-and-certificates\nhttp://calendar.ualberta.ca/preview_program.php?catoid=6&poid=2526#BAHonorsAndBAMajorMinorRequirements\ncount toward the major(s). \nStudents must declare their major(s) to the \nUndergraduate Student Services Office \nfollowing the accumulation of the 60th unit of \ncourse weight of their BA program, though it is \nto a student's advantage to declare the \nmajor(s) as soon as possible. \n4. Minor: Students who have declared a single \nmajor must also declare a minor. \nSee Programs and Certificates for a list of \nsubjects which may be declared as minors in \nthe BA. \nA minor must include a minimum of ★12 to a \nmaximum of ★42 at the senior level in an \napproved subject outside the single major. At \nleast ★6 must be at the 300- or 400-level as \nspecified by the department; some \ndepartments require specific courses and/or \nmore than the specified Faculty minimums. \nSee below for specific requirements by \nsubject. The maximum units of course weight \nmay not be exceeded (i.e., additional courses \nin the minor may not be taken as options). For \nArts minors, a minimum of ★6 at the senior \nlevel must be satisfied with coursework offered \nby the Faculty of Arts at the University of \nAlberta and for Science minors, a minimum of \n★9 at the senior level must be satisfied with \ncourse work offered by the Faculty of Science \nat the University of Alberta. Senior-level \ncourses in the minor, taken as part of the basic \nprogram requirements must also be counted \ntoward the minor. \nStudents who declare a double major are not \npermitted to also declare a minor. \nIn addition to the Arts and Science disciplines \nnoted in Programs and Certificates (including \nMATH, PSYCO and STAT), students may also \nselect a minor from the Faculty of Science from \nthe list below. Students must meet the minor \nrequirements of the Faculty of Arts as well as \nthose of the Faculty of Science, which include \nrequirements for specific courses \n[see Minors] therefore, the requirements are a \nminimum of ★24 to a maximum of ★36 in the \nminor subject(s), including no more than ★12 \nat the junior level and at least ★6 at the 300-\nlevel or higher. A Science minor consists of \nScience courses taken from one of the \nfollowing areas: \na. Biological Sciences (see Minors for \nspecific requirements) \nb. Chemistry (see Minors for specific \nrequirements) \nc. Computing Science (see Minors for \nspecific requirements) \nd. Earth and Atmospheric Sciences \n(see Minors for specific requirements \ne. Mathematics (see Minors for specific \nrequirements) \ntoward the major(s). \n Students must declare their major(s) to the \nUndergraduate Student Services Office following the \naccumulation of the 60th unit of course weight of \ntheir BA program, though it is to a student's \nadvantage to declare the major(s) as soon as \npossible. See Declaration or Change of Major/Minor \nin the Forms for Students cabinet. \n 4. Minor: Students may declare one or more \nminors. See Programs and Certificates for a list of \nsubjects which may be declared as minors in the \nBA. A minor must include a minimum of ★12 to a \nmaximum of ★42 at the senior level in an approved \nsubject outside any major. Additional courses in a \nminor may not be taken as options. At least ★6 \nmust be at the 300- or 400-level as specified by the \ndepartment; some disciplines require specific \ncourses and/or more than the specified Faculty \nminimums. See below for specific requirements by \nsubject. For Arts minors, a minimum of ★6 at the \nsenior level must be satisfied with coursework \noffered by the Faculty of Arts at the University of \nAlberta.  For Science minors, a minimum of ★9 at \nthe senior level must be satisfied with course work \noffered by the Faculty of Science at the University of \nAlberta. Senior-level courses in the minor taken as \npart of the Common Requirements must also be \ncounted toward the minor. \n In addition to the Arts and Science disciplines noted \nin Programs and Certificates (including MATH, \nPSYCO and STAT), students may also select a \nminor from the Faculty of Science from the list \nbelow. Students must meet the minor requirements \nof the Faculty of Arts as well as those of the Faculty \nof Science, which include requirements for specific \ncourses [see Minors]. The requirements are a \nminimum of ★24 to a maximum of ★36 in the minor \nsubject(s), including no more than ★12 at the junior \nlevel and at least ★6 at the 300-level or higher. A \nScience minor consists of Science courses taken \nfrom one of the following areas: \na. Biological Sciences (see Minors for \nspecific requirements) \nb.

Statistics \nStudents taking a Science minor are not permitted to \ncomplete a minor in the same department as their \nmajor. \n5. Cross-Listed Courses: Courses listed in more \nthan one major/minor are known as cross-\nlisted courses. \nThe use of cross-listed courses is especially \ncommon in interdisciplinary programs (East \nAsian Studies; Film Studies; International \nStudies; Native Studies; Science Technology \nand Society; Women's and Gender Studies), \nbut is becoming increasingly common in other \nareas also (e.g. Religious Studies). Unless \notherwise notified by the student, the \nUndergraduate Student Services Office will \napply cross-listed courses to the specific \nsubject discipline. For example, a CLASS \ncourse cross-listed with Religious Studies will \napply to the Classics major or minor unless the \nstudent has advised the Undergraduate \nStudent Services Office in writing that it should \napply to the Religious Studies portion of the \nstudent's program. When students ask that a \ncross-listed course be applied to their other \nsubject of concentration, that course will then \nbe applied to the minimums and maximums for \nthat other subject. \nFor further details on cross-listed courses, see \nthe entries for interdisciplinary programs below. \n6. Junior Courses: Maximum of ★48 at the \njunior level are permitted for credit to the \nprogram. Students should complete ★30 at the \njunior level before registering in senior-level \ncourses. \n7. Combined Major in French and \nSpanish: Apart from the option to declare a \ndouble major in French and Spanish with no \nminor [see above], students may opt to take \nthese two related languages which can be \ncombined as their major subject; a valid minor \nsubject is still required when this option is \nselected. The following conditions apply: \na. Students selecting a combined \nlanguage major should take two \nlanguages other than English in the \nfirst year, deferring any other basic \nrequirement except the Junior ENGL to \ndo so. \nb. Students majoring in two languages \nother than English must take a \nminimum of ★12 at the senior level in \neach language and normally must \ninclude a minimum of ★3 in each \nlanguage at the 400-level. In all other \ncomplete a minor in the same department as their \nmajor. \n5. Course Maximum: No more than *48 at the \nsenior level applicable to any one major is permitted, \nwhether or not a major in that discipline has been \ndeclared. \n 6. Cross-Listed Courses: Courses listed in more \nthan one major/minor are known as cross-listed \ncourses. \n. Unless otherwise notified by the student, the \nUndergraduate Student Services Office will apply \ncross-listed courses to the specific subject \ndiscipline. For example, a CLASS course cross-\nlisted with Religious Studies will apply to the \nClassics major or minor unless the student has \nadvised the Undergraduate Student Services Office \nin writing that it should apply to the Religious \nStudies portion of the student's program. When \nstudents ask that a cross-listed course be applied to \ntheir other subject of concentration, that course will \nthen be applied to the minimums and maximums for \nthat other subject. \nFor further details on cross-listed courses, see the \nentries for interdisciplinary programs below. \n. 7. Junior Courses: A maximum of ★48 at the \njunior level is permitted for credit to the program. \nStudents should complete ★30 at the junior level \nbefore registering in senior-level courses. \n. 8. Combined Major in French and Spanish: Apart \nfrom the option to declare two major(s) in French \nand Spanish [see above], students may opt to take \nthese two related languages as one major. Students \nwith a combined major in French and Spanish must \ntake a minimum of ★12 at the senior level in each \nlanguage and normally must include a minimum of \n★3 in each language at the 400-level. In all other \nrespects, the requirements for a major in the above \nsection apply. \n9. Non-Arts or Non-Science Options: A maximum \nof ★18 may be taken outside the Faculties of Arts \nand Science as long as the courses do not duplicate \ncourses already offered by these two \nFaculties. Courses offered by the Faculty of Native \nStudies will be counted as Arts courses \n[see Options and Native Studies (Faculty of Native \nStudies)]. See also Registration Information 6. for a \nlist of courses from the Faculty of Agricultural, Life \nand Environmental Sciences that are applied as \nFaculty of Arts courses. \n10. Interdisciplinary Programs and \nCourses: Many programs housed within \nDepartments in the Faculty of Arts have important \ninterdisciplinary components; some are primarily \ninterdisciplinary in orientation.

Interdisciplinary Programs and \nCourses: Many programs housed within \nDepartments in the Faculty of Arts have \nimportant interdisciplinary components; some \nare primarily interdisciplinary in orientation. The \nOffice of Interdisciplinary Studies oversees \nprograms that draw on courses from multiple \nDepartments. These include the Individualized \nMajor and Minor (see Individualized Study), as \nwell as programs in International Studies, \nReligious Studies, Science, Technology and \nSociety Studies, and the MA in Humanities \nComputing that are described elsewhere in this \ncalendar. \nThe Office of Interdisciplinary Studies is also \nresponsible for certain interdisciplinary (INT D) \ncourses. Information about these courses and \nprograms is available from the Faculty of Arts \nOffice for Interdisciplinary Studies. \nUnless otherwise indicated in the course \ndescription, an INT D course may be applied \ntoward either the major or the minor if it \nappears under the department's course listings \nin Course Listings. \n10. Community Service-Learning courses: A \nnumber of courses in departments and \nprograms across the Faculty of Arts offer \ncommunity engagement as an option or \nrequirement. Students in Community Service-\nLearning (CSL) courses take part in \ncommunity-based experiences that link to \ncourse content. \nThe CSL program offers its own CSL \ndesignated courses (see Course Listings) and \na certificate (see Certificate in Community \nEngagement and Service-Learning [Arts]). \nFor further information see the CSL \nwebsite www.csl.ualberta.ca \nNo Further Changes Until \nTechnology and Society Studies, and the MA in \nHumanities Computing that are described elsewhere \nin this calendar. \nThe Office of Interdisciplinary Studies is also \nresponsible for certain interdisciplinary (INT D) \ncourses.

To \nbring clarity to this document, two sections from the original draft proposal have been moved to \nthe appendices: History of the BA Curriculum Review Process is now located in Appendix A; \nand Ongoing BA Curriculum Renewal Consultation Process is now located in Appendix B. \nThe goal of the BA Curriculum Renewal is to develop a simpler, less prescriptive, and a \nsustainable BA program that provides Arts students with an exemplary undergraduate degree, \nwhile maintaining, at its heart, a liberal arts philosophy that is contextualized within our large-\nscale research intensive university. A renewed BA at the University of Alberta must be flexible \nenough to accommodate the exceptional breadth and depth in programming offered in the \nFaculty of Arts. This renewed BA must also continue to enable a broad range of pedagogical \nmethods, from traditional instructional strategies to community-engaged experiential learning, \nwhile retaining our rigorous academic standards.  \nCurrent Context for the BA Curriculum Renewal Process \nA number of factors inform the current institutional, provincial, and national contexts in which \nthe BA Curriculum Renewal occurs. First, in June 2015, the Government of Alberta introduced \nBill 3, the Appropriation (Interim Supply) Act. Bill 3 reversed cuts made by the previous \nprovincial administration (including a 1.4 percent reduction to post-secondary funding), \nincreased base funding for post-secondary institutions by two percent, cancelled market \nmodifiers that had previously been approved for 25 programs in Alberta, and restored \napprenticeship and targeted enrolment funding. As well, the Bill implemented a two-year freeze \non tuition and mandatory non-instructional fees for post-secondary students in both the 2015-16 \nand 2016-17 academic years.\n3\n In Fall 2015, the Government also began a review of the overall \n1\n University of Alberta. “Arts – Chart 1: Basic Requirements.” University of Alberta Calendar 2016-\n2017, http://www.registrar.ualberta.ca/calendar/Undergrad/Arts/chart1.html.

If the Arts BA \nprogram is re-worked now to meet our goals, the Faculty will be better positioned to face future \nchallenges and to take advantage of emergent opportunities. \nWithin our institution, central administrative units are also planning for substantive change. On \nMay 30, 2016, General Faculties Council recommended approval of the University of Alberta’s \nnew institutional strategic plan (ISP) “For the Public Good” (Au Service de l'intérêt public), \nwhich was ratified by the Board of Governors on June 17, 2016.\n5\n The strategic goals of the ISP \nare as follows: \n     In For the Public Good—our institutional strategic plan for the coming decade—we \nembrace and affirm our vision to inspire the human spirit through outstanding \nachievements in learning, discovery, and citizenship in a creative community, building one \nof the world’s great universities for the public good. \nWe forge ahead, motivated and supported by the University of Alberta’s 108-year history \nof leadership, achievement, and public service. Inspired by this plan, we will strive to \nachieve the following strategic goals: \nBUILD a diverse, inclusive community of exceptional students, faculty, and staff from \nAlberta, Canada, and the world. \nEXPERIENCE diverse and rewarding learning opportunities that inspire us, nurture our \ntalents, expand our knowledge and skills, and enable our success. \nEXCEL as individuals, and together, sustain a culture that fosters and champions \ndistinction and distinctiveness in teaching, learning, research, and service. \nENGAGE communities across campuses, city and region, province, nation, and the world \nto create reciprocal, mutually beneficial learning experiences, research projects, \npartnerships, and collaborations. \nSUSTAIN our people, our work, and the environment by attracting and stewarding the \nresources we need to deliver excellence to the benefit of all. \n4\n Government of Alberta. “Tuition and Fees Freeze Begins for Post-secondary Students.” Government of \nAlberta, Announcements, 8 Sep. 2015, http://alberta.ca/release.cfm?xID=38498C947FED3-E72C-6CA8-\n6297F33D57AD6D0D.

As outlined in the introduction to the “Discussion Paper”: \nthe environment within which we recruit students has been changing as a result of \nprovincial and national trends. Post-secondary participation rates within the province are \ncomparatively low [Alberta Innovation and Advanced Education], the number of degree- \ngranting institutions in Alberta has increased [Canadian Association of University \nTeachers Bulletin], and national demographics have shifted [Statistics Canada]. These \nfactors have combined to result in a smaller pool of potential undergraduate students \nnationally, prompting increasing and aggressive recruitment of Alberta students by other \nout-of-province institutions.\n7\nAs a backdrop to the BA Curriculum Renewal, a number of significant demographic shifts have \nemerged since the introduction of the current BA structure in the 2006-2007 academic year. \nFrom 2006 to 2016, the population of the Edmonton Metropolitan area increased by 26.9% (see \nAppendix C), while Faculty of Arts undergraduate enrollment declined by 5.5% (see Appendix \nD). Although the general population (and local pool of potential applicants) has increased \nsignificantly, the Faculty of Arts has seen a decrease in enrolled students. This negative trend is \nfurther complicated by the fact that, in the 2006-2007 academic year, international students \naccounted for 5.4% of Arts undergraduates whereas they comprise over 21.5% of Arts \nundergraduates in 2016-2017 (see Appendix E). In 2016-17, there are 850 fewer domestic \nundergraduate students enrolled annually in the Faculty of Arts than there were in 2006-2007.  \nAlthough it is impossible to know or weigh all the potential factors causing enrollments to fall or \nto account for the significant decrease in domestic students, the number of peer institutions \noffering liberal arts education in the Edmonton region suggest a strong demand locally for arts \neducation. For instance, MacEwan University and King’s University became BA degree-granting \ninstitutions in 2004. \nWhile it is clear from the BA Curriculum Renewal consultation process that the Faculty of Arts \nbelieves strongly in sustaining a liberal arts model, we must respond to the growing pressure to \narticulate the value of our BA degree effectively in this new educational environment, as well as \nto communicate its benefits and outcomes clearly to students, parents, employers, and \ngovernment. In light of these demographic shifts and the increasingly competitive environment \n6\n University of Alberta. “Institutional Strategic Plan: For the Public Good.” University of Alberta.

DES, MUSIC, WRITE) \nb) *6 Group 2 – study of cultures (CHINA, CHRTC, \nCHRTP, CLASS, C LIT, EASIA, ENGL, FREN, FS, \nGERM, GREEK, HIST, ITAL, JAPAN, KOREA, LA ST, \nMLCS, PHIL, POLISH, PORT, RELIG, RUSS, SCAND, \nSLAV, SPAN) \nc) *6 Group 3 – social systems (ANTHR, CSL, EAS (Arts \ncourses only), ECON, HGP, INT D, LING, MEAS, POL \nS, PSYCO (Arts courses only), STS, SOC, WGS) \nThe current BA Basic Requirements are based on a distribution model that grounds a traditional \nliberal arts education in a breadth of disciplines and methodologies. On the one hand, in \nprinciple, the distribution model enforces breadth of study in students’ degree programs. On the \nother hand, it is not clear how these requirements relate to the many and diverse types of Arts \nmajors, or how they benefit students during and after their degrees. The weakest aspect to this \nmodel is that the basic requirements rarely align with courses taken as part of a student’s \ndeclared major nor do they connect with one another. Furthermore, the pedagogical value of \nthese particular basic requirements has not been clearly linked to our research-intensive \ninstitutional focus. \nA variety of approaches to the structuring of BA programs are employed in Canadian \nuniversities, along with a broad threshold of basic credit requirements among the top 20-ranked \nCanadian universities (see Appendix F). The lowest number of BA program basic requirement \ncredits is in the Faculty of Arts at the University of Calgary, which since 2010, requires only *6 \ncredits from the Faculty of Science, with all other requirements determined by departments or \nprograms offering majors. By contrast, students in BA programs within the University of Alberta \nFaculty of Arts face the highest number of basic requirements among the top 20 comparable \nCanadian programs, with *36 basic course credits needed to graduate.  \n8\n University of Alberta. “Arts – Chart 1: Basic Requirements.” University of Alberta Calendar 2016-2017, \nhttp://www.registrar.ualberta.ca/calendar/Undergrad/Arts/chart1.html. Accessed 18 Oct. 2016. \nhttp://www.registrar.ualberta.ca/calendar/Undergrad/Arts/chart1.html\nBA Curriculum Renewal Proposal \nFaculty of Arts – November 2016 \n6 \nHaving the highest number of BA basic requirements among top Canadian institutions produces \na number of challenges for our Faculty. First, the high number of requirements is dissuading high \nschool students from choosing our program for their post-secondary education; they now have \nother more attractive and less complex options locally, provincially, and nationally.\n9\n The current \nrequirements also make transferring into the Faculty of Arts difficult and potentially unattractive \nto prospective students from colleges, other University of Alberta programs, and other \nuniversities.\n10\n As well, the Faculty of Arts encompasses a wide variety of disciplines; but, the \nhigh number of basic requirements neutralizes this diversity in programming by imposing \nsimilarity across majors and ignoring distinct disciplinary differences. In short, other institutions \nprovide more flexibility to students; and, students increasingly opt for the program flexibility \naccessible at other institutions. Our current program does not represent or maximize the value of \nour diverse offerings. We are losing students to more attractive and easier-to-navigate programs \noffered elsewhere, even though we provide comparable or superior course offerings.  \nThe Faculty of Arts Dean’s Office has engaged and consulted widely over the course of the BA \nCurriculum Renewal process, hearing from key campus partners and stakeholders, including \nstudents, faculty, contract instructors, staff, and alumni. Our BA Renewal Surveys generated \nover 800 student responses\n11\n and nearly 150 faculty responses.\n12\n In addition, we collected over \n370 written responses to the original discussion paper from a variety of different forums. The \nrevised recommendations detailed below are drawn directly from the input received during this \ncomprehensive consultation process. \nTo enhance our competitiveness among peer institutions and strengthen the quality and \nflexibility of our BA degree, the Faculty of Arts proposes these basic requirements for the \nUniversity of Alberta Bachelor of Arts: \n *120 \no The 120 credit minimum remains unchanged. \n one major (*30-*48 maximum at the senior level)  \no The major credit threshold remains unchanged. \n9\n University of Alberta Office of the Registrar. “Acceptance Decline Survey- Final Report November 2015” \n[unpublished].

Some Courses offered by other Faculties are recognized as “Arts courses”:  \ni) Native Studies (NS) \nii) Arts disciplines from Campus St Jean and Augustana (e.g. HISTE, SC PO, AUFRE, \nAUSOC) \niii) Approved Cross-listed ALES courses (in Sociology (R SOC) and Economics (AREC) \n2. Exemptions from the *6 LOE requirement include: \ni) Students who present the 30-level (matriculation) equivalent of a Language Other than \nEnglish, or \nii) Students who are required by the Registrar’s office to take any English proficiency test to \nqualify for admission \niii) The Calendar currently states: “Students who have completed their secondary education \nin a LOE will be permitted to take *6 option in lieu of the LOE core. Students with prior \nLOE background who wish further study in that LOE must be placed at the appropriate \nlevel or credit will be withheld. Records for these applicants will be reviewed and \nassessed by the Undergraduate Student Services Office. Students who have facility in a \nLOE but who cannot provide official transcripts should contact the relevant LOE \ndepartment for advice about obtaining a waiver for the LOE requirement.” \nAdvantages of the Proposed BA Basic Requirement Changes \n1. The proposed requirements will continue to promote breadth and diversity but in a manner \nthat is less prescriptive.  \n2. The maximum of *48 in any single Arts discipline and the *6 required in non-Arts \ndisciplines mean that students must experiment by taking courses in several disciplines, \nregardless of their chosen major in order to complete the *120 credit minimum. \n3. The added flexibility will create significantly more opportunities for students to take double \nmajors and/or multiple minors. For example, a student could graduate with a single major, \ntwo majors, or the option of a major and one or more minors. \n4. If students no longer require minors (which, by their very nature, are limited to single \ndepartments), they would be free to undertake more of the certificates that are developed and \noffered across disciplines and departments.  \n5. Students will also take on greater responsibility for designing their programs, an important \nfacet of the educational experience. \n6. The proposed requirements enable a straightforward transition for students transferring to \nArts from other programs at the University of Alberta and other post-secondary institutions.  \n7. The requirement for *6 of non-Arts credits guarantees that students will be exposed to the \ndisciplinary perspectives and pedagogical environments of other Faculties and programs, \nwhich will ensure and enrich students’ experiences of the full breadth of university learning. \n8. A flexible Arts degree means that our students will easily be able to accommodate any \nmandated University-wide Indigenous studies requirement in their degrees, should this \nrequirement be embraced institutionally.  \nBA Curriculum Renewal Proposal \nFaculty of Arts – November 2016 \n10 \nThe new common requirements introduce significant flexibility to students, while sustaining the \nacademic excellence and rigour of Faculty of Arts programs. This structural shift creates a \ncontinuum of options that can adapt to both specific departmental programmatic outcomes and \ndisciplinary specificity, while simultaneously facilitating breadth in pedagogical scope and \ncurricular demands.  \nGovernance Pathway for the Proposed Changes to BA Basic Requirements \nThe proposed changes to the BA Basic Requirements follow the standard governance pathway. \nWithin the Faculty of Arts, changes were reviewed and approved first by Academic Affairs \nCommittee (AAC) on October 26, 2016 and by Arts Executive Committee (AEC) on November \n3, 2016. Arts Faculty Council (AFC) will consider and vote on the proposal November 24, 2016.  \nSince there are no changes to academic standing, admissions (including high school subjects to \nbe used for admission), or graduation requirements, the proposed changes will not need to be \napproved by Academic Standards Committee (ASC) of GFC. Approval of GFC is required \nthrough routine circulation in Winter 2017 for implementation in Fall 2018.  \nThe BA Curriculum Renewal proposal, as it stands, would require a number of University of \nAlberta Calendar changes. These changes will affect calendar section entries for the Bachelor of \nArts (BA), BA Honors Program Requirements, and the After Degree Programs. \nNext Steps in the BA Curriculum Renewal Process \nThe BA Curriculum Renewal is an opportunity for us as a Faculty to shape our future together. \nThis proposal promotes a new BA structure that will replace our current BA Basic Curriculum. \nThe new common requirements will increase flexibility for students, departments, and the \nFaculty, and ensure our requirements are competitive with other post-secondary institutions. \nThe proposed changes will affect the way we advise our students and offer guidance in building \ntheir programs through appropriate course selection. In consultation with Departments, \nspecifically through the Arts Teaching and Learning Engagement Committee (ATLEC), which \nconsists of every departmental undergraduate Associate Chair, student representatives, and \nSenior Advisors in Undergraduate Student Services, the Faculty of Arts will create a series of \nthematic pathways as optional guides for students. The pathways will act as roadmaps for our \nUndergraduate Student Services advisors to guide students in their first year. \nAssociate Dean Allen Ball will lead the consultation process in developing the thematic \npathways, which will ensure that our diverse programs can be promoted equally, thus exposing \nstudents to the full range of departments and disciplines. It is envisaged that the optional \nthematic pathways will echo and build upon the extensive work developed over the last five \nyears in defining BA attributes (see Appendix G), while also providing opportunities to inform \nstudents of the multiple ways of achieving breadth and diversity in their Arts education. \nBA Curriculum Renewal Proposal \nFaculty of Arts – November 2016 \n11 \nIt is imperative that the Faculty of Arts and its departments design this renewed BA and its \nthematic pathways together, such that we construct a degree program that is flexible enough to \nmeet future challenges and well positioned to take advantage of emergent opportunities. \nTogether, these recommendations form a critical part of a broader effort by the Faculty of Arts to \noffer a truly outstanding BA program that will attract and retain the very best and brightest \nstudents from Alberta, Canada, and the world.  \nHistory of the BA Curriculum Review Process\t \nIn November 2011, Arts Faculty Council approved a five-year Academic Plan that included a \nsystematic review of the BA general requirements.1 \nAfter determining the reasons why such a review was necessary, five working groups were \nformed in September 2012 to develop visions for the future of the BA degree. A series of open \nmeetings and focus group sessions were held with the members of the five working groups and \nothers in the Faculty of Arts. These lengthy discussions centered on the question of whether or \nnot to define the BA degree in terms of “attributes.”  \n“Attributes” were defined as the qualities, values, and dispositions that students develop during \nthe process of obtaining an Arts degree. Broader than — but including — skills, attributes are not \ndiscipline-specific and are developed by all students as they progress through their degrees. The \nworking group discussions were informed by specialists in curriculum development, including \nDr. Jennifer Summit from Stanford University and Dr. John Galaty from McGill University, who \npresented lectures in January 2013 (see Appendix H). \nThe five working groups were merged into a single Task Force in February 2013. The Task \nForce members investigated the ways in which other universities, primarily in the United States \nand Australia, had organized their BA basic requirements around the concept of attributes. \nComprehensive surveys of University of Alberta undergraduates were conducted in 2011-2012, \nusing some of the various guiding principles used by other institutions across the world (see \nAppendix I). \nA set of key attributes were put forward at the end of 2013, along with a proposed table of BA \nrequirements, which clearly outlined the number of course credits and expected learning \noutcomes for each set of attributes (see Appendix J). Five core attributes were identified: \n• Analysis and Interpretation \n• Research, Creation, and Inquiry \n• Communication and Culture \n• Global Citizenship \n• Lifelong, Adaptive, and Engaged Learning \nThis working proposal was then sent out to all stakeholders in the Faculty of Arts for feedback. \nIn September 2014, an ad hoc committee was constituted at the request of Dean Lesley Cormack \nand Associate Dean Mickey Adolphson, then-Chair of the BA Curriculum Review. This \ncommittee was asked to bring the work of earlier iterations of the BA Review Committee to \nfruition by drafting a proposal based on the attributes for presentation to Arts Faculty Council. In \nSpring 2015, a draft entitled “The BA Core Review – The Proposed Attributes BA” (see \nAppendix J) was presented to various Arts stakeholder groups, including Undergraduate Student \nServices, Dean’s Executive Council, and Chairs Council.  \n1\tUniversity of Alberta Faculty of Arts. “Academic Plan.” University of Alberta Faculty of Arts, \nhttps://www.ualberta.ca/arts/about/academic-plan. Accessed 18 Oct. 2016.\t\n11\nBA Curriculum Renewal Proposal \nFaculty of Arts – October 2016 \n2 \nThere were concerns expressed that the attribute model was too complex and would make \nadvising individual students nearly impossible. It also became clear that there was a perception \nthat a full conversation about the attributes themselves had not yet happened, including whether \nthe identified attributes were the appropriate ones on which to form the foundation for our BA \nrequirements. Further, it was obvious that many, if not most, of the degree programs offered by \nthe Faculty incorporated many of these attributes, so it was not clear why the required core \nwould need to duplicate the efforts of these offerings by requiring specific types of core courses. \nThe draft proposal was brought to Arts Executive Committee and the Committee voted against \nforwarding the proposal to Arts Faculty Council.  \nAlthough the Faculty did not move forward with the recommendations as presented, it was \nagreed, in principle, by the Dean’s Executive Council that the identified attributes were a \nvaluable means of understanding undergraduate programs, shifting attention away from thinking \nabout content and towards the diverse skills and competencies our students gain throughout their \ndegrees. Disciplinary requirements are the primary mechanism that shape students’ paths \nthroughout their degrees. These discipline-specific program requirements develop many of the \ncore attributes that become the transferable skills with which students enter the workforce upon \ngraduation. Exactly how these attributes are embedded in the trajectories of specific majors and \nminors is best determined by each individual department or program.  \n12\nOngoing BA Curriculum Renewal Consultation Process \nIn July 2015, Associate Dean (Student Programs: Teaching and Learning) Allen Ball took on the \nleadership of the BA Curriculum Review process. The review process was renamed the BA \nCurriculum Renewal, and direction was given to draft a new BA Curriculum Renewal proposal \nfor consideration by all members of the Faculty of Arts by the end of the 2015-2016 academic \nyear. \nAssociate Dean Ball has undertaken a consultative process with input from the 2015-2016 \nDean’s Executive Councils, which included the following members of faculty: \n• Acting Dean Lise Gotell (Women’s and Gender Studies) \n• Acting Vice-Dean Stuart Landon (Economics) \n• Associate Dean (Graduate) Tom Spalding (Psychology) \n• Associate Dean (Research) Michael O’Driscoll (English and Film Studies) \n• Associate Dean (Student Programs) Rebecca Nagel (History and Classics) \n• Associate Dean (Teaching and Learning) Allen Ball (Art and Design) \nAdditional input has also been received from the following faculty members of the 2016-2017 \nDean’s Executive Council:  \n• Dean Lesley Cormack (History and Classics) \n• Vice-Dean Lise Gotell (Women’s and Gender Studies) \n• Associate Dean (Graduate) Tom Spalding (Psychology) \n• Associate Dean (Research) Steve Patten (Political Science) \n• Associate Dean (Student Programs) Rebecca Nagel (History and Classics) \n• Associate Dean (Teaching and Learning) Allen Ball (Art and Design) \nDuring the 2015-2016 academic year, Associate Dean Ball held individual meetings with all 15 \nFaculty of Arts Department Chairs, as well as the Executive Director of Community Service-\nLearning and the Director of the Office of Interdisciplinary Studies:  \n• Dr. Pamela Willoughby, Chair (Anthropology)  \n• Professor Cezary Gajewski, Chair (Art and Design) \n• Dr. David Peacock, Executive Director (Community Service-Learning)  \n• Professor Betty Moulton, Chair (Drama)  \n• Dr. Constance Smith, Chair (Economics)  \n• Dr. Walter Davis, Interim Chair (East Asian Studies)  \n• Dr. Peter Sinnema, Chair (English and Film Studies)  \n• Dr. David Marples (History and Classics)  \n• Dr. Sean Gouglas, Director (Office of Interdisciplinary Studies)  \n• Dr. Herbert Colston, Chair (Linguistics)  \n• Dr. Laura Beard, Chair (Modern Languages and Cultural Studies) \n• Professor William Street, Chair (Music) \n• Dr. Jack Zupko, Chair (Philosophy) \n• Dr. Lois Harder, Chair (Political Science) \n• Dr. Jeff Bisanz, Chair (Psychology) \n• Dr. Gillian Stevens, Acting Chair (Sociology) \n13\nBA Curriculum Renewal Proposal \nFaculty of Arts – October 2016 \n2 \n• Dr. Philomena Okeke, Acting Chair (Women’s and Gender Studies) \nOngoing updates on the BA Curriculum Renewal process have been provided by Associate Dean \nBall to members of the central administration, including: \n• Meg Brolley, General Faculty Council Secretary  \n• Dr. Sarah Forgie, Vice Provost (Learning Initiatives) \n• Dr. Nat Kav, Vice Provost (Academic Programs and Instruction) \n• Kate Peters, Portfolio Initiatives Manager, Office of the Provost and Vice-President \n(Academic).  \nFurther, discussions are underway with Dr. Christine Brown, Head Librarian, to identify and \naddress any resource implications that the proposed BA Curriculum Renewal may generate for \nlibrary services. \nThe potential changes to our BA have also been discussed with Faculties across campus. To date, \nthe following Associate Deans and Deans have been consulted on this initiative by Associate \nDean Ball: \n• Dr. Jason Carey, Associate Dean (Programs & Planning), Faculty of Engineering \n• Dr. Janice Causgrove Dunn, Associate Dean (Undergraduate Programs), Faculty of Physical \nEducation and Recreation \n• Dr. Robin Everall, Interim Vice-Provost and Dean of Students \n• Dr. Elaine Geddes, Associate Dean (Undergraduate), Alberta School of Business \n• Dr. Clive Hickson, Associate Dean (Undergraduate Programs and Services), Faculty of \nEducation \n• Dr. Tim Joseph, Associate Dean (Student & Co-op Services), Faculty of Engineering \n• Dr. Brenda Leskiw, Senior Associate Dean (Undergraduate), Faculty of Science \n• Dr. Karsten Mundel, Director & Associate Dean (Academic), Augustana Campus \n• Dr. Frank Tough, Associate Dean (Academic), Faculty of Native Studies \nAn update on the BA Curriculum Renewal consultation process was presented by Associate \nDean Ball at Arts Faculty Council on October 5, 2015. The process has also been discussed \nextensively in each 2015-2016 Arts Teaching and Learning Enhancement Committee meeting \nand at the Associate Chairs (Undergraduate) 2015-2016 meetings.  \nRoundtable sessions have taken place with the Undergraduate Student Services staff to address \nthe possible administrative impacts of different changes to the BA basic requirements. In \naddition, the Recruitment and Engagement team have articulated the needs and interests of \nprospective students.  \nThe Faculty of Arts: BA Curriculum Renewal Discussion Paper was distributed across the \nFaculty on January 8, 2016. The proposal was initially discussed at Faculty of Arts Chairs \nCouncil on January 20, 2016, and again at Faculty of Arts Chairs Council on February 3, 2016. \nAssociate Dean Ball also presented and discussed the proposal at Arts Executive Council on \nFebruary 25, 2016.    \n14\nBA Curriculum Renewal Proposal \nFaculty of Arts – October 2016 \n3 \nA town hall meeting was held on February 5, 2016. More than 100 students, staff, and faculty \nattended this open forum. An online form was also circulated prior to the event, inviting \nfeedback about the BA Curriculum Renewal Discussion Paper from those who would not be able \nto attend the town hall.1 \nDuring Winter 2016, Associate Dean Ball presented the BA Curriculum Renewal Discussion \nPaper at the following Departmental Councils: Anthropology; Art and Design; English and Film \nStudies; History and Classics; Linguistics; Modern Languages and Cultural Studies; and \nPhilosophy. \nWe have developed an open and robust dialogue with students about the renewal process through \nnumerous discussions with our Faculty of Arts Students’ Association, OASIS (Organization for \nArts Students and Interdisciplinary Studies). Associate Dean Ball was invited to participate in a \nstudent town hall organized by OASIS on March 8, 2016. All BA students were invited to attend \nto ask questions and give feedback. The event was well attended and the students’ thoughtful \nobservations, along with the complete record of students’ contributions, were added to the \nFaculty’s consideration of the BA Curriculum Renewal.2 \nA survey was distributed on March 10, 2016 (closing March 20, 2016), to gauge students’ and \nfaculty members’ initial response to the BA Renewal Discussion Paper. The survey garnered \nnearly 1000 responses, with 831 students and 167 faculty members submitting their opinions. \nThe aggregated results were made available on April 7, 2016.3 \nOn April 27, 2016 Associate Dean Ball met with the executive members of OASIS to discuss the \nresults of the surveys. Associate Dean Ball met with representatives from the Graduate Student \nAssociation (GSA) on May 19, 2016 to explore the impacts the proposed changes to the BA may \nhave on graduate student recruitment and retention. A meeting to discuss the BA Renewal \nProposal with OASIS was held on September 22, 2016.\t\nDean Lesley Cormack moderated a second town hall meeting on September 30, 2016. Once \nagain, more than 100 students, staff, and faculty attended this open forum. A video recording of \nthe town hall can be viewed online.4 Also, an online form was circulated prior to the event, \ninviting feedback about the BA Curriculum Renewal Discussion Paper from those who would \n1 University of Alberta Faculty of Arts. “BA Renewal: Feedback From the February 5 Town Hall.” University of \nAlberta Faculty of Arts, 5 Feb. 2016, https://www.ualberta.ca/arts/about/ba-renewal/feedback-from-the-february-5-\ntown-hall.

A census metropolitan area (CMA) is formed by one or more adjacent municipalities centred on a\npopulation centre (known as the core). A CMA must have a total population of at least 100,000 of\nwhich 50,000 or more must live in the core. To be included in the CMA, other adjacent municipalities\nmust have a high degree of integration with the core, as measured by commuting flows derived from\nprevious census place of work data. Once an area becomes a CMA, it is retained as a CMA even if its\ntotal population declines below 100,000 or the population of its core falls below 50,000. Small\npopulation centres with a population count of less than 10,000 are called fringe. All areas inside the\nCMA that are not population centres are rural areas. All CMAs are subdivided into census tracts.\n3. Postcensal estimates are based on the latest census counts adjusted for census net undercoverage\n(including adjustment for incompletely enumerated Indian reserves) and for the estimated population\ngrowth that occurred since that census. Intercensal estimates are based on postcensal estimates and\ncensus counts adjusted of the censuses preceding and following the considered year.\n4.

Population estimates for July 1 are final intercensal from 2001 to 2010, final postcensal for 2011,\nupdated postcensal for 2012 to 2014 and preliminary postcensal for 2015.\n6. Age at July 1.\n7. The population growth, which is used to calculate population estimates of Census metropolitan areas\n(CANSIM 051­0056), is comprised of the components of population growth (CANSIM 051­0057).\n8.

This might encourage students to take \ncourses outside their comfort zone. F/P courses cannot be counted \ntowards any requirements for the BA or the major. \n• Some new courses will have to be created for the core attributes and \nthere needs to be a body that approves those courses. More specific \ncriteria need to be established for what constitutes a course in each \ncategory. \n• To articulate the attributes, all students will maintain an e-portfolio, \nwhere various essays, reflective pieces, creative works, and research \npapers may be included.

This report has extracted questions from the survey that may be of relevant for \nthe Faculty of Arts’ Bachelor of Arts Curriculum Review.  In the below graphs, the orange bars \nrepresent the labeled response as a proportion of all responses to that question from all survey \nrespondents. The green bars represent the same proportions, only they are limited to responses from \nstudents in the Faculty of Arts. Some of the questions allowed respondents to provide more than \none answer (these questions are noted with “check all that apply”) and so will add up to more than \n100%.  \nQUESTIONS \nAre you involved in a student group/organization on campus? \n36\nHow did you get involved with these campus organizations/activities?

Some of the questions allowed respondents to provide more than \none answer (these questions are noted with “check all that apply”) and so will add up to more than \n100%.  \nQUESTIONS \nWhat is the most effective way to inform you about on campus events, information and/or \ncampaigns?

The bulk of this analysis was done by the Students’ Union’s previous \nUniversity Policy & Information Officer, Jessica Zvonkovic in 2012. \nINTRODUCTION \nThe following chart is a summary of responses from a question asked in the 2011 Students’ Union \nundergraduate student survey. This survey was distributed in the Fall of 2012 to all University of \nAlberta undergraduate students. It was sent by email and offered participants the chance to win a \nseries of prizes for participating. All told the survey saw 7540 participants, and this particular \nquestion was answered by 5001 participants. This question allowed participants to offer multiple \nresponses, meaning that when individually categorized, there were a total of 9,193 responses. \nThe question asked was: \n“The university is interested in defining the university experience. What qualities do you \nfeel a student should acquire as a result of their experience at the University of Alberta?” \nAs this is a very open question, respondents interpreted and answered it in unique ways. However, \nthe majority of responses can be categorized as either: Skills, Characteristics, Experiences, or \nMiscellaneous.   \n93\nResponse\nNumber \nof \nResponses\nPercent of \nSkill

Compliance with \nthis University policy extends to academic staff, \nadministrators, colleagues, and support staff as outlined \nand defined in the Recruitment Policy (Appendix A and \nAppendix B: Definitions and Categories) as well \nas undergraduate and graduate students, postdoctoral \nfellows, emeriti, members of the Board of Governors, \nthird party contractors, visiting speakers and volunteers. \nOverview \nAs a leading teaching and research institution whose work is local, national, and international, the University of \nAlberta is responsive to the needs of a diverse student population and workforce, as well as to the urban, rural, \nfrancophone, Aboriginal, and multicultural communities in which it does its work. The University is enriched by \ndiversity, and it welcomes and seeks to include many voices, including those that have been under-represented or \nexcluded.  \nThis policy is guided by the following principles:  \n1. Equity  \nEquity is about fairness: in access – to education, to employment – and in opportunity to succeed in these \ndomains. As a guiding principle of this policy, equity reflects an understanding that the University of Alberta is \nan increasingly diverse community and that it will respect and value the differences of its members.  \n2. Responsibility  \nResponsibility for achieving a work, study, and living environment free of harassment and discrimination falls \non  rests with every member of the University community individual to whom this Policy applies. All members \ncan reasonably expect to pursue their work and studies in a safe and respectful environment. Neither the \nUniversity nor any members of the University community associated individual shall practice or condone any \ndiscriminatory or harassing conduct that adversely affects the pursuit of work and study or life on campus. \nMembers of the University community Individuals who are aware of acts of discrimination or harassment are \nencouraged to take appropriate steps to stop the discriminatory or harassing behavior. Advice and assistance \nmay be sought from anyone in a position of authority, such as a supervisor, instructor or administrator. More \nformal advice and assistance may be sought from the Office of Safe Disclosure and Human Rights (OSDHR), \n U of A Policies and Procedures On-Line (UAPPOL) \nStudent OmbudService (SOS) Office of the Student Ombuds (OSO), the Association of Academic Staff \nUniversity of Alberta (AASUA), the Non-Academic Staff Association (NASA), Health Promotion and Worklife \nServices (HPaWS) Human Resource Services (HRS) and Organizational Health and Effectiveness (OHE), \nthe Office of the Dean of Students and Specialized Support and Disability Services (SSDS) Student \nAccessibility Services (SAS). \n3. Academic Freedom  \nThe University of Alberta’s motto, Quaecumque Vera (whatsoever things are true) declares the University’s \ncommitment to academic freedom and freedom of speech. As an institution of higher learning and research, \nthe University is devoted to discovery, debate, difference of opinion, and the careful and public weighing of \nideas and actions. Members of the University have the right to pursue the truth in their research and \npublications, artistic creations, teaching, learning, service, and public debate. This includes the right to \nquestion and criticize the status quo. Academic freedom, however, is not without limits. It is not, for example, \na justification or license for discrimination or harassment or for preventing the lawful exercise of free speech. \nPurpose \nThe purpose of this policy is to foster and protect a respectful environment for work, study, and living that supports \nthe dignity and equality of equity for all members of the University of Alberta. This policy expresses the University’s \ncommitment to a work, study, and living environment that is free of discrimination and harassment, and it ensures \nthat the University of Alberta will meet both its obligations under law and its ethical responsibilities as an institution of \nhigher learning. These legal and ethical responsibilities include the duty to accommodate and the provision of \nopportunities to persons who require accommodation based on a protected ground. \nPOLICY \n1. DISCRIMINATION OR HARASSMENT  \nIt is the policy of the University of Alberta that acts of discrimination or harassment committed by any \nindividual to whom this policy applies member of the University community are strictly prohibited. \nDiscrimination and harassment in the work, study and living environment includes, but is not limited to, \ndiscrimination and harassment on University of Alberta property, at University-related functions, in the course \nof work or study assignments outside the University, at work or study-related conferences or training \nsessions, during work or study-related travel, or by phone, computer, or other electronic means.  \nIndividuals affected by discrimination or harassment will be provided with a process for making and resolving \ncomplaints. Complaints relating to sexual violence will be addressed under the Sexual Violence Policy. \nComplaints of discrimination or harassment will be addressed and resolved in a timely manner, whenever \npossible. When a complaint of discrimination or harassment is established, appropriate action is taken, \nregardless of the authority or seniority of the offender. Individuals who engage in harassing or discriminatory \nbehaviours may be subject to disciplinary action.  \nThe University has an overriding institutional interest in maintaining an environment free from discrimination \nand harassment and may therefore itself initiate an investigation, or become a complainant, or continue with a \ncomplaint withdrawn by a complainant. \nRetaliation or reprisal against a person who has made a complaint, or against witnesses to a complaint, are \nsimilarly prohibited. Individuals who engage in retaliation may be subject to disciplinary action. \nThe University also recognizes the serious nature of allegations of discrimination and harassment that are \nmade in bad faith, and it may take disciplinary action should allegations of discrimination or harassment be \nshown to be malicious, frivolous, fraudulent, or vexatious. Submitting a complaint in good faith, even when the \ncomplaint cannot be proven established, is not a violation of this policy. \nProcedures on reporting and resolving discrimination or harassment complaints are published under this \npolicy.  \n U of A Policies and Procedures On-Line (UAPPOL) \n2. DUTY TO ACCOMMODATE  \nTo assist enable members of the University community to make their full contributions, the University of \nAlberta will take reasonable steps to accommodate individuals who are disadvantaged by employment, \ntenancy, or educational rules, standards, policies, or practices related to protected grounds to the point of \nundue hardship, or as required by law. \nThe University is committed to academic excellence. Accommodation of students with disabilities neither \nrequires nor implies that the University lower its academic or professional standards. Nor does \naccommodation relieve the students of the responsibility to develop demonstrate the essential skills and \ncompetencies required by programs, or relieve staff of the responsibility to meet the performance \nrequirements of a position in which they are accommodated.  \nAccommodation of members of the University community requires the University to take appropriate \nreasonable steps to eliminate discrimination resulting from a rule, practice or barrier that has a negative effect \non a person by reason of a protected ground. with a need for accommodation. The University’s duty to \naccommodate is far-reaching. However, the law recognizes that, in certain circumstances, a limitation on \nindividual rights may be reasonable and justifiable if the University can show that the discriminatory practice, \nstandard, decision or rule is a “bona fide requirement” (BFR) or a “bona fide occupational requirement” \n(BFOR) and/or that accommodation would impose undue hardship on the University.  \nThe University will apply current legal requirements in making such determinations. Currently, T to justify a \npractice, standard, decision or rule as a BFR or BFOR, the University must demonstrate, on a balance of \nprobabilities, that the impugned practice, standard, decision or rule:  \na) was adopted for a rational purpose connected to the performance of the job or the provision of the \nservice;  \nb) was adopted in an honest and good faith belief that it was necessary to the fulfillment of the job or \nservice;  \nc) is reasonable and necessary to the fulfillment of the job or service.  \nTo show that the practice, standard, decision or rule is reasonable and necessary, the University must \ndemonstrate that accommodation of the employee or student would impose undue hardship on the University. \nProcedures on requesting and dealing with addressing accommodation issues are published under this policy \nand include examples of accommodation measures and assessingments of undue hardship. \n3.

[▲Top] \nMembers of the University \nCommunity \nAll employees, (including but not limited to, academic staff, support staff \nand administrators), adjunct professors, professors emeriti, lecturers, \nclinical staff, all students (including undergraduate students and graduate \nstudents), and post-doctoral fellows.  \nRespectful Environment The respectful environment is characterized by a shared commitment to civility and human dignity. It values and respects academic freedom and it \nwelcomes a diversity of perspectives. It recognizes and rejects activities \nthat are harmful to mutual respect and is committed to educating members \nof the University about respect in work, study, and living environments. \nThe work, study and living environment extends beyond the University’s \ncampuses and properties and includes, but is not limited to, University-\nrelated functions, work or study assignments outside the University, work \nor study-related conferences or training sessions, work or study-related \ntravel, and communication by phone, computer, or other electronic means. \nDiscrimination A distinction, whether or not intentional, based on a characteristic or perceived characteristic referenced in the protected grounds that has the \neffect of imposing on an individual or group of individuals burdens, \nobligations or disadvantages that are not imposed on others, or of \nwithholding or limiting access to opportunities, benefits and advantages \navailable to other individuals in society.  \nHarassment Conduct or comment, either one-time or repeated that:   \na) is demeaning, intimidating, threatening, or abusive; and  \nb) is not trivial or fleeting in nature; and  \nc) causes offence and should have reasonably been expected to \noffend; and  \nd) serves no legitimate purpose for the work, study or living \nenvironment, and  \ne) undermines authority or respect in the work, study or living \nenvironment, or impairs work or learning performance, or limits \nopportunities for advancement or the pursuit of education or \nresearch, or creates an intimidating, hostile or offensive work or \nlearning environment.  \nHarassment includes bullying, which is a form of aggression that may \ninclude physical, verbal, or emotional abuse. Bullying poisons the work, \nstudy or living environment of the person it targets. It can include \npersistent, offensive, abusive, intimidating or insulting behavior, abuse of \npower, and/or unfair sanctions which make the individual feel threatened, \nhumiliated, and/or vulnerable.  \nSexual Harassment may be broadly defined as unwelcome conduct or \ncomment of a sexual nature which detrimentally affects the work, study or \nliving environment or otherwise leads to adverse consequences for the \nperson who is the target of the harassment.  \nIt may consist of unwanted sexual attention, sexually oriented remarks or \nbehaviours, or the creation of a negative psychological and emotional \nenvironment based on gender, gender identity or sexual orientation. It may \nbe an isolated act or repetitive conduct, but cannot be trifling. A reprisal or \nthreat of reprisal against an individual for rejecting a sexual solicitation or \nadvance may also constitute sexual harassment. \n U of A Policies and Procedures On-Line (UAPPOL) \nThe person(s) engaged in harassment need not have the intention to \nharass; it is the objective assessment of the circumstances that matters. \nHow would a reasonable observer perceive the situation? A complainant \nneed not expressly object to unwelcome conduct or comments, although \nany clear indication that the behaviour is unwanted will satisfy the test. A \ncomplainant's apparent passivity or failure to object overtly to sexual \nadvances does not necessarily signal consent or welcomed behaviour, \nespecially where a power imbalance exists between the individuals.  \nRacial Harassment involves unwanted or unwelcome comments, conduct \nor behavior that humiliates, intimidates, excludes or isolates an individual \nor group by focusing on their race, ethnicity, origin or religion. Overall, \nracial harassment undermines self-esteem and is a violation of the dignity \nand security of the individual or group(s) that it targets. \nDuty to Accommodate The duty to accommodate obligates the University to make reasonable adjustments, to the point of undue hardship or as required by law, to the \ndelivery of services (including teaching and the method of evaluation) and \nthe conditions of employment in order to reduce or eliminate the impact of \ndiscriminatory rules, policies, practices, standards, terms of employment, \nor decisions, which have an adverse impact on an individual or group of \nindividuals based on a characteristic or perceived characteristic referenced \nin the protected grounds.  \nAccommodation Accommodation is the process of making reasonable adjustments to the delivery of services and the conditions of employment in order to alleviate \nany adverse impacts on persons that result from the application of reduce \nor eliminate the impact of discriminatory rules, policies, practices, \nstandards, terms of employment, or decisions, due to which have an \nadverse impact on an individual or group of individuals based on a \ncharacteristic or perceived characteristic referenced in the protected \ngrounds. Accommodation is a shared responsibility between the University \nand the individual in need of accommodation, and is assessed on the \nunique circumstances of each individual. The process requires reasonable \naccommodation, not instant or perfect accommodation. The recipients of \naccommodation (e.g. students, faculty and staff) may be required to try \ndifferent accommodation options. The University is required to provide \nreasonable accommodation up to the point of undue hardship.  \nAccommodation neither requires nor implies that the University lower its \nacademic or professional standards. Nor does accommodation relieve \nstudents of the responsibility to demonstrate the essential skills and \ncompetencies required by programs or staff of the responsibility to meet \nthe performance requirements of a position in which they are \naccommodated. \nBona fide requirement (BFR) / \nBona fide occupational \nrequirement (BFOR) \nA limitation on individual rights may be reasonable and justifiable if the \nUniversity can show that a discriminatory practice, standard, decision or \nrule is a “bona fide requirement” (BFR) or “bona fide occupational \nrequirement” (BFOR). To justify such a determination Currently, to \nestablish a BFR or BFOR, , the University must demonstrate, on a balance \nof probabilities, that the impugned practice, standard, decision or rule:  \na) was adopted for a rational purpose connected to the performance of \nthe job or the provision of the service;  \nb) was adopted in an honest and good faith belief that it was \nnecessary to the fulfillment of the job or service;  \nc) is reasonable and necessary to the fulfillment of the job or service.  \nProtected Grounds Discrimination is prohibited based on the following protected grounds:  a) race  \n U of A Policies and Procedures On-Line (UAPPOL) \nb) colour  \nc) ancestry  \nd) place of origin  \ne) religious beliefs  \nf) gender, gender identity and gender expression (including \npregnancy and gender identity) \ng) physical disability  \nh) mental disability  \ni) marital status  \nj) family status  \nk) source of income  \nl) sexual orientation  \nm) age  \nn) political beliefs;  \nor any other groups as amended from time to time.  \nUndue Hardship The University has a duty to take reasonable steps to accommodate individual needs to the point of undue hardship. Undue hardship occurs \nwhen accommodation would create onerous conditions for the University.  \nWhile undue hardship will be decided in the circumstances of each case, \nonerous conditions may include, but are not limited to, the following.  \nWhen the proposed accommodation would: including but not limited to the \nfollowing, should be considered:  \na) pose  when there is a risk to the safety of others or a substantive \nrisk of personal injury to the person seeking accommodation, \nb) entail unreasonable financial cost such that a program or service \nwould cease to exist, or otherwise  be unreasonable for  the \nUniversity to bear the costs of accommodation,  \nc) effectively lower academic and/or when accommodation \nalternatives would result in lowering performance standards or \nresult in substantive job requirements being unmet,  \nd) unduly disrupt or interfere with when the accommodation would be \nunduly disruptive to an academic staff or collective agreement or \ncause substantial detrimental effects on other employees,  \ne) When an educational accommodation would result in essential \nelements of an educational service or program not being offered to \nother students, or cause a detrimental effect on other students. as \na result of accommodating an individual or a group of students.  \nAll students are bound by the Code of Student Behaviour.  \nInformal Resolution Informal resolutions are those that achieve remedies agreeable to complainants and respondents, but do not invoke formal resolution \nprocedures. Informal resolutions involve the relevant parties, and may \ninclude coaching, counseling, supporting, mediating, or otherwise \nfacilitating the resolution of the complaint. See procedures linked to this \nPolicy.  \nFormal Resolution Formal resolutions are effected through procedures described in the University’s academic staff and collective agreements with AASUA and \nNASA, in the Code of Student Behaviour, in the Postdoctoral Fellows \nPolicy or in the procedures linked to the Discrimination, Harassment and \nDuty to Accommodate Policy.  \nRemedy The general purposes of a remedy are:  a) to restore, as closely as possible, to a person whose complaint of \ndiscrimination or harassment has been sustained, the position she \nor he would have been in had the discrimination or harassment \nnot occurred; and  \nb) To prevent further acts of discrimination or harassment.  \n U of A Policies and Procedures On-Line (UAPPOL) \nA remedy will be appropriate to the individual case and severity of the \nfinding of discrimination or harassment. It may include, but is not limited to, \nan apology, the creation of a policy, a promise or requirement to cease the \nbehaviour, or a transfer.  \nComplainant A complainant is a person who alleges s/he has experienced believes he or she has been a victim of discrimination and/or harassment and initiates \na complaint against a member of the University community or other \nindividual covered under this Policy. \nRespondent A respondent is a member of the University community who has been accused of discrimination or harassment by a complainant.  \nRELATED LINKS \nShould a link fail, please contact uappol@ualberta.ca.

[▲Top] \nMembers of the University \nCommunity \nAll employees, (including but not limited to, academic staff, support staff \nand administrators), adjunct professors, professors emeriti, lecturers, \nclinical staff, all students (including undergraduate students and graduate \nstudents), and post-doctoral fellows.  \nAccommodation \nAccommodation is the process of making reasonable adjustments to the \ndelivery of services and the conditions of employment in order to reduce or \neliminate the impact of discriminatory rules, policies, practices, standards, \nterms of employment, or decisions, which have an adverse impact on an \nindividual or group of individuals based on a characteristic or perceived \ncharacteristic referenced in the Protected Grounds. Accommodation is a \nshared responsibility between the University and the individual in need of \naccommodation, and is assessed on the unique circumstances of each \nindividual. The process requires reasonable accommodation, not instant or \nperfect accommodation. The recipients of accommodation (e.g. students \nand staff) may be required to try different accommodation options. The \nUniversity is required to provide reasonable accommodation up to the \npoint of undue hardship.  \nAccommodation of students neither requires nor implies that the University \nlower its academic standards. Nor does accommodation relieve the \nstudent of that student’s responsibility to develop the essential skills and \ncompetencies required by programs. Accommodation neither requires nor \nimplies that the University lower its academic or professional standards. \nNor does accommodation relieve students of the responsibility to \ndemonstrate the essential skills and competencies required by programs \nor staff of the responsibility to meet the performance requirements of a \nposition in which they are accommodated. \nUndue Hardship \nThe University has a duty to take reasonable steps to accommodate \nindividual needs to the point of undue hardship. Undue hardship occurs \nwhen accommodation would create onerous conditions for the University.  \nWhile undue hardship will be decided in the circumstances of each case, \nonerous conditions, including but not limited to the following, should be \nconsidered:  \na) when there is a risk to the safety of others or a substantive risk of \npersonal injury to the person seeking accommodation.  \nb) when financial cost is such that a program or service would cease \nto exist due to the financial burden of the accommodation, or other \ncircumstances where it would be unreasonable to expect the \nUniversity to bear the costs of accommodation.  \nc) When accommodation alternatives would result in lowering \nperformance standards or in substantive job requirements being \n U of A Policies and Procedures On-Line (UAPPOL) \nunmet.  \nd) When the accommodation would be unduly disruptive to an \nacademic staff or collective agreement or cause substantial \ndetrimental effect on other employees.  \ne) When an educational accommodation would result in essential \nelements of a service or a program not being offered to other \nstudents, or cause a detrimental effect on other students, as a \nresult of accommodating an individual or a group of students.  \nAll students are bound by the Code of Student Behaviour. \nAccommodation of students neither requires nor implies that the University \nlower its standards nor does accommodation relieve the student of their \nresponsibility to develop the essential skills and competencies required by \nprograms.  \nBona fide requirement (BFR) / \nBona fide occupational \nrequirement (BFOR) \nA limitation on individual rights may be reasonable and justifiable if the \nuniversity can show that a discriminatory practice, standard, decision or \nrule is a “bona fide requirement” (BFR) or “bona fide occupational \nrequirement” (BFOR). To justify such a determination, the University must \ndemonstrate, on a balance of probabilities, that the impugned practice, \nstandard, decision or rule:  \na) was adopted for a rational purpose connected to the performance of \nthe job or the provision of the service;  \nb) was adopted in an honest and good faith belief that it was \nnecessary to the fulfillment of the job or service;  \nc) is reasonable and necessary to the fulfillment of the job or service.  \nDuty to Accommodate \nThe duty to accommodate obligates the University to make reasonable \nadjustments, to the point of undue hardship or as required by law, to the \ndelivery of services (including teaching and the method of evaluation) and \nthe conditions of employment in order to reduce or eliminate the impact of \ndiscriminatory rules, policies, practices, standards, terms of employment, \nor decisions, which have an adverse impact on an individual or group of \nindividuals based on a characteristic or perceived characteristic referenced \nin the Protected Grounds.  \nProtected Grounds \nDiscrimination is prohibited based on the following protected grounds:  \na) race  \nb) colour  \nc) ancestry  \nd) place of origin  \ne) religious beliefs  \nf) gender, gender expression and gender identity (including \npregnancy and gender identity)  \ng) physical disability  \nh) mental disability  \ni) marital status  \nj) family status  \nk) source of income  \nl) sexual orientation  \nm) age  \nn) political beliefs;  \nor any other groups as amended from time to time.  \nProtected Areas Discrimination is prohibited in the following protected areas: \na) employment  \nb) tenancy  \nc) access to goods and services \nd) access to accommodations or facilities customarily available to \n U of A Policies and Procedures On-Line (UAPPOL) \nmembers of the public \nDiscrimination \nA distinction, whether or not intentional, based on a characteristic or \nperceived characteristic referenced in the Protected Grounds that has the \neffect of imposing on an individual or group of individuals burdens, \nobligations or disadvantages that are not imposed on others, or of \nwithholding or limiting access to opportunities, benefits and advantages \navailable to other individuals in society.  \nRELATED LINKS \nShould a link fail, please contact uappol@ualberta.ca.

Recognizing At \nRisk Behaviour and responding with interest and concern are critical factors in preventing potential \nviolence (including harm to self, others and University property). The objective of this Policy is to create a \nsystem that will allow for the gathering of reports of At Risk Behaviour from across the University in order \nto facilitate a “connecting of the dots” of what could otherwise be viewed as isolated and less urgent \nincidents. If the connection between those incidents leads to the conclusion that an individual is in need of \nassistance, the existing support systems in place for members of the University community would work \nwith the Individual at Risk in an effort to provide that individual with the assistance required and \ntherefore minimize the possibility of a situation escalating. \nIt is important to recognize that the University also has systems in place for dealing with disciplinary \nmatters (e.g. The Code of Student Behaviour and the various collective agreements), and for dealing with \ncases of imminent danger (e.g. The Protocol for Urgent Cases of Disruptive, Threatening or Violent \nConduct (GFC Policy 91) and the Emergency Management PlanOffice). \nPurpose \nThe purpose of this policy is to facilitate early identification of At Risk Behaviour and create a system \ndesigned to receive and consolidate reports of At Risk Behaviour. Consolidating reports of At Risk \nBehaviour will enable a team to identifyidentification of situations in which seemingly isolated incidents \nare, in fact, connected so that the At Risk Behaviour can be properly assessed and the Individual At Risk \noffered assistance when deemed appropriate. Doing so should result in increased mental wellness and/or \na decreased risk of violence and at the same time reduce the likelihood of matters escalating.  \nThis policy also offers an opportunity for concerned members of the University Community to report At \nRisk Behaviour.  \nhttps://policiesonline.ualberta.ca/policiesprocedures/policies/recruitment-policy.pdf\nhttps://policiesonline.ualberta.ca/policiesprocedures/procedures/recruitment-policy-appendix-a-definition-and-categories-of-academic-staff-and-colleagues.pdf\nhttps://policiesonline.ualberta.ca/policiesprocedures/procedures/recruitment-policy-appendix-b-definition-and-categories-of-support-staff.pdf\n  U of A Policies and Procedures On-Line (UAPPOL) \nPOLICY \n1.

I am an Undergraduate Science Councillor who was involved in the \nevents of October 21.  \nTwo young women responded to the man attempting suicide and immediately tried to contact \nUAPS, but were directed to 911.  However, the response by Dispatch was sub-par, resulting in \na considerable amount of time being spent on the phone with Dispatch attempting to have \nofficers sent to CCIS, as the students did not know the address and the Officer on the phone \nwas not familiar with campus. This was reported to me as resulting in a roughly thirty minute \nwait time which resulted in three problems: 1) the responders could not focus on the man at risk, \n2) the responders were being exposed to a significantly traumatizing situation for longer than \nwarranted, and 3) despite one being suicide-prevention trained, the man was not receiving \noptimum care that a professional could provide. Could UAPS not be dispatched as a relief \nmeasure which then engages 911? \nImportantly, once the officers arrived, no line of dialogue was established between the students \nand officers or the University. After this, I worked to help one first-responder receive follow-up \ninformation for peace of mind as well as assistance from the University in providing services to \nassist her through the following weeks. I believe a system which establishes contact to first-\nresponders would allow follow-up and assistance of potentially traumatized responders. \nImportantly, I do not believe that the second responder was able to be identified or assisted. \nI have several crude potential venues which could be pursued in rectifying this, and know that \nother councillors of the GFC as well as UAPS are collaborating to investigate and discuss both \nflaws of the current system as well as how to address them.  \nResponse 10.1R from Associate Vice President (Risk Management Services) attached \nRisk Management Services \n1204 College Plaza \n8215-112 Street \nEdmonton, Alberta, Canada T6G 2C8 \nTel: 780.248.1147 \nFax: 780.492.2230 \nhttp://www.rms.ualberta.ca/\nOffice of Risk \nManagement Services \nTel: 780.248.1147 \nFax: 780.492.2230 \nEnvironment, \nHealth & Safety \nehs.info@ualberta.ca \nInsurance & Risk \nAssessment \nTel: 780.492.8886 \nFax: 780.492.2230 \nPolicy \nStandards \nTel: 780.492.0693 \nFax: 780.492.2230 \nProtective \nServices \nTel: 780.492.5050 \nFax: 780.492.0793 \nResource  \nPlanning \nTel: 780.492.5629 \nFax: 780.492.2230 \nAt the November 21st meeting of GFC you raised a question regarding the university’s response to a serious \nincident that occurred on October 20 and 21, 2016 at the CCIS building.  Your concern was about the university’s \n911 response protocol and the timeliness of the response.  Specifically, you asked, “Could the University of \nAlberta Protective Services (UAPS) not be dispatched as a relief measure which then engages 911?” \nLet me begin by providing the chronology of events of the above incident, as gathered from phone history and \nthe records of UAPS and Edmonton Police Service (EPS).  \nIncident Chronology \n On October 20, 2016 at 1833 hours UAPS received a call from a non-affiliated person advising UAPS that a\nperson in distress was on his way to the U of A campus. The caller was connected to 911, where they\nrepeated the information.  The caller advised UAPS and EPS that the person in distress may be heading for\nthe university’s North Campus. UAPS initiated a search\n At 1843 hours EPS was dispatched to the U of A’s North Campus\n At 1858 hours EPS joined the UAPS search\n At 1909 hours UAPS obtained a cell phone number for the person in distress from their educational\ninstitution; however, the number was out of service\n Sometime prior to 1952 hours, Student 1 saw Student 2 speaking to the person in distress, who was on a\nsixth floor ledge of CCIS.  Student 1, who had suicide prevention training, took over the conversation\n Student 1 instructed Student 2 to call UAPS.  Student 2 did not know how to contact UAPS and was given\ninstructions by Student 1\nDate: Monday, January 16, 2017 \nTo: Calvin Howard, Member, General Faculties Council \nFrom: Philip Stack, Associate Vice President (Risk Management Services) \nCc: Gitta Kulczycki, Vice President (Finance and Administration)\nRob Munro, Director, Environment, Health and Safety \nBill Spinks, Director, University of Alberta Protective Services \nRe: CCIS Incident  \nOctober 20 and 21, 2016 \nItem 10.1R\n Student 2 contacted UAPS at 780-492-5050 \n At 1952 hours Student 2’s call was transferred to the 911 operator \n At 1953 hours Student 2’s call was received by EPS.  EPS spoke with the students at some length during this \nperiod \n At 2002 hours EPS contacted UAPS, confirming the location of the person in distress \n At 2004 hours UAPS arrived on scene \n At 2011 hours EPS arrived on scene and took control of the incident \nWithin minutes of the initial call to UAPS and the connection with 911, UAPS had initiated a search. \nWithin 15 minutes of the initial call, EPS and UAPS were both engaged in the search. \nWithin 10 minutes of Student 2’s call, UAPS was on scene at CCIS. \nWithin 19 minutes of Student 2’s call, EPS was on scene at CCIS. \nUniversity’s 911 Protocol \n When a call is made to 911 and the caller identifies that they are calling from the University of Alberta, the \n911 operator contacts UAPS \n When the 911 service dispatches an emergency responder to the university, UAPS directs them to the \ncorrect building(s) on campus \nCommunications \nThe instructions to call 911 in an emergency (fire, police, ambulance) are posted on the entrance to all university \nbuildings, at elevator banks, on most land lines, on the U of A website, included in all new staff orientations, and \ncommunicated to every student via the Digest email shortly after the start of the fall term (see attached). \nResponse to Question \nIn response to Mr. Howard’s question, UAPS was immediately notified of the incident and received updated \ninformation from the 911 and/or EPS operators throughout.  UAPS and EPS were in ongoing communications \nthroughout the incident.  Although the students spent considerable time on the line with the EPS operator, \ninformation was being communicated to UAPS behind the scenes to ensure that the response was appropriate \nand as prompt as possible by both EPS and UAPS.  UAPS met with EPS to share the students’ concerns and to re-\naffirm with EPS the university’s 911 protocols.  Every effort is always made to gather the necessary information \nand share it with the responding agencies as quickly as possible.   \nOpportunities for Improvement \nIt is a challenge to educate the university community about the need to call 911 in an emergency (fire, police, \nambulance) and the need to provide specific location information to the operator.  The university will further \nenhance its communication efforts to improve awareness of its 911 protocols. \nStudent 1 identified a lack of information from the university following the incident.  The Emergency \nManagement Team will develop processes whereby information, as appropriate, is better communicated to the \nuniversity community during and following an incident.  \nAcknowledging the Two Students \nRisk Management Services would like to take this opportunity to, on behalf of the university, recognize and \nthank the two students who interceded on behalf of the student in distress.  It must have been an emotional \nand difficult experience.  Their compassion and willingness to act helped save the young man’s life.  \nWe also wish to thank you, Mr. Howard, for bringing these concerns forward.

The following two apparently contradictory statements are \nmade: \nA) The Comprehensive Institutional Plan discusses quotas based on race, gender, sex, or other \nclassifications unrelated to merit, and sets target proportions for staff belonging to those classes \nby 2025. \nB) One written hiring policy of this university is \"The University of Alberta hires on the basis of \nmerit\". \nIt is not clear to me how these two statements can both be true, so I direct the following 3-part \nquestion to the Human Resources and Provost's Offices: \n1) Is it this university's policy to hire academic staff solely on merit? \n2) In the university's stated goal (CIP pg. 15) to increase the proportion of its staff who belong to \ncertain groups based on race, gender, sex, or other non-merit based classifications, how heavily \nis merit weighted in hiring decisions compared to the weighting of non-merit based \nclassifications? \n3) What general strategies does this university advocate in attempting to fulfill its stated racial \nand sex quotas for its faculty that can help reconcile the target quotas with the assertion that \n\"The University of Alberta hires on the basis of merit\"? \nResponse 10.2R from Provost and Vice-President (Academic) attached \nQuestion for General Faculties Council: January 30, 2017 \nIn several meetings of GFC and APC, I have noticed some unclarity in the university's hiring goals and policies \nfor academic staff.  The following two apparently contradictory statements are made: \nA) The ​ Comprehensive Institutional Plan​  discusses quotas based on race, gender, sex, or other classifications\nunrelated to merit, and sets target proportions for staff belonging to those classes by 2025. \nB) One written hiring policy of this university is \"The University of Alberta hires on the basis of merit\".\nIt is not clear to me how these two statements can both be true, so I direct the following 3-part question to the \nHuman Resources and Provost's Offices: \n1) Is it this university's policy to hire academic staff ​ solely​  on merit?\n2) In the university's stated goal (CIP pg. 15) to increase the proportion of its staff who belong to certain groups\nbased on race, gender, sex, or other non-merit based classifications, how heavily is merit weighted in hiring \ndecisions compared to the weighting of non-merit based classifications? \n3) What general strategies does this university advocate in attempting to fulfill its stated racial and sex quotas\nfor its faculty that can help reconcile the target quotas with the assertion that \"The University of Alberta hires on \nthe basis of merit\"? \nResponse from the Office of the Provost and Vice-President (Academic) \nFor the Public Good ​ Objective 2: Create a faculty renewal program that builds on the strengths of \nexisting faculty and ensures the sustainable development of the University of Alberta’s talented, highly \nqualified, and diverse academy.  \nStrategy ii: “Review, improve and implement equity processes and procedures for recruiting and \nsupporting faculty to ensure a balanced academy, representative of women, visible minorities, \nsexual and gender minorities, Indigenous peoples, and people with disabilities.  \nFor the Public Good ​ Objective 3:  Support ongoing recruitment and retention of a highly skilled, diverse \ncommunity of non-academic and administrative staff by enriching the University of Alberta’s working \nenvironment.  \nStrategy ii: Review, improve, and implement equity processes and procedures for recruiting and \nsupporting staff to ensure that all categories of staff are representative of women, visible minorities, \nsexual and gender minorities, Indigenous peoples, and people with disabilities.  \nA critically important distinction to be made in our response to the question posed  is between the \nUniversity’s ​recruitment​ practices and the University’s ​hiring ​practices. \nCreating diversity in our faculty and staff starts with ensuring that the University can attract a diverse pool of \ncandidates for each opportunity. Our recruitment processes should be accessible, equitable and inclusive - \nreaching all demographics and under-represented groups alike. Our selection panels should be trained to \nrecognize and limit or eliminate bias, unconscious and conscious, in the entire candidate selection process. \nSelection panels are then tasked with hiring the most qualified candidate, based on merit (the skills and \nabilities to best perform the functions of the position), from that diverse and representative pool.  \nThe University is working, through equity education and awareness, to ensure that our recruitment \nprocesses encourage a diverse range of applicants and that individuals from under-represented groups are \npresented the opportunity to compete equitably for positions. Similarly, equity awareness needs to come to \nResponse 10.2R\nhttp://www.provost.ualberta.ca/en/~/media/provost/Documents/2016_UAlberta_CIP_FINAL.pdf\nthe hiring processes to ensure that they also proceed in a fair and unbiased way, and do not differentially \nadvantage or disadvantage any applicants.  \nIt is worth noting that making positive progress in this area is a lengthy process. Exploring what barriers are \nin place that may prevent individuals from under-represented groups from applying for positions for which \nthey are qualified is a complex process and must take into account that some of those barriers are likely \nbeing presented earlier than at the recruitment and hiring stages. In addition, hiring an individual for a \nposition for which that individual is not qualified (due to lack of experience or preparation) undermines that \nindividual and, if the individual is a member of an under-represented group, can implicitly reinforce biases \nregarding that under-represented group. \nGENERAL FACULTIES COUNCIL \nFor the Meeting of January 30, 2017 \nItem 10.3Q \nQuestion from GFC Member Brayden Whitlock (submitted by email January 20, 2017) \nQuestion 10.1Q \nMonths ago, a student group was charged an exorbitant security fee because of the \ncontroversial nature of one of their proposed events.  They could not pay the fee and thus had \nto cancel the event.  This fee was imposed by the Office of the Dean of Students.  I wrote a \npiece for the Edmonton Journal that summarizes my view on this matter, which can be \nfound here. Briefly, I think it amounts to a \"controversy tax\" that discourages controversial ideas \non campus.  This of course does not align with the university's stance on intellectual freedom \nand freedom of expression. \nWith the goal of having a policy that disallows this discrimination based on controversy, is there \ninterest from the Provost's Office in making policy changes so that the costs associated with \ncontroversial ideas are more fairly shared by the whole community? \n[Response from the Vice-Provost and Dean of Students will  be forwarded to GFC when \nprovided and will appear as Item 10.3R] \nhttp://edmontonjournal.com/opinion/columnists/brayden-whitlock-cherish-debate-at-university-of-alberta-dont-tax-it\nItem No. 11 \nGENERAL FACULTIES COUNCIL \nFor the Meeting of January 30, 2017 \nGeneral Faculties Council Standing Committee Report \nExecutive Committee  \n1.

General Faculties Council (GFC) is routinely called upon to arrange for the election of \nrepresentative(s) to populate approved search/review committee compositions in accordance to the policies \nand procedure within the Recruitment Policy (in UAPPOL). \nCampus interest and response to a nomination call may generate a pool of multiple nominees, thus requiring \nan election (held by GFC) to declare the successful candidate(s) to a membership role on the selection/review \ncommittee.

While some of \nour programs remain quite accessible, admission to other programs is highly competitive. Though the \nuniversity’s supply of seats in programs is relatively steady over time, demand for programs does fluctuate \nfrom year to year. Demand drivers include the economy, labour markets, and inter-institutional competition \nin provincial, national, and international applicant pools. In this environment, active management of \nenrolment is required to ensure that the university enrolls to its published targets. \nAs we work towards “build(ing) a diverse, inclusive community of exceptional students from Edmonton, \nAlberta, Canada, and the world1”, enrolment management plays a significant role in bringing those students \nto campus. The Office of the Registrar is committed to working with our partners in faculties and \nadministrative units to develop and implement strategies to support students throughout the enrolment \ncycle, from early inquiry as a prospective student to graduation and transition to alumni status.   \nWith the fourth Annual Report on Undergraduate Enrolment, we are pleased to highlight significant \nprogress. We have fundamentally changed our enrolment management processes, and we are succeeding. \nThe university’s undergraduate full-load-equivalent enrolments for 2016/17 are projected to land within one \npercent of institutional targets. As a result of the implementation of the Ten Point Plan on Undergraduate \nEnrolment Management, faculties now set and adjust admission averages throughout the enrolment cycle, \nin direct response to the size and qualifications of their applicants. As we now base admission and \nscholarship decisions on the early indicators of academic performance, students receive earlier offers. \nThese offers also have fewer conditions on them, reflecting a firmer commitment to the student. Admitted \nstudents are invited to formally commit to us by accepting their offers of admission. This provides critical \ninformation about how many seats remain open in a program as admission evaluations continue throughout \nthe cycle. The rate at which the university revokes admission offers began dropping significantly beginning \nin 2015/16, and it continues to fall. Multi-year trend data on admit rates, yield rates for admitted students, \nand mean competitive admission averages all reflect health and quality in the university’s applicant pools.  \nThe university continues to actively recruit Albertan students as our largest applicant group. Enticing high-\nachieving Albertan students to attend post-secondary education in their home province is an area of focus. \nOther priorities include Aboriginal students, rural students, Francophone students, high-achieving out-of-\nprovince students, and international students. Together, these groups form a diverse class of \nundergraduate students from a wide variety of backgrounds. We have seen important increases in the \nAboriginal applications, admissions, and enrolments, all positive signs for this high priority group. \nInternational enrolments remain stable and close to the university’s target of 15 percent, while also \nreflecting increased diversity in the international student body. \nIt is my hope that this year’s data will contribute to shared understanding and support evidence-based \ndecision making. While this report is a retrospective annual assessment, it also signals opportunity for \nfuture innovation. I look forward to what each year brings.   \nLisa Collins \nVice-Provost & University Registrar  \n1 University of Alberta Institutional Strategic Plan, For the Public Good \nAnnual Report on Undergraduate Enrolment 2016/17 2 \nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY \nThe Annual Report on Undergraduate Enrolment provides an overview of key undergraduate enrolment \nstatistics in each academic year (September 1 – August 31). Application, admission and enrolment statistics \nare collected as of December 1 each year. The 2016/17 report is the fourth such annual report issued by the \nOffice of the Registrar. The Report includes information about total enrolment, expressed in headcount, as \nwell as enrolment expressed by post-secondary institutions in the Province of Alberta as Full Load \nEquivalents (FLEs). In addition to tracking total enrolment, the report looks at three specific areas: \n1. Student intake: applications, admissions, and registrations, including selectivity and yield rates; \n2. Basic demographic data about the student body, and key populations within it; \n3. Student retention and completion. \nWhere appropriate, this report includes multi-year trend data, with data sources noted. \nTotal Undergraduate Enrolment \n Persons Percent   Persons Percent \nDomestic 26,551 86%  Full time 28,683 93% \nInternational 4,300 14%  Part time 2,168 7% \nTotal undergraduate enrolment 30,851   Total undergraduate enrolment  100% \nTotal enrolment increased by 225 persons over the previous year. The university is enrolled within one \npercent of its 2016/17 institutional target. Overall, FLE enrolment for 2016/17 is estimated at 26,257, or 99 \npercent of the institutional undergraduate target of 26,535. \nApplicants \n Persons Rate \nTotal applicants 31,977  \nAdmitted 18,929 Admission rate: 59% \nRegistered 12,709 Yield rate: 67% \nFor Fall 2016 enrolment, the university experienced growth resulting from a 2.1 percent increase in \napplications and 2 percent increase in admissions from the previous year. The 2016 yield rate of 67 percent \nis significant in that it represents the first time the university has seen an increase in yield in seven years. \nMean admission averages for undergraduate direct entry programs experienced improvement relative to \nthe past several academic years, reflecting an overall improvement in the quality of our applicant pool. \nAdmission offer revocation rates continued their downward trend and fell even further to 2 percent, \nconfirming that recent improvements to enrolment processes are beneficial to both the university and \nstudents.  \nInternational \nTop source countries, by last \nschool location \nChina: \n55% \nCanada: \n23% \nIndia: \n2% \nMalaysia: 1%, Brazil: 1%, Saudi Arabia: 1%, \nJapan: 1%, Nigeria: 1% \nTotal country citizenship in \ninternational headcount \n102 Three countries (China, India, Nigeria) each having 100 or more \nstudents within the population. \nAnnual Report on Undergraduate Enrolment 2016/17 3 \nThe 2016/17 international undergraduate ratio continues in its steady state of 14 percent, same as the \nprevious two years, which is close to the institutional target of 15 percent of total undergraduate enrolment. \nWhile China continues to remain the top citizenship country of our international students, the proportion of \nstudents with Chinese citizenship in total international enrolment decreased by 2 percent. This marks the \nfirst time in at least six years that the proportion of students with Chinese citizenship has decreased rather \nthan increased, this trend aligns with the institutional goal of increasing international diversity.  \nDomestic \nOrigin of undergraduates – based on \npermanent home address \n% of \nheadcount \nEdmonton & area 49%  \nRest of Alberta 25%  \nCanada (excluding Alberta) 9% Notably British Columbia, Saskatchewan and Ontario \nOutside of Canada 17%  \nDomestic student headcount represents 86 percent of our total undergraduate headcount, which is similar \nto the ratios for the two previous years. Although 86 percent of our students are domestic, only 84 percent \nof all students have permanent home address in Canada with the remainder 16 percent having permanent \naddresses outside of Canada. This suggests that some of our domestic students come from outside of \nCanada in much the same way as some international students come from within Canada.  \nAboriginal Enrolment \nTotal Aboriginal enrolment 1,012   \nTotal Aboriginal applicants 1,038 New Aboriginal applicants 744 \nTotal Aboriginal applicants admitted 664 Total new Aboriginal applicants admitted 447 \nMany gains were achieved in 2016/17 in the Aboriginal enrolment group. Undergraduate Aboriginal \nenrolment increased significantly, with a 9.6 percent increase in self-identified Aboriginal students. This \nyear also saw significant increases in Aboriginal application and admission, with a 16 percent and 18 \npercent increase, respectively, from the previous year. These numbers comprise new-to-university \napplicants as well as continuing students applying for program change. The number of new-to-university \nAboriginal applicants increased by 20 percent, representing the largest yearly increase in new Aboriginal \napplicants since 2011. 60 percent of new-to-university Aboriginal applicants were admitted. Overall (new \nplus program change) Aboriginal admission rate this year was 64 percent which is larger than the overall \nadmission rate (59 percent) among all applicants.   \nYear 1 to Year 2 Retention Rate  \nRetention Rate Returned to previous faculty Returned to a different faculty \nAboriginal  77.5% 68.8% 8.7% \nAll Domestic 88.6% 76.5% 12.1% \nInternational 86.7% 69.4% 17.3% \nOverall  88.3% 75.3% 13.0% \nAnnual Report on Undergraduate Enrolment 2016/17 4 \n1. TOTAL UNDERGRADUATE ENROLMENT  \n1.1 ENROLMENT HEADCOUNT \nSince 2012/13, undergraduate enrolment has declined annually by one to two percent to reach 30,626 \nstudents in 2015/16. The yearly decline was a result of deliberate efforts to manage enrolment down to \npublished targets as at least five faculties had been over enrolled. The total undergraduate headcount of \n30,626 for 2015/16 was associated with an average of 0.3 percent over enrolment across faculties. At the \nsame time, four faculties were moderately under enrolled, mainly because of a contraction in application \nvolume. In 2016/17 total headcount increased to 30,851, due partly to the correction of under enrolment in \ntwo of four faculties and partly, to a stronger application volume along with a moderate increase in yield \nrates, resulting in mild over enrolment in some faculties.   \nFigure 1: Enrolment Headcount (2011 to 2016)   \nSource: Office of the Registrar, December 1 REGSTATS Archive \nNote: Undergraduate headcount includes Postgraduate Medical and Dental Education \n7,474\t 7,598\t 7,664\t 7,572\t 7,204\t\n7,458\t\n31,300\t 31,904\t 31,648\t 31,161\t 30,626\t\n30,851\t\n-\n5,000\t\n10,000\t\n15,000\t\n20,000\t\n25,000\t\n30,000\t\n35,000\t\n2011/12 2012/13 2013/14 2014/15 2015/16 2016/17\nGraduate Undergraduate\nAnnual Report on Undergraduate Enrolment 2016/17 5 \n1.2 NEW AND CONTINUING REGISTRATION, UNDERGRADUATE HEADCOUNT  \nTotal undergraduate registration is comprised of “new to program” intake (applicants registered) and \ncontinuing students (continuing registered). In 2016/17, new to program headcount increased by 407 (3.3 \npercent). The number of students continuing in their previous year program increased by 195 (1.1 percent).  \nTable 1: 2016/2017 Applicant and Registration Numbers \nProgram Faculty  Applicants \nApplicants \nAdmitted \nApplicants \nRegistered \nContinuing \nRegistered \nTotal \nRegistered \nALES 1,298 882 590 977 1,552 \nArts 5,917 4,168 2,482 3,262 5,689 \nAugustana Faculty 1,225 710 380 634 1,008 \nBusiness 1,119 749 697 1,322 2,017 \nEducation 2,433 1,556 1,180 1,722 2,885 \nEngineering 4,543 2,710 1,783 2,440 4,236 \nLaw 1,133 226 217 346 563 \nMedicine and Dentistry 1,791 333 326 712 1,036 \nFaculty of Native Studies 190 135 103 79 178 \nNursing 1,863 600 458 886 1,342 \nOpen Studies 1,330 1,257 906 241 1,120 \nPharmacy & Pharm Science 426 156 153 390 543 \nPhysical Educ & Recreation 922 540 398 586 979 \nRehabilitation Medicine 21 21 20 1 21 \nFaculté Saint-Jean 388 284 223 352 575 \nScience 7,378 4,602 2,793 3,332 6,097 \n2016 Total 31,977 18,929 12,709 17,282 29,841 \n2015 Total  31,308 18,549 12,302 17,087 29,505 \nYear Over Year Change (#) 669 380 407 195 336 \nYear Over Year Change (%) 2.1% 2.0% 3.3% 1.1% 1.1% \nSource: Strategic Analysis and Data Warehousing, Applicant and Enrolment Management Report, Enrolment Management Table  \nNotes:  \n1. Does not include Postgraduate Medical and Dental Education, therefore 2016 total registered differ from data in Section 1.1. \n2. “Applicants Registered” and “Continuing Registered” do not always sum up to “Total Registered”. Students who are auditing \ncourses may be included in Applicants Registered but are excluded from Total Registered. Also, continuing students who had \nwithdrawn from all their classes over the past four terms but are registered in the current term would be counted in Total \nRegistered but neither in Applicant Registered nor Continuing Registered. \n3. Data shown for 2015 would differ from those shown in 2015 Annual Report as the current data no longer includes students in the \nCareer Preparation Diploma program of Faculté Saint-Jean. The University is now able to record the Career Preparation Program \nheadcounts distinctly from undergraduates.  \n4. Applicant and admission numbers shown here are based on the ‘applicant indicator’ method of sorting applicants into faculties. \nAlthough each applicant may have applied to (or been admitted in) more than one program, each applicant is placed only in their \nmain faculty (based on their revealed preference or registration). Therefore the number of applicants shown here for each program \nwould be less than the total number of applications received by the program. However, the aggregate number of applicants across \nall programs would balance out with the institutional total.   \n5. Numbers shown for Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences include BSc Pharmacy as well as the Doctor of Pharmacy program \nwhich is considered as an undergraduate program.  \nAnnual Report on Undergraduate Enrolment 2016/17 6 \n1.3 ENROLMENT FULL LOAD EQUIVALENT, UNDERGRADUATE \nFor 2016/17, the university had an overall undergraduate enrolment target of 26,535 Full Load Equivalents \n(FLEs). Total FLEs realized is estimated at 26,257 suggesting a near full enrolment at 99 percent of target. \nFaculty enrolments vary. Engineering has the largest under enrolment, estimated at 255 FLEs below target. \nAnother four faculties (Arts, Augustana, Business, Native Studies, and Science) have mild under enrolment \nranging from 4 to 132 FLEs below target. Enrolment in another nine faculties is either on target (Faculté \nSaint-Jean and Nursing) or mildly over target. A major improvement from 2015/16 to 2016/17 was the \nclosing of enrolment gaps for each of the faculties of Science and Native Studies. The Faculty of Science \nimproved to 61 FLEs (or 1.1 percent) under target having been 161 FLEs (or 2.9 percent) under in the \npreceding year. The Faculty of Native Studies improved to 4 FLEs or (3 percent) under target having been 16 \nFLEs under (or 12.5 percent) in the preceding academic year. However, the Faculty of Engineering remains \nunder enrolled as its actual student numbers have yet to increase to match its ongoing 780 FLEs ramp up in \nenrolment allocation. Therefore, there remains room to optimize enrolment within Engineering as well as \nother faculties with respect to institutional targets.  \nTable 2: 2016/2017 Enrolment by FLE and Comparison with Targets    \nProgram Faculty \n2016/17 \nFLE \nEstimate \n2016/17 \nFLE \nTarget \n2016/2017 Over/ \nUnder \nEnrolment FLE \n2015/2016 \nOver/ Under \nEnrolment FLE \n2016/17 \nOver / \nUnder  % \n2015/16 \nOver / \nUnder  % \nALES 1249 1227 22 6 1.8% 0.5% \nArts 4739 4871 -132 -68 -2.7% -1.4% \nAugustana Faculty 882 899 -17 4 -1.9% 0.5% \nBusiness 1754 1786 -32 1 -1.8% 0.1% \nEducation 2579 2551 28 -9 1.1% -0.3% \nEngineering 4085 4340 -255 -51 -5.9% -1.2% \nLaw 560 525 35 24 6.6% 4.6% \nMedicine and Dentistry 1066 1040 26 30 2.5% 2.9% \nFaculty of Native Studies 126 130 -4 -16 -3.0% -12.5% \nNursing 1356 1354 2 85 0.2% 6.1% \nOpen Studies 583 543 40 14     \nPhysical Educ & Recreation 838 800 38 21 4.7% 2.6% \nPharmacy & Pharm Science 497 467 30 13 6.5% 2.7% \nRehabilitation Medicine 2   2 3     \nFaculté Saint-Jean 515 514 1 3 0.3% 0.7% \nScience 5427 5488 -61 -161 -1.1% -2.9% \nTOTALS 26257 26535 -278 -101 -1.0% -0.38% \nAverage     -17 -6 0.5% 0.2% \nSource: Strategic Analysis and Data Warehousing, Applicant and Enrolment Management Report, Enrolment Management Table \nNotes: \n1.

However, 2016/17 saw a recovery from this decline as a total of 669 more applicants were \nrecorded in 2016/17 than in the preceding year. Total 2016/17 applicants are comparable to 2014/15 \nnumbers.  The growth in applicant numbers was almost entirely due to direct entry applicants while post-\nsecondary and internal transfer applications remained relatively stable (Sections 2.6 and 2.7).  \nFigure 4: Ten Year Undergraduate Applicant Curve  \nSource: Strategic Analysis and Data Warehousing, Applicant and Enrolment Management Report, Enrolment Management Table  \nNotes:   \n1.

This ratio is similar to 2015/16 and falls within \nhistorical admission rate of 57 to 63 percent. Admission rate is influenced by enrolment targets, quality of \nthe applicant pool, and yield rates. If applicant numbers continue to increase simultaneously as efforts are \nbeing made to attain higher yield rates and manage enrolment to targets, admission rate would have to \ndecrease so as to avoid over enrolment across programs.   \nFigure 5: Ten Year Undergraduate Admission Rate Curve \nSource: Strategic Analysis and Data Warehousing, Applicant and Enrolment Management Report, Enrolment Management Table  \nNote:  Data is based on December 1 archived data for each specified year.   \n59%\n57%\n59%\n63%\n63% 62%\n59% 57%\n59% 59%\n0%\n10%\n20%\n30%\n40%\n50%\n60%\n70%\n80%\n90%\n100%\n2007/08 2008/09 2009/10 2010/11 2011/12 2012/13 2013/14 2014/15 2015/16 2016/17\nAd\nm\niss\nio\nn\t\nRa\nte\nEnrolment\tCycle\nAnnual Report on Undergraduate Enrolment 2016/17 11 \n2.3 YIELD RATE \nYield rate is the proportion of admitted applicants who register. Yield rate had declined continuously from \n84 percent in 2009/10 to 66 percent in 2015/16. The long term decline was associated with the university \nbecoming more selective (targeting highly qualified applicants) which meant a shift towards a more \ncompetitive applicant category. Highly qualified applicants often have multiple admission offers from other \ninstitutions. Albertan applicants also have many institutional choices within the Campus Alberta system. \nReversing the long term decline in yield while maintaining a high quality of admits requires strategic \nmeasures to put the university a step ahead of top Canadian competitor institutions.  \nIn 2016/17 the university adopted an admission application deadline that was two months earlier than \nhistorical practice. This encouraged early applications and consequently allowed for a higher number of \nearly admissions. One immediate change was a small increase in yield rate from 66 percent in 2015/16 to 67 \npercent in 2016/17.  \nThere is certainly room to improve on our ability to yield high quality students, including continuing to \nimprove our understanding of the role of admission practices, the weight of various factors in the student \ndecision-making process, and the strategic use of financial supports.   \nFigure 6: Ten Year Undergraduate Yield Rate Curve \nSource: Strategic Analysis and Data Warehousing, Applicant and Enrolment Management Report, Enrolment Management Table  \nNote: Data is based on December 1 archived data for each specified year.   \n82%\n83%\n84%\n78%\n75%\n75%\n72%\n70%\n66% 67%\n0%\n10%\n20%\n30%\n40%\n50%\n60%\n70%\n80%\n90%\n2007/08 2008/09 2009/10 2010/11 2011/12 2012/13 2013/14 2014/15 2015/16 2016/17\nYi\nel\nd\t\nRa\nte\nEnrolment\tCycle\nAnnual Report on Undergraduate Enrolment 2016/17 12 \n2.4 COMPETITIVE ADMISSION AVERAGES, UNDERGRADUATE DIRECT ENTRY  \nAdmission offers into direct entry faculties are based on applicants meeting faculty-set competitive \naverages at the time of admission3. \nRelative to the preceding academic year, competitive admission averages increased in 2016/17 for four of \nthe institution’s ten direct entry faculties.

These three average categories are often positively associated with one another, so that an \nincrease in the competitive average in one category often indicates an increase in the competitive average in the other two categories. \nCompetitive Final Grade 12 admission average facilitates year-over-year comparison. \nAnnual Report on Undergraduate Enrolment 2016/17 13 \n2.5 MEAN ADMISSION AVERAGES, UNDERGRADUATE DIRECT ENTRY \nMean admission average refers to the mean of Final Grade 12 marks among all admitted direct entry \napplicants in required high school courses. It bears noting that this differs from “admission average,” as \nstudents may have been offered admission and scholarships based on earlier grade information. \nAmong the 10 direct entry faculties, 2016/17 presented the most improvement in admission averages over \nseveral past academic years. Mean 2016/17 averages among admitted applicants increased for six faculties \nrelative to the 2015/16 intake. The mean averages were steady for three other faculties but decreased for \none faculty. Also relative to 2014/15, mean admission averages increased in 2016/17 for three faculties, \nwere steady for six faculties and decreased for one faculty. Averages increased for seven faculties relative \nto 2013/14.  \nThe increments observed in mean admission averages indicate an overall improvement in the \ncompetitiveness of programs relative to the preceding years. The simultaneous improvement in mean \nadmission averages, competitive averages (Section 2.4) and yield rates (Section 2.3) was a very desirable \noutcome for 2016/17.   \nTable 4: Mean Averages among Admitted Applicants (2007 – 2016)  \nFaculty 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 Trend \nALES 79 79 80 81 81 81 83 85 84 83  \nArts 81 81 80 80 80 80 81 82 81 82  \nAugustana  79 79 79 79 79 79 79 80 79 80  \nEducation           79 82 80 80 81  \nEngineering 87 87 87 87 87 87 89 90 90 90  \nNative Studies 74 75 73 71 74 77 76 75 74 75  \nNursing 82 82 82 81 81 82 84 85 86 87  \nPER 80 80 80 81 82 83 83 84 83 84  \nFaculté Saint-Jean 80 81 79 80 80 79 80 79 81 81  \nScience 85 84 83 83 84 85 87 88 88 88  \nSource: Office of the Registrar  \nAnnual Report on Undergraduate Enrolment 2016/17 14 \n2.6 APPLICANT YIELD, UNDERGRADUATE DIRECT ENTRY \nDirect entry applicant numbers followed the long term increasing trend to reach 15,595 persons in 2016/17, \nrepresenting 659 and 486 persons over the applicant counts for 2015/16 and 2014/15 respectively.

Both admission and yield rates represented one percentage point increases over the \n2015/16 rates.    \nUnlike direct entry applicant volume which has exhibited a strong growth trend over the years (Section 2.6), \nthe post-secondary applicant curve has remained relatively flat. The steady number of post-secondary \napplicants suggests that almost all of the 669 person growth in overall applicant numbers (Section 2.1) was \ndue to high school applicants (Section 2.6)4.  \nFigure 8: Post-Secondary Transfer Applicant, Admission and Registration Numbers (2011 – 2016)   \nSource: Strategic Analysis and Data Warehousing, Applicant and Enrolment Management Report \nNote:  Data in the above chart does NOT include Internal Transfer applicants. \n4 High school applicants grew by 659 persons, post-secondary applicants grew by 45 persons and internal transfer applicants declined \nby 35 persons.

A recent UCAS5 study by \nAcademica (2016) indicates academic reputation, overall attractiveness of our campuses, as well as \ndistance from the applicant’s home are additional factors influencing an applicant’s choice of institution and \nprogram.  \nThe impact of admission timing on yield continues to be of interest. In 2016/17, domestic applicants who \nwere admitted in the early part of the cycle showed higher yield rates than those who were admitted at the \nlater part of the cycle. Admission timing did not have any significant impact on yield among international \napplicants. The university continues to place a high priority on extending early offers to eligible applicants in \nan effort to improve the applicant experience.  \nFigure 9: Yield Rate by Month of Admission among High School Applicants (2016/17 Admission Cycle)   \nSource: Office of the Registrar \n5 University of Alberta University/College Applicant Study, 2016, Academica Group \nAnnual Report on Undergraduate Enrolment 2016/17 17 \n2.9 ADMISSION AVERAGES AND YIELD RATE, UNDERGRADUATE DIRECT ENTRY  \nFor the Fall 2016 enrolment cycle, yield rates were higher among applicants with lower admission averages \nthan among those with higher averages. This negative correlation between applicant admission averages \nand yield was much like what was observed in the preceding enrolment cycle. Also similar to the preceding \ncycle, Fall 2016 admission averages had a stronger negative effect on yield than admission timing.  \nFigure 10: Yield Rate by Admission Average Band among High School Applicants (2015/16 Admission Cycle)   \nSource: Office of the Registrar  \nAnnual Report on Undergraduate Enrolment 2016/17 18 \n2.10   ADMISSION REVOCATION RATES, UNDERGRADUATE DIRECT ENTRY \nUp to and including 2014/15, applicants were offered early conditional admission but were also required to \nmaintain a competitive average in order to retain the offer. Students who did not meet the requirements had \ntheir offers revoked. As a result, offer revocation rates had routinely been as high as 15 percent in some \nfaculties. Students with revoked offers previously reported distress about having their offers revoked, \nparticularly when those revocations occurred late in the enrolment cycle, after they had made plans to \nattend.   \nBeginning from 2015/16, all faculties except Engineering made a policy change that allowed extension of \nfirm offers of admission by meeting a competitive average based on Grade 11 marks, a combination of \nGrade 11 and Grade 12, or Final Grade 12 marks. Therefore, overall direct entry revocation rate fell \ndramatically to three percent in 2015/16, resulting in increased predictability for students. In 2016/17, \noverall direct entry revocation rate fell even further to 2 percent. Revocation rates vary by faculty - 2016/17 \nrevocation rates ranged from 0.7 percent for Augustana to 6.1 percent for the Faculty of Engineering. \nFigure 11: Direct Entry Admission Revocation Rates (2014 – 2016)   \nSource: Office of the Registrar \n9%\n3%\n2%\n0%\n2%\n4%\n6%\n8%\n10%\n2014/15 2015/16 2016/17\nAdmission\tRevocation\tRate\nAugustana\nScience\nArts\nALES\nNursing\nPhys.\tEd\t&\tRecreation.\nNative\tStudies\nEducation\nFaculté\tSaint\tJean\nEngineering\n0.7%\n1.0%\n1.1%\n1.1%\n1.5%\n1.7%\n2.0%\n2.1%\n4.2%\n6.1%\n2016\tRevocation\tRate\tby\tFaculty\t\nAnnual Report on Undergraduate Enrolment 2016/17 19 \n3.

This shift is in line \nwith the institutional goal of increasing international diversity.  \nThe decrease in the proportion of Chinese citizens can be attributed primarily to small increases in the \nproportions of citizens from India, Nigeria, Malaysia and Bangladesh.  \nAnother clear trend in citizenship distribution among our international students is the progressive decrease \nin the proportion of students from the Republic of Korea, falling from 5 percent in 2011/12 down to 2 \npercent in 2016/17.  \nFigure 13: Distribution of International Students by Country of Citizenship (2011 to 2016) \nSource: Office of the Registrar, December 1 REGSTATS Archive \n*Other consists of the remainder 187 international countries with each contributing one percent or less to the international student \ncounts in any specified year.  \n0%\n20%\n40%\n60%\n80%\n100%\n2011/12 2012/13 2013/14 2014/15 2015/16 2016/17\n60% 64% 68% 68%\n73% 71%\n5% 4%\n3% 3% 2% 2%3%\n3%\n23% 20% 17% 17% 16% 17%\nAcademic\tYear\nOther*\nBrazil\nJapan\nNigeria\nMalaysia\nHong\tKong\nIndia\nKorea\nChina\nAnnual Report on Undergraduate Enrolment 2016/17 21 \n3.3 TOP SOURCE COUNTRIES BY LAST SCHOOL LOCATION, UNDERGRADUATE \nFor some students, country of citizenship differs from country of last school.

Similar to the change observed for \ncountry of citizenship, the proportion with last school in China is down 2 percent from 2015/16.   \n23 percent of our 2016/17 international students came from high schools or other post-secondary \ninstitutions in Canada, 2 percent come from India, while roughly 1 percent come from schools in each of \nMalaysia, Brazil, Saudi Arabia, Japan and Nigeria.  \nSimilar to the trend observed for citizenship (Section 3.2), both the number and proportion of international \nstudent enrolling from schools in the Republic of Korea have declined progressively over the last five years, \nfrom 54 students (or 1.8 percent) in 2011/12 to 21 students (or 0.5 percent) in 2016/17.

This decline did not occur in 2016/17 as a total of 102 \ncountries are represented in the university’s 2016/17 international undergraduate enrolment. A total of 47 \ncountries have at least 5 students within the international undergraduate population while 16 countries \nhave at least 20 students. There are 3 countries (China, India and Nigeria) with 100 or more students within \nthe international undergraduate headcount for 2016/17. These statistics are specific to international \nstudents alone. They do not capture domestic students or dual citizenship both of which would increase the \nnumber of countries represented in our overall undergraduate population.  \nFigure 15: Number of Country Citizenship in International Student Headcount (2011 to 2016)  \nSource: Office of the Registrar, December 1 REGSTATS Archive \n2 2 3 4 1 3\n14 15 16 17 17 16\n38 42 41\n46 47 47\n109 109 111 108\n102 102\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\n120\n2011/12 2012/13 2013/14 2014/15 2015/16 2016/17\nN\num\nbe\nr\to\nf\tC\nou\nnt\nrie\ns\nAcademic\tYear\nHeadcount\t>\t100 Headcount\t>\t20 Headcount\t>\t5 Headcount\t>\t0\nAnnual Report on Undergraduate Enrolment 2016/17 23 \n4. DOMESTIC UNDERGRADUATE ENROLMENT  \n4.1 DOMESTIC HEADCOUNTS AND RATIOS, UNDERGRADUATE \nAs with international headcount the number of domestic undergraduates decreased mildly between 2014/15 \nand 2015/16 due to a decline in applicant numbers (Section 2.1). With the recovery of applicant numbers to \n2014/15 level, domestic enrolment in 2016/17 has also recovered and is closer to 2014/15 enrolment \nnumbers. The simultaneous growth in both domestic and international headcount means that the \nproportional mix of students by national status has not changed. The ratio of domestic headcount in total \nundergraduate enrolment remains steady at 86 percent.  \nFigure 16: Domestic Enrolment Headcounts and Proportions in Total Enrolment (2011 to 2016)\t\t\t\nSource: Office of the Registrar, December 1 REGSTATS Archive \nNotes: \n1.

Based on the number of self-identified students, total Aboriginal enrolment increased by 89 \nheadcount from the preceding academic year, reaching 1,012 students in 2016/17. The percent of Aboriginal \nenrolment in total headcount also increased from 3.01 percent to 3.28 percent. With respect to domestic \nstudents only, Aboriginal headcount constitutes 3.8 percent.  \nFrom the University Calendar, “The university recognizes that Aboriginal applicants have traditionally been \nunder represented in higher education and strives towards having the university’s Aboriginal student \npopulation attain a level that is at least proportionate to the Aboriginal population of the province.” 7 \nStatistics Canada National Household Survey of 2011 indicated that Aboriginal people comprise 6.2 percent \nof Alberta’s population. Our Institutional Strategic Plan, For the Public Good, echoes this commitment to \nengage Indigenous students and nations, with a specific strategy8 dedicated to developing and implementing \nan undergraduate recruitment and retention strategy to attract Indigenous students from across Alberta \nand Canada. \nFigure 19: Aboriginal Enrolment Headcounts and Proportions in Total Enrolment (2011 to 2016)\t\t\t\nSource: Office of the Registrar, December 1 REGSTATS Archive \nNote: Includes Postgraduate Medical and Dental Education.  \n7 2016 – 17 University Calendar > uab.ca/calendar > Undergraduate Admission >General Admission Requirements > Admission of \nAboriginal Applicants  \n8 University of Alberta Institutional Strategic Plan For the Public Good> Build > Objective 1 > Strategy 2 \n868 916 898 918 923\n1012\n0\n200\n400\n600\n800\n1000\n1200\n2011/12 2012/13 2013/14 2014/15 2015/16 2016/17\nHe\nad\nco\nun\nt\nAcademic\tYear\n2.77% 2.87% 2.84%\n2.95% 3.01%\n3.28%\nAnnual Report on Undergraduate Enrolment 2016/17 27 \n4.5 ABORIGINAL APPLICATION AND REGISTRATION TRENDS, UNDERGRADUATE \n2016/17 saw a rise in the number of Aboriginal applicants.

RETENTION AND COMPLETION RATES  \n5.1 STUDENT RETENTION, YEAR 1 TO YEAR 2, UNDERGRADUATE \nRetention rate among Year 1 to Year 2 undergraduates is the proportion of first-year undergraduate \nstudents who continue to their second year of study, either returning to the same faculty as their first year \nor transferring to a different faculty. The proportion of our first-year undergraduates who return to same \nfaculty has grown steadily over the past eight years from 67.9 percent in 2008/09 to 73.9 percent in 2015/16.  \nIn the 2016/17, 75.3 percent of those who started their studies in the university in 2015/16 returned to their \nfirst-year faculty to continue in their program.  \nSimultaneously, the rate of transfer to a different faculty after the first year of study followed an overall \ndownward trend from 14.5 percent in 2011/12 to13 percent in 2014/15 and has remained steady at 13 \npercent in 2016/17. In other words, 13 percent of those who started their studies in the university in 2015/16 \nreturned to continue in a different program in 2016/17. \nThe overall retention rate comprised of those who returned to their previous faculty and those who \ntransferred to a different faculty. The overall first-year undergraduate retention rate has increased \ngradually during over the years, from 82.2 percent in 2008/09 to 86.9 percent in 2015/16. In 2016/17 this \nlong term increasing trend was sustained with retention reaching a ten year high of 88.3 percent.   \nThe continuous growth in first-year undergraduate retention rate indicates a steady decrease in the \nproportion of students who drop out or transfer to other universities. In 2016/17, about a third of the \nstudents withdrawing from the university were required to withdraw, the others dropped out (or transferred \nout) voluntarily.  \nFigure 22: Proportions of First-Year Undergraduates who Returned for their Second Year of Study (2007 to 2016)   \nSource: Strategic Analysis and Data Warehousing, Applicant and Enrolment Management Report, Retention Rates Table  \n70.4% 67.9% 70.1% 70.0% 70.5% 70.3% 72.2%\n73.2% 73.9% 75.3%\n13.4% 14.3% 14.0% 14.4% 14.5% 14.4% 12.7% 13.0% 13.0% 13.0%\n83.8% 82.2% 84.1% 84.4% 85.0% 84.7% 84.9% 86.2%\n86.9% 88.3%\n0.0%\n10.0%\n20.0%\n30.0%\n40.0%\n50.0%\n60.0%\n70.0%\n80.0%\n90.0%\n100.0%\n2007/08 2008/09 2009/10 2010/11 2011/12 2012/13 2013/14 2014/15 2015/16 2016/17\nRe\ntu\nrn\ned\nReport\tYear\nReturned\tto\tSame\tFaculty Returned\tto\ta\tDifferent\tFaculty\t Total\tRetention\tRate\nAnnual Report on Undergraduate Enrolment 2016/17 29 \n5.2 STUDENT RETENTION, YEAR 1 TO YEAR 2, DOMESTIC UNDERGRADUATE   \nThe trend in the first-year retention rate among domestic undergraduate students is much similar to that of \nthe overall first-year population as shown in Section 5.1. The total first-year retention rate among domestic \nstudents grew at a moderate yearly rate between 2008/09 and 2013/14, but has exhibited a much stronger \ngrowth since 2013/14, reaching a ten year high of 88.6 percent in 2016/17.  \nAmong the domestic first-year students returning to the university, an increasingly higher proportion have \nreturned in each year to their first-year faculty since 2011/12. In 2016/17, 76.5 percent of those who were \nregistered for the first time in 2015/16 returned to continue in their first-year faculty, only 12.1 percent \nreturned to a different faculty.  \nFigure 23: Proportions of First-Year Domestic Undergraduates who Returned for their Second Year of Study (2007 to 2016)   \nSource: Strategic Analysis and Data Warehousing, Applicant and Enrolment Management Report, Retention Rates Table \n71.2% 69.4% 71.3% 70.3% 71.1% 71.2% 72.8%\n74.2% 75.3% 76.5%\n12.8% 13.7% 13.3% 14.3% 13.8% 13.4% 11.7% 12.2% 12.3% 12.1%\n84.0% 83.1% 84.6% 84.6% 84.9% 84.6% 84.5% 86.4%\n87.6% 88.6%\n0.0%\n10.0%\n20.0%\n30.0%\n40.0%\n50.0%\n60.0%\n70.0%\n80.0%\n90.0%\n100.0%\n2007/08 2008/09 2009/10 2010/11 2011/12 2012/13 2013/14 2014/15 2015/16 2016/17\nRe\ntu\nrn\ned\nReport\tYear\nReturned\tto\tSame\tFaculty\t Returned\tto\ta\tDifferent\tFaculty\t Total\tRetention\tRate\nAnnual Report on Undergraduate Enrolment 2016/17 30 \n5.3 STUDENT RETENTION, YEAR 1 TO YEAR 2, INTERNATIONAL UNDERGRADUATE \nUnlike domestic first-year undergraduates as discussed in Section 5.2, retention rate among international \nfirst-year undergraduates has not followed as consistent a growth path over the past 10 years. Overall \ninternational first-year retention rate had grown steadily from 72.5 percent to 86.1 percent between 2008/09 \nand 2011/12 but have mostly showed year over year declines since 2011/12, reaching 84.1 percent in \n2015/16. The declining trend seems to have reversed in the current academic year with first-year \ninternational undergraduate retention observed at 86.7 percent in 2016/17, indicating a solid gain over \n2015/16. \nThe overall 2016/17 first-year retention rate among international students comprised of 69.4 percent \nreturning to their previous faculty and 17.3 percent returning to a different faculty.  \nFigure 24: Proportions of First-Year International Undergraduates who Returned for their Second Year of Study (2007 to 2016)   \nSource: Strategic Analysis and Data Warehousing, Applicant and Enrolment Management Report, Retention Rates Table\t\n59.1%\n52.6% 56.4%\n67.8% 65.5% 64.3%\n68.7% 68.3% 68.2% 69.4%\n22.8% 19.9% 21.1%\n15.3%\n20.6% 21.0% 18.6% 16.9% 15.9% 17.3%\n81.9%\n72.5%\n77.5%\n83.1% 86.1% 85.3% 87.3% 85.2% 84.1%\n86.7%\n0.0%\n10.0%\n20.0%\n30.0%\n40.0%\n50.0%\n60.0%\n70.0%\n80.0%\n90.0%\n100.0%\n2007/08 2008/09 2009/10 2010/11 2011/12 2012/13 2013/14 2014/15 2015/16 2016/17\nRe\ntu\nrn\ned\nReport\tYear\nReturned\tSame\tFaculty Returned\tDifferent\tFaculty\t Total\tRetention\tRate\nAnnual Report on Undergraduate Enrolment 2016/17 31 \n5.4 STUDENT RETENTION, YEAR 1 TO YEAR 2, ABORIGINAL UNDERGRADUATE  \nData on Aboriginal students is based on self-identification.

Our 7,300 graduate students work in over 300 research areas with 250 official \nspecializations. Recruitment, admission and enrolment are highly decentralized, and the \ngraduate student body is rich in diversity. One third of our graduate students are international, \ncompared to 14% of our undergraduate population. Half self-identify as members of a visible \nminority group (Black, East Asian, South Asian, Southeast Asian, West Asian, Latin American or \nMixed Origin), according to the 2016 Canadian Graduate and Professional Student Survey, and \nan additional 3.7% self-identify as Aboriginal.1 Just over half of our graduate students are \nmarried (41.4% of respondents) or living with a domestic partner (11.2%). One quarter of \nUniversity of Alberta graduate students (25.8%) have at least one child. The age distribution is \nalso worth noting: \n21-25 19.3% \n26-30 35.5% \n31-35 21.6% \n36-40 9.0% \n41-45 6.1% \n45 + 8.5% \nThere is clearly no such thing as a “typical graduate student.” \nGeneralizing across such a demographically and academically differentiated landscape is risky \n– and yet the data here reaffirm the quality of our students (who consistently show high \nadmission GPAs) and the strength of our supervision (time to completion is stable, and the \nattrition rate is low by comparison with our peers, and improving).  \nWe are seeing three distinct enrolment trends at play. After reaching a historic high of over \n3,000 in 2012, doctoral enrolments are decreasing. We still have more PhD students than we \nhad in 2007, before the numbers began to climb, but we are approaching that level again. \nThesis-based Master’s enrolments are more or less stable, with last year’s low appearing \nanomalous. The real story here is course-based Master’s, which continue to surge. The \nUniversity of Alberta now has nearly 50% more course-based Master’s students than we had a \ndecade ago. Of particular note, these programs are favoured by international students (who \ncontinue to complete their degrees more quickly than domestic students) and by women, who \nnow outmatch men by a factor of nearly 2:1 in course-based streams. Women are also edging \ncloser to 50% of doctoral enrolments, and maintaining parity with men in thesis-based Master’s \nprograms.  \nThere are some significant changes to this year’s report. First, 2016 is a year of restatement. In \nlast year’s graduate enrolment report we relied on both FGSR statistics and those from the \nOffice of Strategic Analysis data warehouse. In order to ensure that this report is sustainable in \nthe future, we have made the decision to rely solely on data from the Office of Strategic \nAnalysis. In some cases, these figures differ from those that were held in the FGSR Statistics \ndatabase we used for more historical comparisons last year. This decision has resulted in some \ndifferences between the 2015-16 and 2016-17 reports, particularly in reporting time to \n1 The Canadian Graduate and Professional Student Survey is a triennial, nation-wide survey. The 2016 \nresponse rate for the University of Alberta was 25.0%. Of respondents, 59.2% were female and 40.8% \nwere male; 61.1% were Canadian, 8.5% Permanent Residents, and 30.4% indicated international status.  \n4 \ncompletion and rate of completion. We are confident that restating these figures now will ensure \naccurate long-term comparisons in years to come.  \nThe second change in this report is the inclusion of new data. In response to requests from \nreaders of last year’s report, we have provided undergraduate to graduate student ratios and \ngraduate student to professor ratios broken down by Faculty. Most importantly, we have \nincluded some U15 comparator data. As readers may be aware these data come from a data \nsharing agreement and, while there is significant effort made by consortium members to ensure \nthat the information provided is complete and comparable, we do not control the sources of this \ninformation. Finding up to date, inclusive and reliable comparator data in the graduate area \nremains a challenge. Readers may be interested to know that the Council of Graduate Schools, \nthe US-based organization, will be launching a Canadian enrolment data reporting project in \nJanuary 2017. \nBy way of a minor note, in addition to students in doctoral and master’s students, we do have a \nsmall number of students in other categories. These include qualifying, visiting and probationary \nstudents as well as people registered in post baccalaureate certificates or postgraduate \ndiplomas. The total number of such students is small and thus we have only specifically \nreported on them in the categories where it makes sense to do so. Similarly, a small number of \nstudents (73 total for the past 10 years, 23 in the period from 2012 to 2016) have the Faculty of \nGraduate Studies and Research listed as their home department. These individuals are \nincluded in total numbers of graduate students, but are not reported in Faculty-by-Faculty \nanalyses. \nFGSR welcomes the opportunity to be a key partner in strategic enrolment management and \npresents this report with great pride in our students, our supervisors and our programs. I \nappreciate the contributions of Cristiana Caramihai, Amy Dambrowitz, Gurpinder Gandhara, \nDenise Giles and Deborah Williams. I accept responsibility for any shortcomings. \nHeather Zwicker, PhD \nInterim Vice-Provost and Dean, Faculty of Graduate Studies and Research \n6 January 2017 \n5 \nIn this section, all numbers are the standard December 1st headcounts, as reported to Statistics \nCanada and the Government of Alberta. It is worth noting that this enrolment figure is a point-in-\ntime snapshot, and does not show the total number of graduate students who have been on \ncampus at various points during the year. December 1st headcounts are a snapshot of the Fall \nTerm registrations only.  \nVariation in graduate enrolment from one academic year to the next is due to three independent \nfactors. The number increases by the total number of new registrations, and it decreases by \nthe number of those leaving, through convocation or through attrition (see section 3). As an \naggregate measure, enrolment variations have to be understood with reference to the changes \nin these three factors. \nThis graph demonstrates the overall trends in graduate enrolment over the last decade. Course-\nbased Master’s programs show a consistent rise in enrolment levels, while we are beginning to \nsee a decrease in thesis-based programs.  \n0\n500\n1000\n1500\n2000\n2500\n3000\nH\ne\na\nd\nc\no\nu\nn\nt \nFall Term \nPhD\nThesis - based Master's\nCourse - based Master's\nOther\n6 \nSource: Strategic Analysis and Data Warehousing – accessed December 3, 2016  \nNotes: (1) Figures represent the Fall term enrolment headcount; (2) Students who have FGSR listed as their \ndepartment are included.  \nFaculty Fall 2012 Fall 2013 Fall 2014 Fall 2015 Fall 2016 \nALES 246 235 237 230 221 \nArts 472 478 452 413 412 \nBusiness 60 61 51 45 46 \nEducation 296 291 295 257 246 \nEngineering 717 702 711 678 679 \nExtension - - - - - \nFaculté Saint-Jean - - - - - \nFaculty of Native Studies - - - - - \nLaw 8 8 7 7 8 \nMedicine and Dentistry 319 316 340 342 329 \nNursing 71 65 68 64 68 \nPharmacy 34 33 32 32 28 \nPhysical Educ. & Recreation 60 65 55 56 49 \nPublic Health 41 42 45 50 47 \nRehabilitation Medicine 36 38 36 37 35 \nScience 709 686 646 566 564 \nTotal 3,069 3,020 2,975 2,777 2,732 \nSource: Strategic Analysis and Data Warehousing – accessed December 3, 2016  \n2574 2585 \n2794 \n2907 2952 \n3069 3020 2975 \n2777 2732 \n1986 \n2044 \n2128 2183 \n2200 \n2207 \n2217 2128 \n1966 \n2051 \n1728 \n1990 \n2124 2167 \n2242 \n2197 \n2272 2329 2325 2498 \n1500\n1700\n1900\n2100\n2300\n2500\n2700\n2900\n3100\n3300\nH\ne\na\nd\nc\no\nu\nn\nt \nFall Term \nPhD\nThesis - based Master's\nCourse - based Master's\n7 \nThis table shows a consistent growth in course-based Master’s programs, probably as a result \nof interest in professional Master’s degrees.  \nFall 2012 Fall 2013 Fall 2014 Fall 2015 Fall 2016 \nFaculty M-C M-T Total M-C M-T Total M-C M-T Total M-C M-T Total M-C M-T Total \nALES 13 249 262 26 258 284 21 261 282 22 244 266 35 255 290 \nArts 104 313 417 97 311 408 90 269 359 81 240 321 87 255 342 \nBusiness 448 - 448 499 - 499 543 1 544 558 - 558 556 - 556 \nEducation 497 97 594 496 85 581 546 80 626 567 70 637 576 70 646 \nEngineering 188 496 684 148 566 714 93 545 638 36 527 563 111 544 655 \nExtension 57 2 59 49 2 51 54 1 55 54 - 54 52 8 60 \nFaculté Saint-\nJean 30 20 50 24 16 40 16 13 29 20 8 28 13 5 18 \nFaculty of \nNative Studies - 7 7 - 10 10 - 7 7 - 12 12 - 20 20 \nLaw 1 8 9 2 6 8 - 4 4 - 5 5 1 5 6 \nMedicine and \nDentistry 2 277 279 2 265 267 - 281 281 2 260 262 4 277 281 \nNursing 32 43 75 43 33 76 47 29 76 45 20 65 36 18 54 \nPharmacy - 21 21 - 13 13 - 17 17 - 18 18 - 22 22 \nPhysical Educ. \n& Recreation 15 64 79 16 57 73 18 49 67 18 44 62 15 41 56 \nPublic Health 134 95 229 146 99 245 144 100 244 131 80 211 120 71 191 \nRehabilitation \nMedicine 589 37 626 633 41 674 667 39 706 680 48 728 779 49 828 \nScience 87 478 565 91 455 546 90 432 522 111 390 501 113 411 524 \nTotal 2197 2207 4404 2272 2217 4489 2329 2128 4457 2325 1966 4291 2498 2051 4549 \nM-T = Thesis-Based Master’s, M-C = Course-Based Master’s  \nSource: Strategic Analysis and Data Warehousing – accessed December 3, 2016  \nNotes: (1) Figures represent the Fall term enrolment headcount of Master`s students by Faculty; (2) Students who \nhave FGSR as their department are excluded. \n8 \nFaculty Fall 2012 Fall 2013 Fall 2014 Fall 2015 Fall 2016 \nALES 8 5 8 4 4 \nArts 13 14 23 17 16 \nBusiness 8 21 19 10 16 \nEducation 6 1 4 7 4 \nEngineering 7 12 9 9 9 \nExtension 3 1 - 1 - \nFaculté Saint-Jean 1 6 1 3 9 \nFaculty of Native Studies 1 - 1 - - \nLaw - - - - - \nMedicine and Dentistry 4 3 7 7 8 \nNursing 7 5 4 2 2 \nPharmacy - 2 - - 1 \nPhysical Educ. & Recreation - 1 3 3 1 \nPublic Health 2 4 4 1 3 \nRehabilitation Medicine 32 75 45 68 100 \nScience 10 5 12 4 4 \nTotal 102 155 140 136 177 \nSource: Strategic Analysis and Data Warehousing – accessed December 3, 2016  \nNotes: (1) Figures represent the Fall term enrolment headcount in other programs by Faculty; (2) Other programs \ninclude: post-Baccalaureate and post Master’s Certificates, postgraduate diplomas, qualifying, special, visiting and \nprobationary students (by Faculty).  \n9 \nThis table gives an overview of the ratio of graduate students to professors in each Faculty. The \ngoal is to express a supervisory ratio: thus all assistant, associate and full-time professors \n(those in academic category A.1.1) are included in the faculty number, and students include all \ntypes of programs (PhD, Master’s and Other).  \nWe have reported on every faculty in this dataset, although there are important nuances that \ncome to light in the following tables: Faculties with large course-based Master’s programs \n(Business’s MBA, most graduate programs in the Faculty of Rehabilitation Medicine, a \nsubstantial proportion of Engineering’s graduate offerings, e.g.) will appear to be carrying a \ndisproportionately heavy supervisory responsibility. The value of this table is principally in \ntracking whether student numbers and faculty complement are moving in tandem. Tables 1.3.2, \n1.3.3 and 1.3.4 offer breakdowns by degree. \nOn balance the graduate student to faculty ratio has stayed constant over the last five years, \nwith the exception of Fall 2014, when the professoriate shrunk (probably a function of budget \ncuts in previous years). \nFall 2012 Fall 2013 Fall 2014 Fall 2015 Fall 2016 \nFaculty Prof Grad Ratio Prof Grad Ratio Prof Grad Ratio Prof Grad Ratio Prof Grad Ratio \nALES 101 516 1:5.1 104 524 1:5.0 108 527 1:4.9 111 500 1:4.5 113 515 1:4.6 \nArts 353 902 1:2.6 347 900 1:2.6 319 834 1:2.6 322 751 1:2.3 323 770 1:2.4 \nBusiness 77 516 1:6.7 73 581 1:8.0 74 614 1:8.3 72 613 1:8.5 71 618 1:8.7 \nEducation 115 896 1:7.8 109 873 1:8.0 100 925 1:9.3 104 901 1:8.7 107 896 1:8.4 \nEngineering 184 1408 1:7.7 200 1428 1:7.1 194 1358 1:7.0 201 1250 1:6.2 204 1343 1:6.6 \nExtension 17 62 1:3.6 17 52 1:3.1 16 55 1:3.4 17 55 1:3.2 15 60 1:4.0 \nFaculté Saint-\nJean 33 51 1:1.5 30 46 1:1.5 25 30 1:1.2 29 31 1:1.1 30 27 1.1:1 \nFaculty of \nNative \nStudies 9 8 1.1:1 8 10 1:1.3 8 8 1:1.0 10 12 1:1.2 11 20 1:1.8 \nLaw 32 17 1.9:1 32 16 2:1.0 29 11 2.6:1 27 12 2.3:1 28 14 2:1.0 \nMedicine and \nDentistry 211 602 1:2.9 214 586 1:2.7 213 628 1:2.9 217 611 1:2.8 212 618 1:2.9 \nNursing 52 153 1:2.9 51 146 1:2.9 49 148 1:3.0 47 131 1:2.8 47 124 1:2.6 \nPharmacy 23 55 1:2.4 20 48 1:2.4 20 49 1:2.5 22 50 1:2.3 24 51 1:2.1 \nPhysical \nEduc. & \nRecreation 40 139 1:3.5 43 139 1:3.2 39 125 1:3.2 38 121 1:3.2 41 106 1:2.6 \nPublic Health 27 272 1:10.1 28 291 1:10.4 25 293 1:11.7 26 262 1:10.1 27 241 1:8.9 \nRehabilitation \nMedicine 42 694 1:16.5 48 787 1:16.4 42 787 1:18.7 44 833 1:18.9 44 963 1:21.9 \nScience 290 1284 1:4.4 300 1237 1:4.1 288 1180 1:4.1 286 1071 1:3.7 288 1092 1:3.8 \nTotal 1606 7575 1:4.7 1624 7664 1:4.7 1549 7572 1:4.9 1573 7204 1:4.6 1585 7458 1:4.7 \nSource: Strategic Analysis and Data Warehousing – accessed December 3, 2016. \nNotes: (1) Figures represent the professor headcount by faculty (Prof) compared with Fall term enrolment headcount \nof graduate students by faculty (Grad); (2) Contingent faculty, administrative faculty, and faculty on long-term \ndisability (LTD) are not captured; (3) Student numbers include all types of programs (PhD, Master’s and Other); (4) \nStudents who have FGSR as their department are excluded. \n10 \nThe ratio of doctoral students to faculty over this time period is relatively stable, indicating that \nthe decrease in the number of doctoral candidates has moved in parallel with the number of \nfaculty members.

Expanding the pool of \nqualified applicants is a component of active recruitment strategies. \nThe yield rate (the percentage of registrations resulting from offers of admission) has been \nextremely steady, at about two thirds. Increasing the yield rate is another component of active \nrecruitment strategies. \nIn the Applications and Admissions tables, the effect of not including non-Fall registrations can \nbe seen. Therefore we have provided a table stating the average Fall percentage of \napplications, admissions and registrations as compared to the year as a whole. \nThere is gender imbalance in the number of applications for different degrees, with doctoral \nprograms attracting almost twice as many male as female applicants, while the proportion is \nalmost reversed for course-based Master’s programs. Female applicants tend to have a higher \nyield rate than their male counterparts. \n24 \nThe following graph shows the total number2 of applications for admission to graduate \nprograms, the number of admissions offered and the number of subsequent registrations. This \napproach counts applications, not applicants: some applicants may have submitted multiple \napplications.  We continue to be competitive, admitting only about one third of the students who \napply to our graduate programs. The yield rate moves in tandem with the rate of admission, \nwhich gives stability and predictability – factors that are especially important for funding \nprojections. \nFall Proportion \nin total year \n2007-08 2008-09 2009-10 2010-11 2011-12 2012-13 2013-14 2014-15 2015-16 \nApplications 85% 85% 86% 85% 85% 82% 81% 81% 81% \nApplicants Admitted 80% 80% 81% 80% 78% 75% 77% 74% 73% \nApplicants Registered 79% 78% 80% 79% 76% 73% 75% 72% 74% \nSource: Strategic Analysis and Data Warehousing – accessed December 3, 2016. \nNotes: (1) *Academic year figures (Sept to Aug) for 2016-17 were extracted from December archive, which includes \nFall term numbers only.

While it is not entirely clear what is driving this increase, the dismal academic \njob market is likely to be part of the reason. This year we have indicated the average amount of \ntime spent on approved Leave of Absence (LOA). Such leaves currently include parental, \nmedical and a small number of compassionate leaves. As of January 2017, students may also \ntake professional leaves to pursue career-building internships and similar opportunities. We \nknow from other analyses that taking formal LOA increases the likelihood of completion, \nparticularly among doctoral students, even though it will obviously increase program length. \nCourse-based Master’s programs have become shorter, possibly because they have a higher \nproportion of international students, who consistently demonstrate shorter completion times (see \nTable 3.3). \nConvocation Year PhD M-T M-C Average LOA \n2007 6.09 3.43 3.03 0.70 \n2008 6.29 3.47 3.11 0.70 \n2009 6.25 3.49 2.98 0.79 \n2010 6.52 3.39 2.76 0.74 \n2011 6.28 3.33 2.63 0.71 \n2012 6.26 3.32 2.80 0.66 \n2013 6.22 3.30 2.87 0.79 \n2014 6.17 3.31 2.70 0.84 \n2015 6.33 3.34 2.72 0.74 \n2016 6.72 3.41 2.79 0.84 \nM-T = Thesis-Based Master’s, M-C = Course-Based Master’s (D=Domestic) (Int.=International), LOA = Leave of Absence \nSource: Strategic Analysis and Data Warehousing – accessed December 3, 2016.   \nNotes: (1) Convocation year = calendar year ( January 1 to December 31); (2) Figures show average completion time \nin years; (3) Completion time calculated as: first term of attendance to milestone completion date; (4) Any time spent \nin an official Leave of Absence (LOA) has not been deducted from the total completion time; (5) Excludes students in \nother program categories (qualifying, visiting and probationary students as well as people registered in post \nbaccalaureate certificates or postgraduate diplomas). \n31 \nIn every single year, in every type of degree, international graduate students complete their \ndegrees faster than domestic students do.

We have extended the length of \nour analysis back to 1999-2000 in order to highlight trends, which are the most reliable \nindicators given the complexity of calculating attrition rates. In general, Master’s attrition rates \nare falling. Doctoral attrition remains an area of concern. While we would never want the attrition \nrate to be 0% - because a PhD is not for everybody – it is particularly expensive to both \nstudents and the institution when doctoral students leave late in their programs. \nIn the chart below, each cohort of graduate students starting in a given academic year has been \ndivided into those who still had an active registration as of June 2015 and those who have \nobtained a degree. The remainder (“in attrition”) consists of those who have left the University \nwithout any credential. Students currently recorded as “still active” may either convocate or \nleave their program without a degree. Thus attrition rates become increasingly speculative as \nwe move toward the present. \nIn the aggregate table that follows, we decline to calculate attrition rates for cohorts that fall \nwithin the average time to completion of a PhD (~6 years, or 2011-12) – of course, this hides \nthe Master’s rates. The program-specific tables that follow break out this information more fully.  \nApplicants Registered Convocations Still Active In Attrition Attrition rate \n1999-00 1,284 1,035 0 249 19% \n2000-01 1,351 1,143 0 208 15% \n2001-02 1,441 1,209 1 231 16% \n2002-03 1,630 1,379 0 251 15% \n2003-04 1,739 1,481 0 258 15% \n2004-05 1,654 1,403 0 251 15% \n2005-06 1,601 1,361 4 236 15% \n2006-07 1,825 1,537 8 280 15% \n2007-08 2,026 1,716 19 291 14% \n2008-09 2,085 1799 32 254 ~12% \n2009-10 2,367 2004 95 268 ~11% \n2010-11 2221 1797 191 233 ~10% \n2011-12 2337 1763 340 234 ~10% \n2012-13 2274 1448 600 226 N/A \n2013-14 2331 1240 901 190 N/A \n2014-15 2171 571 1453 147 N/A \n2015-16 2201 53 2066 82 N/A \nFall 2016 1942 0 1941 1 N/A \nSource: Extracted from PeopleSoft; internal script \nNotes: (1) Figures are calculated taking into account the convocant's program at the time of admission; (2) Excludes \nstudents in other program categories (qualifying, visiting and probationary students as well as people registered in \npost baccalaureate certificates or postgraduate diplomas); (3) Academic year figures (Sept to Aug) for 2016-17 were \nextracted from December archive, which includes Fall term numbers only; (4) ~ = approximately. \n33 \nAttrition rates become increasingly speculative as we move to the present. Since the average \ntime to completion for PhD students at the University of Alberta is greater than six years, the \nattrition rates from 2011-12 onward should be disregarded, and those for the preceding two or \nthree years used only cautiously. Tracking the absolute number of convocating, still active and \nremaining students is useful to view over time, and that is why those figures have been reported \nhere. \nImportantly, these tables do not indicate when students leave the PhD program. Generally \nspeaking, the later, the more expensive – for both students and the university. The rule that \nstudents complete candidacy exams within the first 36 months of a PhD program is designed to \nprovide a solid checkpoint before students get too far along. \nApplicants registered Convocations Still active In attrition Attrition rate \n1999-00 327 231 0 96 29% \n2000-01 351 267 0 84 24% \n2001-02 386 300 0 86 22% \n2002-03 413 325 0 88 21% \n2003-04 440 354 0 86 20% \n2004-05 392 283 0 109 28% \n2005-06 376 280 2 94 25% \n2006-07 455 343 7 105 23% \n2007-08 450 347 15 88 20% \n2008-09 477 376 20 81 ~17% \n2009-10 547 395 73 79 ~14% \n2010-11 507 303 136 68 ~13% \n2011-12 502 204 225 73 N/A \n2012-13 532 74 379 79 N/A \n2013-14 469 29 389 51 N/A \n2014-15 458 6 401 51 N/A \n2015-16 452 0 420 32 N/A \nFall 2016 357 0 357 0 N/A \nSource: PeopleSoft; internal script \nNotes: (1) Figures are calculated taking into account the convocant's program at the time of admission.

The Canadian Association for Graduate Studies (CAGS) publishes annual \nStatistical Reports on enrolments by degree, by province, by field of study and by demographic \ncharacteristics. It correlates data from all graduate degree granting Canadian universities. \nThe second source of information comes from the U15 Group of Canadian Research \nUniversities Data Exchange. This data provides a better basis for comparison. However, it is not \npublic.  \nFor this year’s Graduate Enrolment report, we focused on recent U15 material that allows us to \ncompare the University of Alberta’s thesis-based degrees (both Master’s and PhD) with those of \nour peers in two areas: rate of completion, and time to completion. While we are not at liberty to \nreproduce raw data, we can describe the latest results of a recurrent analysis. \nIn June 2014, the U15 Group of Canadian Research Universities released a study of graduate \nstudents’ academic progression for the cohorts of doctoral students who began their programs \nin 2003 and 2007, and for the research master's cohort that began in 2007. A team at the \nUniversité de Montréal prepared the study, which is the twelfth set of published results on times \nto completion for graduate students in Canadian institutions. \nThe times to completion study follows students forward, defining a cohort at the beginning of \ntheir programs and tracking calendar time elapsed until the last term of study. For doctoral \nstudents, the measure of success is degree completion, whereas for Master’s students, success \nis measured in terms of completion or promotion to a doctoral program. The results include \nabsolute completion rates, length of study and cumulative completion rates over time. (The \nauthors note that the distribution of students across disciplinary divisions can significantly affect \nboth average completion rates and completion times.)4 \nOverall, student cohorts at the University of Alberta show high rates of program completion (or \npromotion): both the 2003 doctoral cohort and the 2007 master’s cohort are above the U15 \naverage for success in this category, with the doctoral cohort ranking 4th in the U15. The rate of \ncompletion for University of Alberta doctoral candidates has also steadily improved over time.  \nDegree completion after nine years by the 1999 doctoral cohort was below the U15 average, \nwhereas, five years later, the 2003 cohort had a nearly 10% higher completion rate, well above \nthe U15 average. \nIn contrast, times to completion for both doctoral and research Master’s students at the \nUniversity of Alberta are relatively high. Compared to the U15 average, students in the 2003 \ndoctoral cohort took, on average, 1 term longer to complete their programs, and those in the \n2007 research master’s cohort took an additional 1.6 terms to complete their degrees.  \n4 For example, in the 2003 doctoral cohort, the Sciences and Health Sciences students had the highest \ncompletion rates (U15 average above 77%), whereas the Engineering students had the fastest \ncompletion times (U15 average of 4.9 years). In an internal UofA multi-variate analysis conducted during \nthe last year, our data demonstrates that students in the Health Sciences are most likely to complete \n(though there is a range, from a low of 70% in Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences to a high of 89% \ncompletion in Medicine and Dentistry). Engineering doctoral students complete at the rate of 76%: the \nsame as ALES and Nursing. \n37 \nCombined completion and retention of the 2007 doctoral cohort after five years at the university, \nan early indicator of success, is just below the U15 average. However, given longer-than-\naverage completion times in the 2003 cohort and a high percentage of students still enrolled at \nthe time of the study, the overall success rate for the 2007 doctoral cohort may still be strong. \nAlthough we must close on a note of caution, since some of this data is soft and important \nvariation (by program, by field of study, by international vs domestic, etc.) can be obscured by \ngeneralization, the key takeaways here are that our thesis-based Master’s and PhD students \nhave strong rates of degree completion, and we have been improving our time-to-degree, \nrelative to our peer institutions. \nItem No. 17C \nGENERAL FACULTIES COUNCIL\n For the Meeting of January 30, 2017 \nOUTLINE OF ISSUE \nAdvice, Discussion, Information Item \nAgenda Title: University of Alberta Museums Annual Report for the Period \n  July 1, 2015 – September  30, 2016 \nItem \nProposed by Janine Andrews, Executive Director, Museums and Collections Services, \nand Jocelyn Hall, Chair, University of Alberta Museums Policy and \nPlanning Committee (Associate Professor and Associate Chair \n[Undergraduate], Department of Biological Sciences) \nPresenter Janine Andrews, Executive Director, Museums and Collections Services, \nand Jocelyn Hall, Chair, University of Alberta Museums Policy and \nPlanning Committee (Associate Professor and Associate Chair \n[Undergraduate], Department of Biological Sciences) \nDetails \nResponsibility Provost and Vice-President (Academic) \nThe Purpose of the item is \n(please be specific) \nTo file an annual report, as requested, with General Faculties Council.  \nTimeline/Implementation Date This Annual Report covers a reporting period of July 1, 2015 – \nSeptember 30, 2016 \nSupplementary Notes and \ncontext \nN/A \nEngagement and Routing (Include meeting dates) \nParticipation: \n(parties who have seen the \nproposal and in what capacity) \n<For further information see \nthe link posted on \nthe Governance Toolkit section \nStudent Participation Protocol> \nThose who have been informed: \n• Acting Vice-Provost (Learning Services) (as non-voting member\nof the Policy and Planning Committee)\nThose who have been consulted: \n• University of Alberta Museums Policy and Planning Committee\n(November 11-15, 2016) for review and approval via electronic\nvote.\nThose who are actively participating: \n• N/A\nAlignment/Compliance \nAlignment with Guiding \nDocuments \nN/A \nCompliance with Legislation, \nPolicy and/or Procedure \nRelevant to the Proposal \n(please quote legislation and \ninclude identifying section \nnumbers) \n1.

The Policy and \nPlanning committee agreed that this collection \nshould fall under the UAPPOL Museum \nand Collections Policy as the objects in the \ncollection are by definition museum objects \n(rare and irreplaceable). \n • The Committee voted unanimously to approve \nthe deaccession of the last groupings of \nobjects from the Dentistry Collection via an \nelectronic vote. \n2.1\nactivity one\nUniversity of Alberta Museums  \nand Collections Policy  \nThe following key policy compliance tasks \nand activities were discussed: \nFAST FACTS\nCurator of the Mammalogy \nCollection, Andrew Derocher,  \nco-authored a study on the \nmigratory response of polar  \nbears to sea ice loss that \nwas published in the peer-\nreviewed journal Ecography.\n7 university of alberta museums: july 1, 2015 — sep. 30, 2016 annual report\n2.2\nactivity two\nResearch Collection  \nPurpose-Built Facilities  \nThe University of Alberta Museums has \nworked with various departments, faculties \nand Building Services to ensure that adequate \nstorage facilities exist for short and long-term \ncare of the University of Alberta Museums \ncollections. For the continued evolution \nand operation of the University of Alberta \nMuseums research collection facilities, \npurpose-built spaces are still required and the \nPolicy and Planning Committee and Curators \ncontinued to discuss this need.\nThe following facility updates and issues for \nthe University of Alberta Museums collec-\ntions were reported during this period: \n • Human Ecology’s Clothing and Textile \nCollection is looking into installing a new \nsecurity system with cameras to address the \nthreat of vandalism and theft.\n • Negotiations continue in order to move the \nLaboratory for Vertebrate Paleontology \ncollection (approximately 50,000 specimens) \nto the Centennial Centre for Interdisciplinary \nScience (CCIS) to improve storage conditions.\n • The Parasite Collection’s dry slide collection \n(21,000 specimens) was relocated from \nthe fourth floor of the Biological Sciences \nbuilding to the seventh floor. \n • The Vascular Plant Herbarium converted an \nadjacent room into a preparatory space to \nallow for safer integration of new material \ninto the collection. This new prep room will \nallow for proper inspection and drying of \nspecimens prior to them entering the main \nstorage area, which will better protect the \nexisting collection from potential infestation. \n • The type specimens from the Paleobotanical \nCollection were relocated from the sub-\nbasement of the Zoology Wing in the \nBiological Sciences to the fourth floor of \nthe Botany Wing and underwent a complete \ninventory and digitization during this \nprocess. Additionally, the acetate peels in the \nPaleobotanical Collection were successfully \nrelocated to the fourth floor of the Botany \nWing into a much more suitable environment \nthat will aid in their long-term preservation.\n • The University of Alberta Museum of \nZoology’s Mammalogy Collection underwent \na major storage reorganization and \nimprovement project in the summer of 2015. \nThe collection was collated and reorganized \nonto the eleventh floor of the Biological \nSciences building. A complete inventory of \nthe collection is ongoing as a direct result of \nthis project.\n • The Pathology Gross Teaching Collection \nunderwent storage upgrades to protect wet \nspecimens in the Pathology Museum from \ndamage.

Several specimens required \ntreatment to clean and disinfect them. One \nspecimen was permanently damaged as a \nresult of staining from the infestation. Mice \nwere also found near collection spaces in the \nbasement of the Henry Marshall Tory building.\n •  Water issues continue to be a concern in the \nstorage and lab spaces for the Laboratory \nfor Vertebrate Paleontology collection. With \nheavy rainfalls in the summer, leaks were \ndiscovered along the North-East walls and \nunder the wooden flooring. Building Services \nassessed the leaks and determined the leaks \nare part of larger structural problems with the \nbuilding.\nThere are approximately 120 locations on \ncampus that house collections.

However, the motion requesting new \nfunds of $350,000 per year was withdrawn \nby City Councillors and therefore not \ndeliberated by City Council during the budget \nmeetings, thus ending the collaboration \neffective March 31, 2016. \nThe Policy and Planning Committee and \nCurators discussed this initiative. The \nmajority along with the University of Alberta \nMuseums remain committed to this space \nfor these reasons:\n • The University of Alberta Museums require \nspace to present the diverse and extensive \nmuseum collections and their associated \nknowledge to a broad public audience;\n • With the University of Alberta focus on \ncommunity engagement, this venue provides \na location through which the University of \nAlberta can involve diverse communities of \nnot only the collections on campus, but the \nUniversity as a whole;\n • To remain accredited and be eligible for \nmuseum grants, the University of Alberta \nMuseums and the associated collections \nrequire space to provide access to the \nAlberta public and beyond;\n • The gallery space at Enterprise Square \nmeets environmental requirements such \nas temperature, humidity, and security \nfor exhibiting collections that are museum \nquality and certified as cultural property.\nHowever, the Policy and Planning Committee, \nCurators, and University of Alberta Museums \nalso recognize the following issues: there \nis currently no long-term commitment for \nthe space and no commitment to funding in \norder to operate the space. The combination \nof these two factors makes it difficult to \ndevelop a long-term plan, create efficiencies, \nbuild community partnerships, and seek out \nexternal funding opportunities. \nA funding request for $350,000 has been \ngranted by the Office of the Provost for  \nthe 2016/17 year to continue operations and \nprogramming for the University of Alberta \nMuseums Galleries at Enterprise Square on  \na one-year basis.\n Left to Right: Lyndal Osborne, \nLiz Ingram, Walter Jule\n11 university of alberta museums: july 1, 2015 — sep. 30, 2016 annual report\nInternship Programs \nThe Committee adjudicated applications to the \nFriends of the University of Alberta Museums \nInternship in Museum Innovation again in both \n2015 and 2016.

Faculty \nDeans (or designate) make recommendations for severe \nsanctions in academic misconduct cases, while University \nof Alberta Protective Services (UAPS) or Unit Directors \nThe two Discipline Officers completed a total of 61 decisions \nin the 2015/16 academic year. In order to align the numbers \nwith those collected by the Appeals and Compliance Officer, \nthe decisions counted in this report include those in which the \nappeal deadline falls between July 1, 2015, and June 30, 2016. \nThe matters before the Discipline Officers are complex, often \ninvolving legal or procedural considerations. Investigations take \non average 23.5 hours to complete, although the time required \nranged from 7 hours for the simplest decision to 177 hours for \nthe most complex. The majority of the cases fell within the 15-\n30 hour range. \nMost academic violations are handled solely at the Faculty level \nwith Intermediate Sanctions under the Code. Appropriately, \nonly the most egregious cases are referred to SCA with \nrecommendations for Severe Sanctions. These cases tend to \nbe more complex in nature and often involve prior offences. \nBecause the statistics cited herein apply strictly to Student \nConduct and Accountability, any trends identified in terms of \nacademic misconduct must not be generalized to the entire \nUniversity. For a total number of academic offences that did not \ninvolve a referral to the Discipline Officer, please refer to the \nAppeals Coordinator’s report from University Governance.\nmake recommendations for charges and sanctions in non-\nacademic misconduct cases. The Discipline Officer meets \nwith the student alleged to have committed the misconduct, \ninvestigates the complaint if the facts are in dispute, and makes \na finding on whether the student violated the Code. If the \nstudent is found responsible, the Discipline Officer decides \nwhat sanctions are warranted, using the recommendation from \nthe complainant as a starting point.\nThroughout the 2015/16 academic year, Deborah Eerkes and \nChris Hackett were the two Discipline Officers under the Code \nof Student Behaviour.\nUAPS investigates allegations of non-academic misconduct, \nand of those that fall under the Code of Student Behaviour, \nsends recommendations for charges and sanctions to the \nDiscipline Officer. In addition, Unit Directors can recommend \ncharges and sanctions to the Discipline Officer for allegations \nof Inappropriate Use of University Property and Resources \nrelating to their own units. \nFinally, the Discipline Officers are responsible to make decisions \nin two kinds of appeals: \n1. Students can appeal a UAPS Violation Notice to the \nDiscipline Officer when they are disputing the facts. The \nDiscipline Officer can uphold or deny the appeal, or vary \nthe fine on the Violation Notice. \n2. The second type of appeal relates to complaints made to \nUAPS in which the Director decides not to recommend \ncharges under the Code. The complainant can appeal to \nthe Discipline Officer, who makes a decision on whether \nit was reasonable not to lay charges under the Code, or \nwhether an investigation should proceed. In the latter case, \nthe Discipline Officer will initiate an investigation, make a \nfinding and render a decision. This is a change to procedure \nin the Code of Student Behaviour that took effect in \nSeptember 2015, and significantly simplifies the process.\nDISCIPLINE CASES\n2\nThe 61 case files for the 2015/16 academic year showed an \noverall increase of 38% over the previous year. Three of those \ncases were student appeals, and did not involve charges against \nstudents. The complexity and seriousness of the offences is \nreflected in the sanctions imposed in the remaining 58 cases, \nincluding 3 expulsions, 9 exclusions, 29 suspensions, 45 orders \nof conduct probation, 3 fines, and 2 orders of restitution. \nTRENDS\nCharges were dismissed in 3 cases.  The marked increase \nin severe sanctions is indicative of the increase in serious \nincidents coming before the Discipline Officers.  Of the 58 \ncases involving charges, 7 were appealed to the University \nAppeal Board (UAB); 3 were varied (charges upheld), 4 others \nwere still pending at the writing of this report.\nDisposition\n2015/16\nExpulsion  3%\nSuspension  31%\nConduct Probation  48%\nFine  3%\nExclusion  10%\nRestitution  2%\nCharges dismissed; no sanction  3%\nFig. 1  Disposition of Decisions of the Discipline Officer\nFig. 2  Severe Sanctions - 3 year comparison\nSuspension\nExpulsion\n3\n0\n12\n6\n18\n3\n15\n24\n27\n30\n9\n21\n2013/14 2014/15\nN\nu\nm\nb\ner\n o\nf S\nan\nct\nio\nn\ns\n2015/16\nFig. 3  Disposition of Decisions of the Discipline Officer – 3 year comparison\nNote: Some cases result in multiple sanctions, therefore the total number of \nsanctions imposed (94) is greater than the number of cases (61).\n* In addition to any sanctions imposed by Dean or Unit Director\nDISCIPLINE OFFICER SANCTION*\nNUMBER IMPOSED\n2013/14 2014/15 2015/16\nExpulsion 1 5 3\nSuspension 6 18 29\nConduct Probation 24 27 45\nFine 1 2 3\nExclusion 3 7 9\nSuspension University Resources 1 0 0\nRestitution 2 2 2\nReprimand 3 0 0\nCharges upheld; no additional sanction 0 0 0\nCharges dismissed; no sanction 6 4 3\nTotal Sanctions 47 65 94\nCOMPLAINANT \nNUMBER OF CASES COMPLETED\n2013/14 2014/15 2015/16\nACADEMIC\nAgricultural, Life and Environmental Sciences 0 2 0\nArts 3 6 10\nAugustana 0 0 2\nBusiness 2 1 6\nEngineering 1 1 1\nExtension 0 2 2\nFaculty of Graduate Studies and Research 2 3 1\nScience 2 3 1\nNON-\nACADEMIC\nUniversity of Alberta Protective Services 31 25 35\nStudent - Appeal of Violation Notice 2 0 1\nStudent - Appeal of UAPS decision not to proceed N/A N/A 2\nFaculties submitted 26 of our 58 files in which students were \ncharged with academic offences, while roughly 57% came \nfrom University of Alberta Protective Services (non-academic \nmisconduct).

Some statistics for previous years are also included \nfor comparison. \nThis report sets out information about discipline decisions and the appeal process under the Code of Student \nBehaviour (COSB) and the Code of Applicant Behaviour (COAB), with a focus on the university appeal level of the \nUniversity Appeal Board (UAB). This report also sets out information for the two other university level appeal \nbodies, the General Faculties Council Academic Appeals Committee (GFC AAC) and the General Faculties Council \nPractice Review Board (GFC PRB). \nRole of the Appeals Coordinator \nAs Appeals and Compliance Officer, I carry out the role of the Appeals Coordinator under the COSB, COAB, \nUniversity of Alberta Academic Appeals Policy and University of Alberta Practicum Intervention Policy for the \nUAB, GFC AAC and GFC PRB. In this role I am neutral and do not advocate for either party in an appeal. I \nfacilitate or administer the appeal process steps from the time an appeal is received, through the hearing and decision \nmade by an appeal panel, to distribution of the written decision. I also provide procedural information to the parties \nto an appeal and to the appeal panel throughout the appeal process. \nApart from individual appeals, I oversee the university level appeal system to ensure that the university continues to \nimplement a fair process by which to address appeals. This includes helping to educate panel members as to the \nframework within which they work when hearing appeals and attempting to help the university community \nunderstand that framework. This report is intended to aid in that understanding. \nUniversity Level Appeal Process \nThe university level appeal system is made up of three main appeal bodies – the UAB, the GFC AAC and the GFC \nPRB.  \nDiscipline decisions arise as a result of a student being charged with an offence (academic and/or non-academic) \nunder the COSB or COAB. When the appropriate decision-maker has made a final decision finding an offence and \nimposing a sanction, the parties to that decision have a final appeal to the UAB. \nPage 2 of 4  \nAttachment 1.0 \nThe UAB generally hears appeals from students charged under the COSB or COAB who disagree with the discipline \ndecisions. UAB decisions are final and binding, within the university, subject to judicial review. Under the COSB \nthe UAB has the broad authority to determine whether an offence was committed and to confirm, vary or quash \nsanctions imposed. \nUnder the Academic Appeal Policy, academic standing issues are heard by the GFC AAC. The GFC AAC hears \nappeals from students wishing to appeal faculty decisions on matters of academic standing, including matters such \nas a requirement to withdraw, denial of graduation or promotion. The GFC AAC hears appeals from students after \nthey have exhausted all other avenues of appeal within a faculty. GFC AAC decisions are final and binding, within \nthe university, subject to judicial review. The authority of the GFC AAC is to uphold (and award any remedy not \ncontrary to faculty rules) or deny an appeal depending upon whether a miscarriage of justice, as defined by the \nAcademic Appeals Policy, occurred within the faculty process.  \nUnder the Practicum Intervention Policy, appeals concerning practicum interventions are heard by the GFC PRB. \nThe GFC PRB’s decisions are final and binding, within the university, subject to judicial review. \nA fourth body, the Three Person Panel under section 30.5.2(8) of the COSB, also existed to address appeals of \ndecisions to not proceed with complaints. The COSB was revised on October 1, 2015 to eliminate the Three Person \nPanel and set up a new system of appeal for such decisions. The Three Person Panel heard no appeals during the \nperiod of this report. \nPrinciples of the Appeal Process  \nAppeals at the university level deal with complex issues affecting students, faculties and the university as a whole. \nGiven this impact, and the fact that this final level of appeal is the last opportunity for issues to be heard within the \nuniversity, it is very important that the appeal process is fair and perceived to be fair. Coming to decisions through a \nfair process also promotes confidence in those decisions by the parties and the appeal panels themselves. Being the \nfinal level of appeal, the decisions or process may also be subject to judicial scrutiny. \nThe authority of the appeal bodies (UAB/GFC AAC/GFC PRB) flows from the powers delegated under the Post-\nSecondary Learning Act. The appeal bodies carry out their authority as outlined in the applicable university appeal \npolicy, in keeping with the principles of administrative fairness. The principles of administrative fairness are the \nbasis for our appeals policies, help us to interpret those policies and provide the framework within which our appeal \npanels make decisions.    \nThe formal steps of our appeals process recognize the impact and finality of these decisions and ensure the \nopportunity for parties to an appeal to make their best cases and be heard. Our appeals process is not a court process, \nbut has been designed to allow for students and university decision-makers to be able to be heard by an objective \npanel coming from the university community. The system is flexible in that it is able to deal with a wide variety of \nappeals and circumstances (from students and university staff representing themselves or being helped by an advisor \nof their choosing) through consistently applying basic principles of administrative fairness. At its core, our appeals  \nPage 3 of 4  \nAttachment 1.0 \nsystem involves the parties fully making their cases in writing and knowing the case of the other side before an \nappeal hearing, then appearing at a hearing where they are able to present and question their arguments and \ninformation before an objective appeal panel. (The UAB process also allows for the option of a paper-only or \ndocumentary review hearing, rather than an in-person hearing, when only the severity of sanction, and not the \noffence, is being appealed.) The appeal panel then considers and weighs all of the submissions of the parties and \ncomes to a decision, which it fully explains to the parties in writing. \nCurrent Trends \nLooking at the attached statistics, after a significant increase over the past recent years in the number of appeals to \nthe university level appeal bodies, this year saw a decrease in the number of appeals. (The current year-to-date \nsuggests we may again see an increase in the next reporting period.) Compared to the previous year, 2015-2016 saw \na similar number of overall decisions made by Deans, with the majority of those decisions concerning the academic \noffences of plagiarism and cheating. Although not statistically tracked, a significant number of appeals are received \nfrom international students.   \n2015-2016 also saw an increase in the number, complexity and time spent addressing issues (including dealing with \nparties' legal counsel) of appeals to the UAB of non-academic offences under the COSB.  \nAppeal panels have continued to address complex issues during the appeal process. This includes procedural \nrequests and issues raised by the parties to appeals both before and during hearings. When such issues are raised, the \nappeal panel chair (and sometimes the full appeal panel) must decide how to address the issue, consider the \narguments and circumstances, and then come to a decision to fairly address the issue. The chair (and sometimes full \npanel) does this through consultation with the Appeals Coordinator, obtaining legal advice when necessary. Again, \nall such decisions are made consistently with the relevant appeals policy and principles of administrative fairness, \nwith the aim of providing both parties a fair opportunity to be heard. Appeals involving legal counsel representing \none or both parties are often of a complex nature, and often take more time throughout the process. Depending on \nthe number and type of procedural issues raised or requests made by the parties during an appeal, the timeframe for \ncompletion of appeals varies. The majority of appeals are completed within one to two months, from the time the \nappeal is received to an appeal decision being made. \nI have continued to promote an understanding of the steps within the appeal process, and the principles upon which \nthey are based, by being available as a resource for parties and panels throughout the course of individual appeals, as \nwell as by meeting with a variety of student and staff groups within our university community.   \nAppeal Panel Membership \nAll of the university level appeal panels are made up of volunteers. While the exact makeup of a panel depends on \nthe applicable appeal policy, generally the panels are a combination of undergraduate/graduate students and \nacademic staff selected from the university’s appeal panel membership lists. (Membership is determined by an \napplication process and ultimately by approval of applicants by GFC.) Members serve on approximately six appeal  \nPage 4 of 4  \nAttachment 1.0 \npanels within a calendar year, but this number varies depending on the number of appeals received and the faculties \ninvolved. Appeal panel members come from the greatest variety of faculties possible. For objectivity, no appeal \npanel member may sit on an appeal involving a party from their faculty. Appeal hearings are scheduled throughout \nthe academic year, including summer, mostly in evenings around academic schedules. Student panel members \nusually serve for two year terms, while academic staff panel members usually serve for three year terms (with the \npossibility of serving additional terms).  \nIn addition to their understanding of the university environment from their experience as students (both \nundergraduate and graduate) and academic staff, our panel members are provided ongoing training in understanding \nthe principles of administrative fairness within which their tribunals operate. This helps to ensure that, as discussed \nabove, the appeal process is a fair one, with both parties to an appeal being given the opportunity to fully make their \ncases to an objective decision-maker.    \nThe service of appeal panel members is a significant commitment, including considering and addressing procedural \nissues arising before and during hearings, conducting hearings, deliberating and drafting written reasons for \ndecisions. All of our panel members recognize the need to objectively hear submissions from parties to an appeal, \nanalyze and weigh evidence, then come to reasonable decisions based on that evidence. I try to ensure that appeal \npanels have all the needed resources to perform this role. I thank all of the appeal panel members for serving our \nuniversity community, often addressing difficult issues involving student careers, faculty standards and the integrity \nand values of the university. Our appeal panels uphold the values of fair decision-making, of a fair appeal process \nand of the university as a whole, for both students and faculty. \nMichael Peterson \nAppeals and Compliance Officer \nUniversity Governance, University of Alberta  \nNovember 16, 2016 \nAttachments: Statistics for Discipline Decisions and the University Level Appeal Process \n[Statistics based upon year of appeal deadline.]   \nAttachment 2.0 \nINDEX OF ATTACHMENTS \nNumber of Appeals Received  Attachment 2.1 \nFigure 1 ...................................................................................................................................................

Attachment 1: Office of Safe Disclosure and Human Rights (OSDHR) Annual Report 2015-16\nPrepared by:  Sarah Flower, Advisor (Safe Disclosure and Human Rights), sarah.flower@ualberta.ca \nmailto:Sarah\nOffice of Safe Disclosure and \nHuman Rights (OSDHR) \nAnnual Report 2015-16 \nProgram Goals \nThe Office of Safe Disclosure & Human Rights (OSDHR) has two functions: the provision of \nthe University of Alberta’s confidential disclosure services; and human rights promotion \nand consulting.  The office provides intake, advisory and educational services to students, \nstaff and faculty at all University of Alberta campuses.  \nIn addition, OSDHR supports and manages the Helping Individuals at Risk (HIAR) program, \nwhich reports separately.  \nThis report spans the period of July 1, 2015 - June 30th, 2016. \nDisclosure Activity \nOSDHR operates on a confidential intake and referral model.  Individuals or groups that \nmake disclosures to the office are referred to the most appropriate university service \nprovider(s) in order for the matter to be addressed.    \nThe OSDHR launched an online reporting tool that allows reports to be securely submitted \nvia the web.  This augments the existing reporting mechanisms and enhances the office’s \nability to receive reports. \nThe OSDHR provided intake and referral services for 118 disclosures during the reporting \nyear, mostly reported by staff and faculty. The majority of disclosures related to harassment \nand discrimination, but allegations on a wide variety of matters including safety, fraud and \nthe application of collective agreements were disclosed.   \nPublic Interest Disclosure Act (PIDA) Disclosures \n The University Auditor is the university’s Designated Officer under the Public Interest \nDisclosure Act (PIDA); one complaint was made formally under the Act. The OSDHR is \nresponsible meeting the University of Alberta’s obligations under the Public Interest \nDisclosure Act regarding intake and awareness activities. \nReferrals \nMatters reported to the Office are typically referred to existing campus resources for \nresolution. The OSDHR maintains a working relationship with the various resources to \nensure delivery of effective referral services.  \nSummary of Disclosure Activity \nTable 1.

The office also engages in a variety of activities that \nsupport the objectives of the Discrimination, Harassment and Duty to Accommodate Policy \nthat states “The University is enriched by diversity, and it welcomes and seeks to include \nmany voices, including those that have been under-represented or excluded.” Training and \ncoaching activities included 38 in-person training sessions, the development of online \ntraining materials, such as videos, and multiple advisory conversations with members of the \nUniversity community, including senior leadership.  In additional training was delivered at \nnew employee orientation, Gold Leadership College, the supervisory leadership program \nand student orientations. \nThe office also supports various processes and committees, such as scholarship \ndevelopment and GFC sub-committees, by providing advice on human rights policies and \nbest-practices. \nOSDHR collaborates with various campus service providers on projects that promote a \npositive human rights environment and the university, such as Equity Diversity and \nInclusion Week, the Visiting Lectureship in Human Rights and the Understanding Race in \nthe Academy project. \nWhen possible, the office collaborates with community organizations to lend expertise or \nbuild awareness of the University’s commitment to human rights. The OSDHR advisor \ncontributed to activities hosted by the Universal Design Conference, the MS Society of \nNorthern Alberta/NWT and the Edmonton Fringe Festival.   \nAreas of Focus for 2016-2017 \nStudent Engagement \nThe Office has assessed models to encourage student engagement and will be implementing \ninitiatives over the upcoming year to partner further with the student associations. \nImplementation of For the Public Good \nOSDHR will initiate and support activities that support “For the Public Good,” particularly \nthose related to equity. \nUnderstanding Race in the Academy Project \nIn conjunction with Human Resource Services, the office is undertaking a project that will \nengage campus in discussions about how race is experienced at the university. It is intended \nto provide broad guidance to the university on how to identify and address barriers related \nto race. \nPublic Interest Disclosure Act \nThe Select Special Ethics and Accountability Committee of the legislature has recommended \nchanges to the Public Interest Disclosure Act. If passed, these will expand the scope of \ndisclosure responsibilities for the university and the Designated Officer.  \nHelping Individuals at Risk \n(HIAR) \nAnnual Report 2015-16 \nProgram Goals \nHelping Individuals at Risk has the following objectives: \n• to encourage the campus community to “Trust Your Instincts,” to recognize and \nreport worrisome behaviours of those at risk of harm to self or others;  \n• to provide a confidential centralized location for reports of worrisome behaviour \nand to connect situations that would otherwise seem to be isolated incidents, and \nassess the reported behaviours; and  \n• to help connect Individuals at Risk to resources before a situation escalates. \nReports of Individuals at Risk \nThe HIAR program received 531 reports about 338 perceived Individuals at Risk, an \nincrease from the previous year in both the number of reports (26%) and the reported \nnumber of perceived Individuals at Risk (21%). These numbers demonstrate continued \ngrowth of the program, an average of 20% per year. \nFigure 1. Individuals at Risk and total reports by year \nThe majority of reports to the program (71%) continued to be regarding undergraduate \nstudents. Eleven percent were regarding graduate students, 6% were faculty or staff, 4% \nwere in open studies, 4% were about former students, 1% were Post-Doctoral Fellows and \nthe remainder (2%) were other (i.e. applicants, visiting students, or former employees). \nReports about International Students comprised 19% of all reports.  \n102 \n153 168 \n216 \n280 \n338 \n176 \n214 \n281 \n355 \n421 \n531 \n0\n100\n200\n300\n400\n500\n600\n2010-11 2011-12 2012-13 2013-14 2014-15 2015-16\nNumber of\nindividuals at\nrisk\nNumber of\nreports\nFigure 2. Status of Individuals at Risk, 2015-16 \nThe majority of perceived Individuals at Risk reported were male (54%); 44% were female \nand 2% were transgender. Most reports were about a behavioural concern (47%) wherein \nthe perceived Individual at Risk was exhibiting worrisome behaviour that did not yet meet \nthe assessment of harm. Thirty-nine percent of reports were regarding possible harm to \nself, 13% were regarding risk of harm to others, 1% concerned risk of both harm to self and \nothers, 1% concerned bullying, and there was one report about a disruption to the \ncommunity. \nFigure 3. Type of at-risk behaviour, 2015-16 \nThe number of reports about those exhibiting behavioural concerns increased again this \nyear, as did reports regarding academic concerns. HIAR plans to track the number of \nacademic concerns reported to the program next year to determine the number of reports \nreceived that could potentially be managed by other units (Student Services, Faculty or \nDepartment Advisors).  \nReporters of At Risk Behaviour \nThe greatest number of reports came from University of Alberta Protective Services (130 \nreports or 24%), staff members (94 reports or 18%) and instructors (82 reports or 15%).  \nLast year, instructors comprised only 10% of reports made to the program. This significant \nincrease in reports from instructors could be due to concerted effort by the HIAR \nCoordinator to present to faculty and department council meetings. \n378 \n56 \n33 \n22 22 8 12 \nUndergraduate\nGraduate\nFaculty and Staff\nFormer Students\n205 \n248 \n67 \n7 1 3 Harm to Self\nBehaviorual Concern\nHarm to Others\nHarm to Both\nFigure 4. Status of reporter of at-risk behaviour, 2015-16 \nA significant number of reports were also received from Residence Services (76 reports or \n14%), the Office of the Dean of Students/University Student Services (63 reports or 12%) \nand Senior Administrators (52 reports or 10%).  \nThe busiest months for receiving reports of At Risk Behaviour were October 2015 and \nMarch 2016.  Reports in December were high despite the Christmas closure. \nFigure 5. Number of reports by month, 2015-16 \nServices Provided \nMore than one service is often provided to a perceived Individual at Risk and/or the \nreporter, depending on the situation and the level of risk of the individual. Reports received \n“for information purposes”, with no action required, dropped significantly last year, which \nmeans that HIAR staff provided at least one service in 70% of the reports received. The \nmost common services delivered were follow-ups (33%), referrals for the Individual at Risk \n(29%) and referrals to the HIAR Case Team (20%) for assessment and action planning.  \nThere was also an increase (4%) in the percentage of reports in which HIAR staff contacted \nan Individual at Risk directly. \n130 \n94 \n82 \n76 \n63 \n52 \n16 10 5 3 Protective Services\nStaff Members\nInstructors/Professors\nResidence Services\nDean of Students\nSenior Administrators\nStudents\nHuman Resources Staff\nFamily Member\n17 \n24 \n45 \n60 \n54 54 53 54 \n67 \n49 \n28 26 \n0\n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\n60\n70\n80\nJuly\n'15\nAug\n'15\nSept\n'15\nOct\n'15\nNov\n'15\nDec\n'15\n Jan\n'16\nFeb\n'16\nMar\n'16\nApr\n'16\nMay\n'16\nJun\n'16\n2015-16\nTable 1.

A part-time position was added to the \nprogram in October 2015 with a focus on intake and management of reports.
