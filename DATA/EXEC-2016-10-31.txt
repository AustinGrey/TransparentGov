Attachment 1- GFC ad hoc Committee on Academic Governance including Delegation – Guiding \nPrinciples (2 pages) \nPrepared by: Meg Brolley, General Faculties Council (GFC) Secretary, meg.brolley@ualberta.ca   \nmailto:meg.brolley@ualberta.ca\n1 \nGFC AD HOC COMMITTEE ON ACADEMIC GOVERNANCE \nINCLUDING DELEGATED AUTHORITY \nAd hoc Committee on Academic Governance including Delegated Authority \nGuiding Principles \nIntroduction \nCharged, as it is, with making recommendations with regard to academic governance, the ad hoc \ncommittee began its work by identifying some of the core ‘guiding principles’ that should inform its \ndeliberations. \nWe understand ‘governance’ as the processes through which an organization defines and achieves its \nmandate. This includes making decisions with regard to the structures, policies, and practices of decision-\nmaking, the exercise of authority, and the mechanisms of accountability.  Good governance requires \ncollegial practice at all levels including the Board, the Executive and all members of the institution. \nUniversity governance is multi-level and bicameral. Provincial legislation – the Post-Secondary Learning \nAct (PSLA) – sets the framework for university governance. At the institutional level, the PSLA prescribes \nthat UAlberta will have bicameral institutions of governance – that is, there are two governing bodies. The \nBoard of Governors (the Board) oversees the business affairs of the institution – from appointing the \nPresident, through to approving budgets, investment strategies, collective agreements, and long-range \nstrategic planning. The General Faculties Council (GFC) oversees ‘academic affairs’. \nTo understand the operations of the university, it is important to note the distinction between ‘governance’ \nand ‘administration’. While the Board and GFC set policies and establish broad directions for the institution, \nthe university’s senior executive team is responsible for administrative operations, including operational \npolicies and decisions. And this is replicated at the Faculty and Departmental levels across the university.  \nThis ad hoc committee’s mandate pertains to reviewing academic governance at the institutional level. \nThus, we are to remain focused on the operations of GFC and its standing committees (including the \ndelegation of authority from GFC, the mandate and structure of committees, and related matters). \nBut, as a matter of principle, we embrace a reasonably expansive understanding of ‘academic affairs’ and, \nthus, GFC’s mandate. We support the notion that GFC must have the capacity to defend its legitimate role \nwith regard to issues that exist at the boundary between governance and administration, as well as \nbetween Board and GFC responsibilities. We also support the notion that GFC should have early \nopportunities to influence strategic decisions and directions that are set by the Board or administration, but \nimpinge on academic affairs. \nGuiding Principles \nAs a committee, we are committed to the principles of ‘collegial academic governance’. These principles \ninclude: \n• A desire to build mutual understanding of common goals and shared purpose – operationalized in \nnumerous ways, including the adoption of an institutional strategic plan. \n• A commitment to inclusive and participatory governance decision-making.  \n• A desire to facilitate meaningful individual-level engagement in governance processes. \n• A commitment to openness, transparency, and respectful communication.  \n• A commitment to responsiveness, respect, and reciprocity between governing bodies and between \ngoverning bodies and university administration.  \nAd Hoc Committee on Academic Governance including Delegated Authority \nGuiding Principles \n2 \nFurther Guiding Elements \nGuided by these principles, we begin our deliberations in agreement on the following: \n• GFC must take seriously its responsibility for academic affairs, and commit to showing leadership \non emerging issues and serving as a forum for discussing and taking decisions in the interest of \nacademic freedom, and excellence in research, creativity, teaching and learning. \n• While the standing Committees of GFC should have real power to make (or initiate) substantive \ndecisions, a commitment to regular and reciprocal communication should position GFC to ensure \nthat its members retain the capacity to bring significant issues to the floor of GFC for debate and \ndecision. Standing Committee chairs have a responsibility to identify issues that Standing \nCommittee members feel are deserving of discussion by full GFC. \n• The composition of GFC Standing Committees should reflect the principle of meaningful \nrepresentation of elected, appointed, and ex officio, and student, staff, and faculty membership. \n• While ensuring appropriate checks and balances are in place, appropriate consultations occur, and \ncompeting interests are always considered, GFC’s committee structure and decision making \nprocesses should be designed to ensure streamlined pathways for the consideration and, when \ndesired, approval of proposals flowing from Faculties and other units within the University. \n• Meetings of GFC must be conducted in a manner that encourages participation and engagement.  \n• Members of GFC, whether they are elected, appointed, or ex officio, student, staff, or faculty, \nshould be encouraged to represent the interests of any ‘constituency’ with which they are affiliated, \nwhile also considering competing interests and striving to consider (and define) the broader \ninstitutional interest. \nThis overview of the ad hoc committee’s guiding principles is, in many ways, incomplete, but it reflects our \nstarting point for considering the many issues before us. \nItem No. 4 \nGFC EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE \nFor the Meeting of October 31, 2016 \n OUTLINE OF ISSUE \nAction Item \nAgenda Title: Guiding Principles of the GFC ad hoc Committee on Academic Governance including \nDelegated Authority \nMotion:  THAT the GFC Executive Committee recommend that General Faculties Council endorse the \nGuiding Principles as presented by the GFC ad hoc Committee on Academic Governance including \nDelegated Authority and as set forth in Attachment 1. \nItem   \nAction Requested Approval Recommendation   \nProposed by GFC ad hoc Committee on Academic Governance including Delegated \nAuthority \nPresenter Mark Loewen, Chair and Steve Patten, Vice-Chair of the GFC ad hoc \nCommittee on Academic Governance including Delegated Authority \nDetails \nResponsibility David Turpin, President and Chair, General Faculties Council \nThe Purpose of the Proposal is \n(please be specific) \nTo present for endorsement by General Faculties Council, the principles \nwhich will guide the work of the ad hoc committee.  \nThe Impact of the Proposal is To provide GFC with an update on the direction that the work of the ad \nhoc committee is taking.  \nReplaces/Revises (eg, policies, \nresolutions) \nN/A \nTimeline/Implementation Date N/A \nEstimated Cost and funding \nsource \nN/A \nNext Steps (ie.: \nCommunications Plan, \nImplementation plans) \nThe ad hoc Committee will continue to meet on a regular basis to fulfill \nits mandate and will provide reports to the GFC Executive Committee \nand GFC on a regular basis.  \nFinal report and recommendations will be submitted to GFC on or before \n30 April 2016. \nSupplementary Notes and \ncontext \nEngagement and Routing (Include meeting dates) \nParticipation: \n(parties who have seen the \nproposal and in what capacity) \n<For further information see \nthe link posted on the \nGovernance Toolkit section \nStudent Participation Protocol> \nThose who have been informed: \nThose who have been consulted: \n• President \n• Provost and Vice-President (Academic) \n• GFC Executive Committee \nhttp://www.governance.ualberta.ca/GovernanceToolkit/Toolkit.aspx\nhttp://www.governance.ualberta.ca/GovernanceToolkit/Toolkit.aspx\nItem No. 4 \nGFC EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE \nFor the Meeting of October 31, 2016 \nThose who are actively participating: \n• GFC ad hoc Committee on Academic Governance including \nDelegation  \n• University Governance \nApproval Route (Governance) \n(including meeting dates) \nGFC Executive –October 31, 2016 (for recommendation) \nFinal Approver GFC –November 21, 2016 (for endorsement) \nAlignment/Compliance \nAlignment with Guiding \nDocuments \nFor the Public Good \nInstitutional Values  \nThe University of Alberta community of students, faculty, staff, and \nalumni rely on shared, deeply held values that guide behaviour and \nactions.

Attachment 1- GFC ad hoc Committee on Academic Governance including Delegation – Guiding \nPrinciples (2 pages) \nPrepared by: Meg Brolley, General Faculties Council (GFC) Secretary, meg.brolley@ualberta.ca   \nmailto:meg.brolley@ualberta.ca\n1 \nGFC AD HOC COMMITTEE ON ACADEMIC GOVERNANCE \nINCLUDING DELEGATED AUTHORITY \nAd hoc Committee on Academic Governance including Delegated Authority \nGuiding Principles \nIntroduction \nCharged, as it is, with making recommendations with regard to academic governance, the ad hoc \ncommittee began its work by identifying some of the core ‘guiding principles’ that should inform its \ndeliberations. \nWe understand ‘governance’ as the processes through which an organization defines and achieves its \nmandate. This includes making decisions with regard to the structures, policies, and practices of decision-\nmaking, the exercise of authority, and the mechanisms of accountability.   \nUniversity governance is multi-level and bicameral. Provincial legislation – the Post-Secondary Learning \nAct (PSLA) – sets the framework for university governance. At the institutional level, the PSLA prescribes \nthat UAlberta will have bicameral institutions of governance – that is, there are two governing bodies. The \nBoard of Governors (the Board) oversees the business affairs of the institution – from appointing the \nPresident, through to approving budgets, investment strategies, collective agreements, and long-range \nstrategic planning. The General Faculties Council (GFC) oversees ‘academic affairs’. \nTo understand the operations of the university, it is important to note the distinction between ‘governance’ \nand ‘administration’. While the Board and GFC set policies and establish broad directions for the institution, \nthe university’s senior executive team is responsible for administrative operations, including operational \npolicies and decisions. And this is replicated at the Faculty and Departmental levels across the university.  \nGood governance requires collegial practice at all levels including the Board, the executive and all \nmembers of the institution.  \nThis ad hoc committee’s mandate pertains to reviewing academic governance at the institutional level. \nThus, we are to remain focused on the operations of GFC and its standing committees (including the \ndelegation of authority from GFC, the mandate and structure of committees, and related matters). \nBut, as a matter of principle, we embrace a reasonably expansive understanding of ‘academic affairs’ and, \nthus, GFC’s mandate. We support the notion that GFC must have the capacity to defend its legitimate role \nwith regard to issues that exist at the boundary between governance and administration, as well as \nbetween Board and GFC responsibilities. We also support the notion that GFC should have early \nopportunities to influence strategic decisions and directions that are set by the Board or administration, but \nimpinge on academic affairs. \nGuiding Principles \nAs a committee, we are committed to the principles of ‘collegial academic governance’. These principles \ninclude: \n• A desire to build mutual understanding of common goals and shared purpose – operationalized in \nnumerous ways, including the adoption of an institutional strategic plan. \n• A commitment to inclusive and participatory governance decision-making.  \n• A desire to facilitate meaningful individual-level engagement in governance processes. \n• A commitment to openness, transparency, and respectful communication.  \n• A commitment to responsiveness, respect, and reciprocity between governing bodies and between \ngoverning bodies and university administration.  \nAd Hoc Committee on Academic Governance including Delegated Authority \nGuiding Principles \n2 \nFurther Guiding Elements \nGuided by these principles, we begin our deliberations in agreement on the following: \n• GFC must take seriously its responsibility for academic affairs, and commit to showing leadership \non emerging issues and serving as a forum for discussing and taking decisions in the interest of \nacademic freedom, and excellence in research, creativity, and teaching and learning. \n• While the standing Committees of GFC should have real power to make (or initiate) substantive \ndecisions, a commitment to regular and reciprocal communication should position GFC to ensure \nthat its members retain the capacity to bring significant issues to the floor of GFC for debate and \ndecision. Standing Committee chairs have a responsibility to identify issues that Standing \nCommittee members feel are deserving of discussion by full GFC. \n• The composition of GFC Standing Committees should reflect the principle of meaningful \nrepresentation of elected, appointed, and ex officio, and student, staff, and faculty membership. \n• While ensuring appropriate checks and balances are in place, appropriate consultations occur, and \ncompeting interests are always considered, GFC’s committee structure and decision making \nprocesses should be designed to ensure streamlined pathways for the consideration and, when \ndesired, approval of proposals flowing from Faculties and other units within the University. \n• Meetings of GFC must be conducted in a manner that encourages participation and engagement.  \n• Members of GFC, whether they are elected, appointed, or ex officio, student, staff, or faculty, \nshould be encouraged to represent the interests of any ‘constituency’ with which they are affiliated, \nwhile also considering competing interests and striving to consider (and define) the broader \ninstitutional interest. \nThis overview of the ad hoc committee’s guiding principles is, in many ways, incomplete, but it reflects our \nstarting point for considering the many issues before us. \nItem No. 5 \nGFC EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE \nFor the Meeting of October 31, 2016 \nOUTLINE OF ISSUE \nAdvice, Discussion, Information Item  \nAgenda Title: General Appeals Committee (GAC) Annual Report to General Faculties Council (July 1, \n2015 – June 30, 2016) \nItem   \nProposed by David Johnson, Special Advisor, Faculty and Staff Relations \nPresenter David Johnson, Special Advisor, Faculty and Staff Relations \nDetails \nResponsibility Provost and Vice-President (Academic) \nThe Purpose of the item is \n(please be specific) \nTo comply with GFC-legislated reporting requirements \nTimeline/Implementation Date N/A \nSupplementary Notes and \ncontext \nN/A \nEngagement and Routing (Include meeting dates) \nParticipation: \n(parties who have seen the \nproposal and in what capacity) \n<For further information see \nthe link posted on \nthe Governance Toolkit section \nStudent Participation Protocol> \nThose who have been informed: \n• GFC Executive Committee – October 31, 2016 \n• General Faculties Council – November 21, 2016 \nThose who have been consulted: \n• N/A \nThose who are actively participating: \n• N/A \nAlignment/Compliance \nAlignment with Guiding \nDocuments \nFor the Public Good  \nGOAL:  EXCEL as individuals, and together, sustain a culture that \nfosters and champions distinction and distinctiveness in teaching, \nlearning, research, and service. \nCompliance with Legislation, \nPolicy and/or Procedure \nRelevant to the Proposal \n(please quote legislation and \ninclude identifying section \nnumbers) \n1.

As in past years, we’ve seen a continued acceptance of \nRestorative Justice as simply “the way we address conduct” as opposed to a unique and novel \nconcept that students struggle with. That being said, this past year highlighted the necessity of \ncontinued training on how to functionally use Restorative Justice in a residence community to \nensure consistent application of RJ principles across our residence halls, including to address \nbehavior previously thought to be the realm of the Residence Agreement.\nWhile in previous years we struggled to generate consistent data due to a changeover in our \nHousing Management system, this year’s data was captured with the same methodology as seen \nin the 2014/2015 Annual Report. Unfortunately, in July of 2016 our Housing Management \nSystem provider announced they would be discontinuing support for the Judicial management \nmodule in which we compile these statistics. While that does not impact this year’s data, it may \ncause challenges for future reports. However, we continue to work with our Housing \nManagement System provider to ensure our ability to report on our discipline statistics goes \nunchanged. \nAs with last year, we tracked our judicial statistics on two criteria: Violations, and Sanctions. \nThis allows us to more accurately reflect restorative principles in our judicial statistics. A key \nfactor of restorative justice is that it does not focus on a ‘rule’ that was broken; instead it focuses \non the harms that come from a person’s actions. Accordingly, violations are based on the \nbehaviour of the student that causes harm. \nSanctions are the results of those violations. In many cases, a single restorative sanction can \naddress the harms of several violations (for example, an apology to an entire community may be \nsufficient to address multiple harms caused).\nIn 2015/2016, we had 1,064 unique incidents. This represents a 25% increase over last year’s \nnumber (851 unique incidents); this increase is largely due to increased use of Restorative Justice \non East Campus to manage a wider range of cleanliness and operational issues. In the past, this \ntype of student behavior was almost exclusively handled through our Operations unit but in \nkeeping with our stated position that Restorative Justice is our preferred method of dealing with \nstudent conduct, training on Restorative Justice was extended to our Assignment Coordinators \nand Unit Coordinators. As such, a significant number of incidents were dealt with via Restorative \nJustice. Using restorative justice for cleanliness issues is a new practice for us and we expect \ncontinued growth in its utilization in the future. \nThese incidents resulted in 1210 violations. Those violations were resolved using 668 sanctions, \nof which 83% were Restorative solutions (Community Resolutions, Apology Letters, \nBehavioural Agreements, or Restorative Agreements). This is a slight reduction from last year’s \nfigure of 87%, but given the greater emphasis on Cleaning and Operations issues being dealt \nwith through Restorative Justice, this drop is quite minor.\nIn 2014/2015, Lister Centre accounted for the majority of our conduct with 66% of our total \nincidents originating in Kelsey, Mackenzie, Henday, or Schäffer Hall. However, with the use of \nRestorative Justice for cleanliness issues in 2015/2016, the divide was right down the middle \nwith exactly 50% of our conduct cases in each portfolio. \nLast year’s report highlighted that we saw only 23% of total incidents directly related to alcohol, \nwhich was a 30% improvement over the year before. This year, that trend of improvement has \ncontinued with only 13% of total incidents directly related to alcohol. This trend of improvement \ncan likely be attributed to a change in the cultural of alcohol use in Lister center over the past \nseveral years, such as limited alcohol-related events and preventing consumption in public \nspaces.\nIn last year’s report we began collecting the frequency with which students of concern were \nmanaged by our staff, and discovered that from October (when we started tracking) through to \nMay of 2015, we had approximately 70 students at risk incidents (56 unique students). We \ntracked this figure again, and from May of 2015 to August of 2016 we found we had a marked \nincrease to 172 students of concern that came to our attention, with 126 unique cases.\nSanctions Issued:\nAlc\noh\nol \nPr\nob\nati\non\nAp\nolo\ngy\n Le\ntte\nr\nBe\nha\nvio\nral\n P\nrob\nati\non\nBe\nha\nvio\nura\nl A\ngre\nem\nen\nt\nCl\nea\nnin\ng C\nha\nrge\nCl\nea\nnin\ng R\nes\ntitu\ntio\nn\nCo\nmm\nun\nity\n R\nes\nolu\ntio\nn\nDa\nma\nge\n C\nha\nrge\nDa\nma\nge\ns R\nes\ntitu\ntio\nn\nEv\nict\nion\nNo\n S\nan\ncti\non\n - N\not \nRe\nsp\non\nsib\nle\nNo\nne\n S\npe\ncif\nied\nVis\nitin\ng R\nes\ntric\ntio\nn-50\n50\n150\n250\n350\n450\n550\n650\n3\n71 66\n104\n15 11\n366\n3 4 13\n116\n612\n12\nSanctions Issued May 2015 to August 2016\nNote: None Specified = No Responsible Student Identified;

In this manner the \nUniversity demonstrates its commitment to \nimproving the representativeness of its \ncommunities. \nThe Alberta Human Rights Act, sections \n3 and 11.1, requires that no individual be \ndiscriminated against on the basis of race, \nreligious beliefs, color, gender, physical \ndisability, mental disability, marital status, \nage, ancestry, or place of origin, family status, \nor source of income except where \nthe discrimination can be shown to be \nreasonable and justifiable. The University of \nAlberta recognizes and accepts its \nresponsibility to comply with the requirements \nof this Act in its consideration of students for \nadmission, promotion, and graduation. Of its \nown volition the University of Alberta does not \ndiscriminate on the basis of sexual orientation \nor political belief. \nSubject to the limits set out in the \nAlberta Human Rights Act, the University of \nAlberta affirms its right to determine the \ncriteria by which applicants are accepted into \nthe University community. Individuals seeking \nadmission to or continuance in academic \nprograms must meet the qualifications and \nperformance standards set out by the \nUniversity Equity Statement in Student \nAffairs \nThe University recognizes the diversity of the \nCanadian population and obligation to be \naccessible to all sectors of society. The \nUniversity therefore encourages diversity and \nwelcomes applications from all qualified \npersons including women, members of visible \nminorities, First Nations, Métis, and Inuit, \npersons with disabilities, and sexual and \ngender minorities. The University Calendar \nwill use gender inclusive language when \nreferring to members of the University \nCommunity. This demonstrates the \nUniversity’s commitment to accommodating \nand improving the representativeness of \nits diverse communities. \nThe Alberta Human Rights Act, prohibits \ndiscrimination against any person because \nof race, religious beliefs, colour, \ngender, gender identity, gender expression, \nphysical disability, mental disability, ancestry, \nplace of origin, marital status, source of \nincome, family status or sexual \norientation, except where the distinction can \nbe shown to be reasonable and justifiable in \nthe circumstances. The University of \nAlberta complies with the Act when it \nconsiders students for admission, promotion, \nand graduation. Of its own volition, the \nUniversity of Alberta does not discriminate on \nthe basis of political belief.  \nSubject to the limits set out in the Alberta \nHuman Rights Act, the University of Alberta \naffirms its right to determine the criteria by \nwhich applicants are accepted into the \nUniversity community.
