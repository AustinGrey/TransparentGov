Authority \nThe Post-Secondary Learning Act gives General Faculties Council (GFC) responsibility, subject \nto the authority of the Board of Governors, over \"academic affairs\" (section 26(1)), and provides \nthat GFC may make recommendations to the Board of Governors on a \"building program\" \n(section 26(1)(o)). Section 19 requires that the Board of Governors “consider the \nrecommendations of the general faculties council, if any, on matters of academic import prior to \nproviding for (a) the support and maintenance of the university, (b) the betterment of existing \nbuildings, (c) the construction of any new buildings the board considers necessary to the \npurposes of the university.”  GFC has thus established a Facilities Development Committee \n(FDC), as set out below. Subject to the authority of the Board of Governors, GFC delegates \ncertain of its powers to its Facilities Development Committee.  \nThe complete wording of the section(s) of the Post-Secondary Learning Act, as referred to, \nshould be checked in any instance where formal jurisdiction needs to be determined. \n2. Composition of the Committee \nChair - Provost and Vice-President (Academic) or Delegate (Ex Officio Member) \nNote Regarding the Vice-Chair – The Vice-Chair will be appointed by the GFC Executive \nCommittee from among the faculty members on FDC. \nEx Officio (see above): \nStudents' Union Vice-President (Academic) or Delegate \nGraduate Students' Association Vice-President (Academic) or Delegate \nVice-President (Facilities and Operations) or Delegate (EXEC 03 FEB 2003) \nMembers Elected by GFC \nFive members from Category A1.0*, plus one cross-representative appointed by the Chair of \nAPC from that committee.  There shall be no more than one representative from any Faculty \n(except for the cross-representative).   \nOne member of the support staff (Categories S1.0 and S2.0*), elected by GFC \nOne undergraduate student (EXEC 14 JUN 2004) \nNon-voting members: \nDirector of Engineering Infrastructure or Delegate  \nUniversity Architect or Delegate \nAssociate Vice-President (Facilities and Operations) \nVice-Provost and University Registrar or Delegate (EXEC 23 JUN 2003) \n* See UAPPOL Recruitment Policy (Appendix A) Definition and Categories of Academic Staff \nand Colleagues and (Appendix B) Definition and Categories of Support Staff for definitions of \nthese categories of staff. \n3.

Delegation of Authority \nNotwithstanding anything to the contrary in the terms of reference above, the Board of \nGovernors and General Faculties Council have delegated to the Facilities Development \nCommittee the following powers and authority: \nA.    Facilities \n1.  To approve proposed General Space Programmes (Programs) for academic units. \n2.     (i)  To approve proposals concerning the design and use of all new facilities and the \nrepurposing of existing facilities and to routinely report these decisions for \ninformation to the Board of Governors.   \n(ii)  In considering such proposals, GFC FDC may provide advice, upon request, to \nthe Provost and Vice-President (Academic), Vice-President (Facilities and \nOperations), and/or the University Architect (or their respective delegates) on the \nsiting of such facilities.  (GFC SEP 29 2003) \nB.  Other Matters \nThe Chair of FDC will bring forward to FDC items where the Office of the Provost and \nVice-President (Academic) and/or the Office of the Vice-President (Facilities and \nOperations), in consultation with other units or officers of the University, is seeking the \nadvice of the Committee.  \nC.

It is difficult to accurately represent in an organizational chart the manner in which business flows through the University of Alberta’s academic governance system. For that reason, those \ninterested in learning more are referred to the appropriate source documents, including the Post-Secondary Learning Act, GFC’s Terms of Reference, the General Terms of Reference for GFC\nStanding Committees, and the individual GFC Standing Committee Terms of Reference for details on roles/responsibilities and delegations of authority.\n2. The GFC Executive Committee has been distinguished in this chart given its central role in setting the Agendas for all GFC meetings.  That said, not all academic business flows up to and is\nconsidered by GFC; in some instances, certain GFC Standing Committees have delegated authority to make final decisions or to recommend directly to the Board of Governors..\n3. The GFC Replenishment Committee’s sole function is to replenish the GFC Executive Committee (which functions, too, as GFC’s Nominating Committee).  As such, nominee slates go directly \nfrom GFC RC to GFC.\nItem 5 - Attachment 3\nPage 1 of 8 \nGFC STANDING COMMITTEE DESCRIPTIONS  \nThe Post-Secondary Learning Act (PSLA) gives General Faculties Council (GFC) responsibility, subject to the \nauthority of the Board of Governors, over \"academic affairs\" (section 26(1)). To carry out its responsibilities, \nGFC has established standing committees and appeal boards and has enacted policies governing the \nreplenishment and operation of those groups.  Full terms of reference for the following committees can be found \non line on the University Governance website (www.ualberta.ca/governance ).   \nGFC has nine (9) standing committees and three (3) appeal boards supported by University Governance. \nStanding Committees \n• GFC Academic Planning Committee (APC \n• GFC Academic Standards Committee (ASC)  \n• GFC Committee On The Learning Environment (CLE)  \n• GFC Campus Law Review Committee (CLRC)  \n• GFC Executive Committee (GFC EXEC) And GFC Nominating Committee (GFC NC) \n• GFC Facilities Development Committee (FDC)  \n• GFC Replenishment Committee \n• GFC Undergraduate Awards And Scholarship Committee (UASC)  \n• GFC University Teaching Awards Committee (UTAC)  \nAppeal Boards \n• GFC Academic Appeals Committee (AAC)  \n• University Appeal Board (UAB) \n• GFC Practice Review Board (PRB) \nGFC ACADEMIC PLANNING COMMITTEE (APC) \n• The GFC Academic Planning Committee (APC) is the senior standing committee of General Faculties \nCouncil (GFC).
