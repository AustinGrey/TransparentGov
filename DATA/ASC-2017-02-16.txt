UAPPOL Admissions Policy: “Admission to the University of Alberta \nis based on documented academic criteria established by individual \nFaculties and approved by GFC. This criteria may be defined in areas \nsuch as subject requirements, minimum entrance averages, and \nlanguage proficiency requirements. In addition to academic requirements \nfor admission, GFC authorizes each Faculty to establish such other \nreasonable criteria for admission of applicants as the Faculty may \nconsider appropriate to its programs of study, subject to the approval of \nGFC (e.g. interview, audition, portfolio, etc.) \nThe admission requirements for any Faculty will be those approved by \nGFC as set forth in the current edition of the University Calendar. In \naddition to the admission requirements, selection criteria for quota \nprograms, where they exist, will also be published in the current edition \nof the University Calendar. \nThe responsibility for admission decisions will be vested in the Faculty \nAdmission Committees or in the Deans of the respective Faculties, as \nthe councils of such Faculties will determine.” \n4.  UAPPOL Admissions Procedure: \n“PROCEDURE \nItem 3 - page 3\nItem No. 4A - C \nGFC ACADEMIC STANDARDS COMMITTEE \nFor the Meeting of February 16, 2017 \n1. EFFECTIVE DATE OF CHANGES TO ADMISSION REGULATIONS \nFollowing approval by GFC: \na. Where changes to admission regulations may disadvantage students \nin the current admission cycle, normally implementation will be effective \nafter the change has been published in the University Calendar for one \nfull year (i.e., effective the second year that the information is published \nin the University Calendar). \nFor example, a change approved in May 2005 would be first published in \nthe 2006-2007 University Calendar in March 2006. Therefore the \nstatement cannot come into effect until September 2007 (affecting \napplicants who apply for the September 2007 term beginning July \n2006).” \nb. Where changes to admission regulations are deemed by the \napproving body to be ‘advantageous to students’, normally the date of \nimplementation will be effective immediately or at the next available \nintake for the admitting Faculty.” \n5.  PSLA: The PSLA gives Faculty Councils the authority to “determine \nthe conditions under which a student must withdraw from or may \ncontinue the student’s program of studies in a faculty” (Section 29(1)(d)). \n6. UAPPOL Academic Standing Policy:  “All current academic \nstanding regulations, including academic standing categories, University \ngraduating standards and requirements for all individual programs will be \nthose prescribed by Faculty Councils and GFC as set forth in the \nUniversity Calendar.” \n7. UAPPOL Academic Standing Regulations Procedures: “All \nproposed new academic standing regulations and changes to existing \nacademic standing regulations will be submitted by the Faculties or the \nAdministration to the Provost and Vice-President (Academic). Faculties \nwill also submit to the Provost and Vice-President (Academic) any \nproposed changes to the use and/or computation of averages relating to \nacademic standing, including promotion and graduation. \nIf the Provost and Vice-President (Academic) determines the proposal to \nbe in good order, the proposal will be introduced to the appropriate \nUniversity governance process(es). In considering these proposals, \ngovernance bodies will consult as necessary with the Faculties and with \nother individuals and offices. \nNormally, changes become effective once they are approved by GFC or \nits delegate and are published in the University Calendar.” \nAttachments  \n1.

UAPPOL Admissions Procedure: \n“PROCEDURE \n1. EFFECTIVE DATE OF CHANGES TO ADMISSION REGULATIONS \nFollowing approval by GFC: a. Where changes to admission regulations \nmay disadvantage students in the current admission cycle, normally \nimplementation will be effective after the change has been published in \nthe University Calendar for one full year (i.e., effective the second year \nthat the information is published in the University Calendar). For \nexample, a change approved in May 2005 would be first published in the \n2006-2007 University Calendar in March 2006. Therefore the statement \ncannot come into effect until September 2007 (affecting applicants who \napply for the September 2007 term beginning July 2006).” \n5. GFC Academic Standards Committee (ASC) Terms of Reference \n(Mandate): The Office of the Provost and Vice- President (Academic) \nhas determined that the proposed changes are editorial in nature.  \n“A.

Rationale for suspension (for example, changes in applications, enrolment, employer \ndemand, program obsolescence, etc.).  Comment on the alignment of the proposed change \nwith the institution’s strategic direction and priorities.  If enrolment is a key rationale, \nprovide historical enrolment data. \nThe program has been low demand.  Enrollment for the last four years is as follows: \n2011-12 2012-13 2013-14 2014-15 2015-16 2016-17 \n24 21 19 24 16 12 \nThe administrative complexity of fulfilling both degree requirements has made the program \ndifficult for students to complete without significant advising.  Additional difficulties exist \nfor students transferring into the Combined Degree from other post-secondary institutions \nsince the Teacher Qualification Services (through the Alberta Teachers Association) does \nnot recognize non-ACAT transfer credit granted for the Human Ecology portion of the \nCombined Degree.  Recently, the Faculty of ALES completed a review of all of its \nundergraduate programs.  For the reasons outlined above, the ALES Undergraduate \nPrograms Review Task Force recommended that the Combined Degree be suspended. \nSubsequent consultation with the Department of Human Ecology and the Faculty of \nEducation resulted in agreement to suspend the program. \nThe Faculties of ALES and Education agree that interested students would be better served \nby completing a BSc in Human Ecology followed by an after degree in Education.  \nRecruiters for both Faculties will make prospective students aware of this option. Students \ninterested in this area also have the option of pursuing a regular BEd program with a major \nor minor in CTS: Human Sciences. \n2. Anticipated impacts on students and graduates and plans to ameliorate these impacts.  \nDescribe the institution’s plan to teach out active students and stop-outs.  Include evidence \nof consultation with students and a communications plan for informing stopped-out \nstudents of the change. \nAs there are no courses that are specific to the Combined Degree, there will be no direct \nimpacts on students currently in the program.  All students who are currently enrolled in \nthe program will be allowed to complete their program within 8 years of admission (as per \nUniversity policy). \nItem 5 - page 4\nStudents who stop out will be allowed to return to the Combined Degree program as long \nas they are able to complete the degree requirements by June 2025.  All students who are \ncurrently stopped out will be sent an email and a letter to their last known contact address \ninforming them of the changes. \nThe Faculties consulted with the Education Students Association and the Human Ecology \nStudents Association.  Both understood the need for the suspension and the benefits of the \nalternative streams for prospective students interested in pursuing similar studies. \n3. Identify anticipated impacts on external stakeholders (e.g. employers, professional/ \nregulatory organizations, other post-secondary institutions) and provide evidence of \nconsultation. \nGiven the small number of graduates, there will be no impact on external stakeholders.  \nThere are no specific teaching positions tied to this degree program.  Students will be able \nto satisfy stakeholder needs by selecting appropriate courses within a BEd degree program, \nor by completing a BSc in Human Ecology followed by a BEd after degree.  The Faculty of \nEducation contacted the Alberta Ministry of Education to ask if they had concerns \nregarding the suspension; none were identified. \n4. Identify anticipated impacts on institutional operations and resources (e.g. operating \nbudget, staffing, student services, information technology, library, classroom and lab \nspace).  Discuss plans for the reallocation of any resources freed up by the proposed \nsuspension.   \nThere are no teaching resources allocated to this program specifically, as all courses are \noffered as part of the traditional BSc Human Ecology and the BEd Secondary degree \nprograms respectively.  Student advising resources will be freed up by the suspension, \nwhich can be reapportioned to better serve other students. \nB:  Reactivation \n1. Rationale for reactivation (for example, increased employer demand, student demand, new \nfunding sources, etc.).  Comment on the alignment of the proposed change with the \ninstitution’s strategic direction and priorities. \n2. Identify anticipated impacts on institutional operations and resources (e.g. operating \nbudget, staffing, student services, information technology, library, and classroom and lab \nspace). \n3. Provide a simplified enrolment plan using the following table.  Include assumptions and \nexplanatory notes (e.g., attrition, part-time enrolment). \nProposed Enrolment Year 1 Year 2 Year 3 Year 4 Year 5 Annual Ongoing \nIntake (head count) 0 0 0 0 0 0 \nTotal head count 0 0 0 0 0 0 \nTotal FLE 0 0 0 0 0 0 \nAnticipated No. of Graduates 0 0 0 0 0 0 \nItem 5 - page 5\nC:  Termination \n1. Describe measures taken by the institution to ensure that active students and stop-outs have \nhad ample opportunity to complete their programs of study. \n2. Where applicable, summarize the actual re-allocation of resources during the period of \nsuspension, and any additional re-allocation anticipated upon termination, and specify the \nimpacts of re-allocation on institutional operations.   \nItem 5 - page 6\nCurrent (2016/17) Calendar Entry Proposed (2017/18) Calendar Entry \nBSc in Human Ecology/BEd (Secondary) \nCombined Degrees [ALES] \nGeneral Information \n(See also Bachelor of Science in Human \nEcology/Bachelor of Education (Secondary) \nCombined Degrees and BSc in Human \nEcology/BEd (Secondary) Combined Degrees \n[Education]) \nThe Bachelor of Science in Human \nEcology/Bachelor of Education (Secondary) \nCombined Degrees program provides a five-\nyear integrated program of ★150 that prepares \ngraduates for teaching CTS strands such as \nFoods and Fashion Studies. Coursework within \nthe two Faculties is taken concurrently. \nStudents initially apply for admission to the \nFaculty of Agricultural, Life and Environmental \nSciences and are considered to be registered in \nthat Faculty for the first three years of the \nprogram. All qualified Year 3 BSc in Human \nEcology/Bachelor of Education students will be \npromoted to Year 4 in the Faculty of Education \nprovided a minimum GPA of 2.0 has been \nachieved and a minimum of ★90 applicable to \nthe BSc in Human Ecology/BEd (Secondary) \nDegrees program has been successfully \ncompleted. See Bachelor of Science in Human \nEcology/Bachelor of Education (Secondary) \nCombined Degrees for detailed admission \nrequirements and procedures for entry to Year \n4 of this Combined Degrees Program. \nNotes \n1.

This certificate will also be available \nto students in other graduate degrees in the SPH, as well as other faculties. \nEmployment \nHaving the Certificate in Communicable Diseases will be an advantage for students \nseeking positions involving communicable disease research and/or control as it will \nmake explicit their education in the field. \nFurther Education Options \nHaving the Certificate in Communicable Diseases will be an advantage for students \nin our targeted student population seeking entrance into PhD programs in \ncommunicable disease research. It will make explicit their background in the field.  \nSection B: Rationale, Implications and Impact  \nRationale for Introduction of \nCertificate \nOutline the rationale for the \nproposed embedded credit \ncertificate and provide supporting \ndata if applicable – eg. Results of \nstudent or economic demand \nanalyses; consultation with wider \ncommunity, etc.   \n Currently, the University of Alberta does not offer a non-laboratory Master’s level \ncertificate in communicable diseases. Consultations have taken place with faculty in \nthe SPH and in the Divisions of Infectious Disease, and Preventive Medicine, in the \nDepartment of Medicine, Faculty of Medicine and Dentistry (FOMD), and with \nAlberta Health staff, regarding the need for a certificate. Letters of support from the \nVice Deans of Research and Education, and the Associate Dean, Research, \nGraduate Programs from the FoMD, as well as the Chair of the Department of \nMedical Microbiology and Immunology are attached in Appendix B. We have also \nconsulted Alberta Health and the Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC), as \npotential employers regarding the need for a certificate and appropriateness for \nemployment.  \nWe currently offer 8 different specializations in our MSc program, including a  \nspecialization in General Public Health beginning in 2015/6. Embedding a \nCertificate in Communicable Diseases in the MSc degree will ensure students \nacquire broad expertise in communicable diseases. We also expect interest from \nstudents in the MSc degrees in Global Health and Epidemiology specializations. \nThis certificate will allow us to assess the demand for Master’s level training in \ncommunicable diseases and also allow us to test the appropriateness of the courses.  \nWe also expect students enrolled in MSc programs in the FOMD might be \ninterested in the Certificate in Communicable Diseases.  \n† SPH 561 “Topics in Public Health” used for each “topic” until courses are approved for their own number. \nItem 6 - page 6\n3 \nRevised: February 2, 2017 \nThe certificate is important, in part, because of the current public health relevance \nand awareness of communicable diseases among the general public, as well \nevidence of increased student interest as the number of students registering in the \nSPH 697 Epidemiology and Control of Infectious Diseases course has increased to a \nmaximum of 25 per course over the past 10 years. Current enrollment in the \n2016/17 academic year:  SPH 696 (15); SPH 697 (11); SPH 561 (*1) Topics in \nPublic Health: HIV: a Public Health Perspective (11); SPH 561 (*1) Topics in \nPublic Health: Malaria (3); SPH 561 (*1) Topics in Public Health: Vaccine-\nPreventable Diseases and Immunization Programs (11). \nVision and Academic Plan \nHow does the proposed program \nconnect to the University’s vision \nFor the Public Good? How does \nthe program further the University’s \nAcademic Plan?  \nThis proposal supports the emphasis of the university vision For the Public Good \nthrough: \nExperience: Objective 8.  Create and facilitate co-curricular learning experiences \nfor undergraduate and graduate students that enable their self-discovery and give \nthem the skills to use their talents, creativity and curiosity to contribute as future \ncitizens and leaders.  \nEngagement: Objective 17.  Facilitate, build and support interdisciplinary, cross-\nfaculty and cross-unit engagement and collaboration.  \nWe anticipate students from multiple backgrounds will apply for this certificate. \nBecause of our links with the practice community we are able to offer a certificate \nprogram that is rich not only in fostering scholarship and discovery but also in \npractical application for policy and practice.  \nResource Implications \nIdentify the resource implications \nof the proposed embedded credit \ncertificate.

The proposed \nincreases are to ensure that NCA students have sufficient English \nproficiency to be successful in class. The proposed changes were \napproved by the Law Faculty Council on November 8, 2016. Proposed \nRequirements are as follows: - TOEFL: Minimum score of 600 (paper-\nbased) or a total score of 100 with a score of at least 25 on each of the \nindividual skills areas (internet-based) - IELTS (Academic): Minimum \noverall band score of 7.0 with at least 5 on each band - PTE (Academic): \noverall minimum score of 68 - EAP 550 course through the Faculty of \nExtension \nThe Impact of the Proposal is NCA Special Students applying in future years would be required to \nachieve higher standards of English proficiency. It is anticipated that \nthese new requirements will increase the likelihood of student success \nwithin the program. As NCA students are paying a substantial tuition \ncost, we would like to do what we can to ensure that they can \nsuccessfully complete the program. With the improvements, it is \nanticipated that professors with special students in their class will have a \nreduced load, as they are will spend less time assisting them with \nlanguage based challenges. \nReplaces/Revises (eg, policies, \nresolutions) \nCurrent admission requirements for special students published in the \nUniversity Calendar \nTimeline/Implementation Date For publication in the 2018/19 calendar to take effect for 2019/20 \nEstimated Cost and funding \nsource \nNext Steps (ie.: \nCommunications Plan, \nImplementation plans) \n• Update the Faculty of Law website to include current English \nLanguage Proficiency requirements as well as upcoming changes.    \n• Communicate the current requirements as well as the upcoming \nchanges to potential students via phone and email inquiries.  \nSupplementary Notes and \ncontext \nEngagement and Routing (Include meeting dates) \nItem 7 - page 1\nItem No. 7 \nGFC ACADEMIC STANDARDS COMMITTEE \nFor the Meeting of February 16, 2017 \nParticipation: \n(parties who have seen the \nproposal and in what capacity) \n<For further information see \nthe link posted on \nthe Governance Toolkit section \nStudent Participation Protocol> \nThose who have been informed: \n• Dean Paton has been informed of the desired increase to ELP \nrequirements.

This includes making decisions with regard to the structures, policies, and practices of decision-\nmaking, the exercise of authority, and the mechanisms of accountability.   \nUniversity governance is multi-level and bicameral. Provincial legislation – the Post-Secondary Learning \nAct (PSLA) – sets the framework for university governance. At the institutional level, the PSLA prescribes \nthat UAlberta will have bicameral institutions of governance – that is, there are two governing bodies. The \nBoard of Governors (the Board) oversees the business affairs of the institution – from appointing the \nPresident, through to approving budgets, investment strategies, collective agreements, and long-range \nstrategic planning. The General Faculties Council (GFC) oversees ‘academic affairs’. \nTo understand the operations of the university, it is important to note the distinction between ‘governance’ \nand ‘administration’. While the Board and GFC set policies and establish broad directions for the institution, \nthe university’s senior executive team is responsible for administrative operations, including operational \npolicies and decisions. And this is replicated at the Faculty and Departmental levels across the university.  \nGood governance requires collegial practice at all levels including the Board, the executive and all \nmembers of the institution.  \nThis ad hoc committee’s mandate pertains to reviewing academic governance at the institutional level. \nThus, we are to remain focused on the operations of GFC and its standing committees (including the \ndelegation of authority from GFC, the mandate and structure of committees, and related matters). \nBut, as a matter of principle, we embrace a reasonably expansive understanding of ‘academic affairs’ and, \nthus, GFC’s mandate. We support the notion that GFC must have the capacity to defend its legitimate role \nwith regard to issues that exist at the boundary between governance and administration, as well as \nbetween Board and GFC responsibilities. We also support the notion that GFC should have early \nopportunities to influence strategic decisions and directions that are set by the Board or administration, but \nimpinge on academic affairs. \nGuiding Principles \nAs a committee, we are committed to the principles of ‘collegial academic governance’. These principles \ninclude: \n• A desire to build mutual understanding of common goals and shared purpose – operationalized in \nnumerous ways, including the adoption of an institutional strategic plan. \n• A commitment to inclusive and participatory governance decision-making.  \n• A desire to facilitate meaningful individual-level engagement in governance processes. \n• A commitment to openness, transparency, and respectful communication.  \n• A commitment to responsiveness, respect, and reciprocity between governing bodies and between \ngoverning bodies and university administration.  \nItem 8 - page 8\nAd Hoc Committee on Academic Governance including Delegated Authority \nGuiding Principles \n2 \nFurther Guiding Elements \nGuided by these principles, we begin our deliberations in agreement on the following: \n• GFC must take seriously its responsibility for academic affairs, and commit to showing leadership\non emerging issues and serving as a forum for discussing and taking decisions in the interest of\nacademic freedom, and excellence in research, creativity, and teaching and learning.\n• While the standing Committees of GFC should have real power to make (or initiate) substantive\ndecisions, a commitment to regular and reciprocal communication should position GFC to ensure\nthat its members retain the capacity to bring significant issues to the floor of GFC for debate and\ndecision. Standing Committee chairs have a responsibility to identify issues that Standing\nCommittee members feel are deserving of discussion by full GFC.\n• The composition of GFC Standing Committees should reflect the principle of meaningful\nrepresentation of elected, appointed, and ex officio, and student, staff, and faculty membership.\n• While ensuring appropriate checks and balances are in place, appropriate consultations occur, and\ncompeting interests are always considered, GFC’s committee structure and decision making\nprocesses should be designed to ensure streamlined pathways for the consideration and, when\ndesired, approval of proposals flowing from Faculties and other units within the University.\n• Meetings of GFC must be conducted in a manner that encourages participation and engagement.\n• Members of GFC, whether they are elected, appointed, or ex officio, student, staff, or faculty,\nshould be encouraged to represent the interests of any ‘constituency’ with which they are affiliated,\nwhile also considering competing interests and striving to consider (and define) the broader\ninstitutional interest.\nThis overview of the ad hoc committee’s guiding principles is, in many ways, incomplete, but it reflects our \nstarting point for considering the many issues before us. \nEndorsed by General Faculties Council: \nNovember 21, 2016\nItem 8 - page 9\n\tItem-1-Agenda-ASC-FE-16\n\tItem-4-Omnibus\n\tItem-4-Omnibus-Motion-Items-A-C\n\t4A-2017 01 Proposed Approvals\n\t4B-2017 02 Proposed Approvals\n\t4C-ALES-Admission-deadlines\n\tItem-5-BHEcol-BEd-suspension\n\t5-BHEcol-BEd-suspension\n\tAtt-1-HECOL BEd Combined Degree Proposed Suspension Feb 2017\n\tProposed (2017/18) Calendar Entry\n\tItem-6-Cert-Communicable-Diseases-SPH\n\t6-SPH Grad Cert Commncbl Diseases\n\tAtt 1 - SPH Grad Cert Commncbl Diseases\n\tItem-7-Law-admission-Special-Students\n\t5-Law-Admission-Special-Student - UPDATED\n\tAtt 1 Calendar Entry for Juris Doctor (JD)-General Admission Requirements-Special Student Applicants\n\tItem-8-ToR\n\t8-OI - ToR Week\n\t8-Att-1-Academic-Standards-Committee-ToR\n\t8-Att-2-Ad Hoc Guiding Principles-endorsed by GFC\n",
