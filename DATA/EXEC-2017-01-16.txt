GFC Policy: The Helping Individuals at Risk and Safe Disclosure and \nHuman Rights Annual Report is one of several reports from non-GFC \ncommittees/entities requested to provide an annual report to GFC.  \n3. GFC Terms of Reference (GFC Procedures/GFC Agendas/ \nReports):  “Reports not requiring action by GFC will be discussed by the \nExecutive Committee (with committee chairs in attendance) and placed \non the GFC agenda for information. If a GFC member has a question \nabout a report, or feels that the report should be discussed by GFC, the \nGFC member should notify the Secretary to GFC, in writing, two \nbusiness days or more before GFC meets so that the committee chair \ncan be invited to attend. Such reports will be discussed as the last of the \nstanding items.” (Section 4.a.) \nAnnual reports are made available to GFC online. \n4. BSHEC Terms of Reference:  \nMandate of the Committee: \n“Except as provided in paragraph 4 hereof and in the Board’s General \nCommittee Terms of Reference, the Committee shall monitor, evaluate, \nadvise and make decisions on behalf of the Board with respect to all \nmatters concerning environmental health and the protection of the \nhealth, safety and security of the University community and the general \npublic at the University as well as University student health and \nwellness.” \n5.

Attachment 1: Office of Safe Disclosure and Human Rights (OSDHR) Annual Report 2015-16 \nPrepared by:  Sarah Flower, Advisor (Safe Disclosure and Human Rights), sarah.flower@ualberta.ca \nmailto:Sarah\nOffice of Safe Disclosure and  \nHuman Rights (OSDHR) \nAnnual Report 2015-16 \nProgram Goals \nThe Office of Safe Disclosure & Human Rights (OSDHR) has two functions: the provision of \nthe University of Alberta’s confidential disclosure services; and human rights promotion \nand consulting.  The office provides intake, advisory and educational services to students, \nstaff and faculty at all University of Alberta campuses.  \nIn addition, OSDHR supports and manages the Helping Individuals at Risk (HIAR) program, \nwhich reports separately.  \nThis report spans the period of July 1, 2015 - June 30th, 2016. \nDisclosure Activity \nOSDHR operates on a confidential intake and referral model.  Individuals or groups that \nmake disclosures to the office are referred to the most appropriate university service \nprovider(s) in order for the matter to be addressed.    \nThe OSDHR launched an online reporting tool that allows reports to be securely submitted \nvia the web.  This augments the existing reporting mechanisms and enhances the office’s \nability to receive reports. \nThe OSDHR provided intake and referral services for 118 disclosures during the reporting \nyear, mostly reported by staff and faculty. The majority of disclosures related to harassment \nand discrimination, but allegations on a wide variety of matters including safety, fraud and \nthe application of collective agreements were disclosed.   \nPublic Interest Disclosure Act (PIDA) Disclosures \n The University Auditor is the university’s Designated Officer under the Public Interest \nDisclosure Act (PIDA); one complaint was made formally under the Act. The OSDHR is \nresponsible meeting the University of Alberta’s obligations under the Public Interest \nDisclosure Act regarding intake and awareness activities. \nReferrals \nMatters reported to the Office are typically referred to existing campus resources for \nresolution. The OSDHR maintains a working relationship with the various resources to \nensure delivery of effective referral services.  \nSummary of Disclosure Activity \nTable 1.

The office also engages in a variety of activities that \nsupport the objectives of the Discrimination, Harassment and Duty to Accommodate Policy \nthat states “The University is enriched by diversity, and it welcomes and seeks to include \nmany voices, including those that have been under-represented or excluded.” Training and \ncoaching activities included 38 in-person training sessions, the development of online \ntraining materials, such as videos, and multiple advisory conversations with members of the \nUniversity community, including senior leadership.  In additional training was delivered at \nnew employee orientation, Gold Leadership College, the supervisory leadership program \nand student orientations. \nThe office also supports various processes and committees, such as scholarship \ndevelopment and GFC sub-committees, by providing advice on human rights policies and \nbest-practices. \nOSDHR collaborates with various campus service providers on projects that promote a \npositive human rights environment and the university, such as Equity Diversity and \nInclusion Week, the Visiting Lectureship in Human Rights and the Understanding Race in \nthe Academy project. \nWhen possible, the office collaborates with community organizations to lend expertise or \nbuild awareness of the University’s commitment to human rights. The OSDHR advisor \ncontributed to activities hosted by the Universal Design Conference, the MS Society of \nNorthern Alberta/NWT and the Edmonton Fringe Festival.   \nAreas of Focus for 2016-2017 \nStudent Engagement \nThe Office has assessed models to encourage student engagement and will be implementing \ninitiatives over the upcoming year to partner further with the student associations. \nImplementation of For the Public Good \nOSDHR will initiate and support activities that support “For the Public Good,” particularly \nthose related to equity. \nUnderstanding Race in the Academy Project \nIn conjunction with Human Resource Services, the office is undertaking a project that will \nengage campus in discussions about how race is experienced at the university. It is intended \nto provide broad guidance to the university on how to identify and address barriers related \nto race. \nPublic Interest Disclosure Act \nThe Select Special Ethics and Accountability Committee of the legislature has recommended \nchanges to the Public Interest Disclosure Act. If passed, these will expand the scope of \ndisclosure responsibilities for the university and the Designated Officer.  \nHelping Individuals at Risk \n(HIAR) \nAnnual Report 2015-16 \nProgram Goals \nHelping Individuals at Risk has the following objectives: \n• to encourage the campus community to “Trust Your Instincts,” to recognize and \nreport worrisome behaviours of those at risk of harm to self or others;  \n• to provide a confidential centralized location for reports of worrisome behaviour \nand to connect situations that would otherwise seem to be isolated incidents, and \nassess the reported behaviours; and  \n• to help connect Individuals at Risk to resources before a situation escalates. \nReports of Individuals at Risk \nThe HIAR program received 531 reports about 338 perceived Individuals at Risk, an \nincrease from the previous year in both the number of reports (26%) and the reported \nnumber of perceived Individuals at Risk (21%). These numbers demonstrate continued \ngrowth of the program, an average of 20% per year. \nFigure 1. Individuals at Risk and total reports by year \nThe majority of reports to the program (71%) continued to be regarding undergraduate \nstudents. Eleven percent were regarding graduate students, 6% were faculty or staff, 4% \nwere in open studies, 4% were about former students, 1% were Post-Doctoral Fellows and \nthe remainder (2%) were other (i.e. applicants, visiting students, or former employees). \nReports about International Students comprised 19% of all reports.  \n102 \n153 168 \n216 \n280 \n338 \n176 \n214 \n281 \n355 \n421 \n531 \n0\n100\n200\n300\n400\n500\n600\n2010-11 2011-12 2012-13 2013-14 2014-15 2015-16\nNumber of\nindividuals at\nrisk\nNumber of\nreports\nFigure 2. Status of Individuals at Risk, 2015-16 \nThe majority of perceived Individuals at Risk reported were male (54%); 44% were female \nand 2% were transgender. Most reports were about a behavioural concern (47%) wherein \nthe perceived Individual at Risk was exhibiting worrisome behaviour that did not yet meet \nthe assessment of harm. Thirty-nine percent of reports were regarding possible harm to \nself, 13% were regarding risk of harm to others, 1% concerned risk of both harm to self and \nothers, 1% concerned bullying, and there was one report about a disruption to the \ncommunity. \nFigure 3. Type of at-risk behaviour, 2015-16 \nThe number of reports about those exhibiting behavioural concerns increased again this \nyear, as did reports regarding academic concerns. HIAR plans to track the number of \nacademic concerns reported to the program next year to determine the number of reports \nreceived that could potentially be managed by other units (Student Services, Faculty or \nDepartment Advisors).  \nReporters of At Risk Behaviour \nThe greatest number of reports came from University of Alberta Protective Services (130 \nreports or 24%), staff members (94 reports or 18%) and instructors (82 reports or 15%).  \nLast year, instructors comprised only 10% of reports made to the program. This significant \nincrease in reports from instructors could be due to concerted effort by the HIAR \nCoordinator to present to faculty and department council meetings. \n378 \n56 \n33 \n22 22 8 12 \nUndergraduate\nGraduate\nFaculty and Staff\nFormer Students\n205 \n248 \n67 \n7 1 3 Harm to Self\nBehaviorual Concern\nHarm to Others\nHarm to Both\nFigure 4. Status of reporter of at-risk behaviour, 2015-16 \nA significant number of reports were also received from Residence Services (76 reports or \n14%), the Office of the Dean of Students/University Student Services (63 reports or 12%) \nand Senior Administrators (52 reports or 10%).  \nThe busiest months for receiving reports of At Risk Behaviour were October 2015 and \nMarch 2016.  Reports in December were high despite the Christmas closure. \nFigure 5. Number of reports by month, 2015-16 \nServices Provided \nMore than one service is often provided to a perceived Individual at Risk and/or the \nreporter, depending on the situation and the level of risk of the individual. Reports received \n“for information purposes”, with no action required, dropped significantly last year, which \nmeans that HIAR staff provided at least one service in 70% of the reports received. The \nmost common services delivered were follow-ups (33%), referrals for the Individual at Risk \n(29%) and referrals to the HIAR Case Team (20%) for assessment and action planning.  \nThere was also an increase (4%) in the percentage of reports in which HIAR staff contacted \nan Individual at Risk directly. \n130 \n94 \n82 \n76 \n63 \n52 \n16 10 5 3 Protective Services\nStaff Members\nInstructors/Professors\nResidence Services\nDean of Students\nSenior Administrators\nStudents\nHuman Resources Staff\nFamily Member\n17 \n24 \n45 \n60 \n54 54 53 54 \n67 \n49 \n28 26 \n0\n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\n60\n70\n80\nJuly\n'15\nAug\n'15\nSept\n'15\nOct\n'15\nNov\n'15\nDec\n'15\n Jan\n'16\nFeb\n'16\nMar\n'16\nApr\n'16\nMay\n'16\nJun\n'16\n2015-16\nTable 1.

A part-time position was added to the \nprogram in October 2015 with a focus on intake and management of reports. The education \nactivities of the past year included: \n• Facilitating 12 presentations about the program and attending two awareness \nbooths \n• Developing an online video about the HIAR program  \n• Participating and providing expertise for the Health and Safety Social Media \ndiscussion, Sexual Violence Policy, the Suicide Prevention Framework and the \nACCESS working group \nThe HIAR web pages were accessed by 1,663 unique visitors, more than double the number \nof unique visitors last year.

A written protocol for information sharing between HIAR and \nUniversity of Alberta Protective Services was developed.  \nThe Vice Provost and Dean of Students initiated a review of HIAR policy to expand the \nprogram to include academic risk and to develop two Case Teams, one for students and one \nfor faculty and staff.

FPG Performance Indicators Advisory Group – membership (1 page) \nPrepared by: Logan Mardhani-Bayne, Initiatives Manager (Audit and Analysis), lmardhan@ualberta.ca \nAs approved by President’s Executive Committee – Strategic (05 Jan. 2017)    \nFor the Public Good (FPG): \nApproved Performance Indicators \nIntroduction \nIn July 2016, the university established an advisory group to recommend a framework for reporting on \nperformance against For the Public Good (FPG). Following an extended consultation process with the university \ncommunity, these performance indicators were approved in January 2017. \nPrinciples for performance indicators: \nIn June 2016, the President’s Executive Committee – Strategic (PEC-S) endorsed the following principles: \n• a focused, manageable framework that blends quantitative and qualitative indicators \n• indicators reflecting outcomes rather than simply activities, where possible \n• integrity and efficiency of data collection \n• relevance of indicators to FPG objectives \n• selection of relevant comparators \n• timely modification of indicators to reflect institutional evolution (NOTE: indicators will be adjusted to \nreflect priorities identified through implementation already underway, e.g. defining  signature areas)  \nReporting contexts: \nThe U of A has two primary reporting contexts, each of which warrants distinct indicators: \n• Government (public) reporting: Comprehensive Institutional Plan (CIP), Annual Report (AR).  \no The CIP and Annual Report are based on provincial guidelines, which recommend that \ninstitutions develop approximately 15 performance measures. These tend to be outcome-\nbased, and should present a comprehensive view of the institution’s core functions.  \n• Internal indicators: administrative and other Board of Governors reports.  \no These tend to be activity-based indicators, indicators for trend identification, and/or faculty-\nlevel information not suitable for overall institutional reporting. \nThe table on page two provides an overview of indicators for each FPG Goal. Indicators may be relevant to \nmultiple FPG Goals, but each is listed only under the area of most direct relevance. The indicators presented \nare intended to form the basis of key public and internal reporting; it is not intended that every indicator will \nbe included in every reporting period. Faculty-level breakdowns can be made available for use by individual \nunits where sufficient data exists.  \nThe remainder of this document presents detailed descriptions of these indicators and existing targets. The \nexamples provided are drawn from existing reports and may not reflect the full scope of each indicator. \nAcronyms: \nNSSE National Survey on Student Engagement - standardized survey administered by over 500 institutions in \nCanada and the U.S. \nGOS Graduate Outcomes Survey – biennial survey of Alberta post-secondary graduates, conducted two years \npost-graduation (includes undergraduate and graduate levels) \nCGPSS Canadian Graduate and Professional Student Survey – national survey of student satisfaction \nCAST Contract Academic Staff – Teaching \nTRC Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada \nSTARS Sustainability Tracking, Assessment and Rating System  \n2 \nOverview of Performance Indicators \nFPG Alignment Government (public) reporting Internal indicators \nBUILD \n1.

Target-setting may require comparative analysis \nand will require validation through the Office of the Provost. \n• Student satisfaction \nFPG Goal for Experience: “diverse and rewarding learning opportunities that … enable our success” \nStudent satisfaction is surveyed by the National Survey of Student Engagement (NSSE) for \nundergraduates and the Canadian Graduate and Professional Student Survey (CGPSS) for those groups. \nTarget setting for this indicator should recognize that satisfaction results are not highly responsive in \nthe short term, and respond to variables that are beyond institutional control. \n5 \nSample (2014 NSSE) \nPercentage rating overall experience as “Excellent” or “Good,” U of A and U15 peers  \nSample (2016 CGPSS) \nPercentage reporting \nthey would select the \nsame university again \nif starting over \nDefinitely Probably Maybe Probably not Definitely not \n33.4% 39.3% 16.2% 7.1% 4.1% \n• Employment outcomes two years after graduation \nFPG Goal for Experience: “diverse and rewarding learning opportunities that … enable our success” \nThe Graduate Outcomes Survey (GOS) is administered biannually, and surveys students two years post-\ngraduation on satisfaction, financing and employment outcomes. Targets may not be appropriate for \nthis indicator, as incomes reflect both environmental and institutional factors. Reporting will present U \nof A results relative to all Alberta graduates.  \nSample (2014 survey of 2012 graduates) \nAverage income by degree level, U of A \n6 \nEmployment rate by degree level, U of A \n Note: excludes respondents not in labour force. \n• Experiential learning opportunities and High-Impact Practices \nObjective 7: Experiential learning; Objective 8: Extracurricular learning \nThe NSSE surveys students on their participation in High-Impact Practices (HIPs) which facilitate \nlearning outside the classroom. Units also track participation in some experiential activities.  The \nfollowing will likely be supplemented with qualitative summaries of other experiential learning \nopportunities (from faculty reports). \nSample (NSSE 2014)  \nOverall High-Impact \nPractice participation  \n First-year Senior \nU of A 46% \n84%  \n(59% more than one) \nU15 42% \n80% \n(53% more than one) \nSources: NSSE 2014.

Current institutional targets refer only to relative U15 position.  \nSample (2015-16 Annual Report) \nSponsored research funding, \nU15 relative position  \nPrior Year's Results Last Actual  Target  \n2010-11 2011-12 2012-13 2013-14 2015-16 \n3 5 5 5 Top 5 \nSource: Canadian Association of University Business Officers (CAUBO), Financial Information of Universities and \nColleges, Report 3.1. Data are the most recent available. \n• Citation impact \nObjective 11: Reputation for research excellence; Objective 13: Support excellence in research \nThe research activity of U of A faculty is not fully captured by citation data, and the university will \ncontinue to explore alternatives to reporting research impact. Citation impact is an important indicator \nof research impact, but no existing citation indicator is comprehensive or equally relevant across \ndisciplines. Reporting will combine data from multiple sources (as an illustrative example only, the \ntable below presents Leiden rankings on number and proportion of publications among the 10% most \ncited in field). \nSample (Leiden Rankings) \nCitation impact rankings  \nNumber of publications in top \n10% most cited in field \nProportion of publications in \ntop 10% most cited in field  \nCan. rank World rank Can. rank World rank \n 4 48 14 330 \nSource: CWTS Leiden Rankings \nNotes: The “proportion” ranking reflects the proportion of all publications attributable to U of A authors that rank among the \nmost cited in their respective fields. The “number” ranking reflects the absolute number of publications attributable to U of A \nauthors that rank among the most cited in their respective fields (this ranking tends to favour larger institutions).  \n• Student-reported experience with faculty (seniors) \nObjective 14: Support excellence in teaching and learning \n8 \nNSSE surveys students on two Experiences with Faculty indicators. Mean scores reflect the frequency \nwith which students reported positive items in each indicator category. If this indicator is retained, an \nappropriate visualization will be developed. \nSample (2014 NSSE) \nStudent-faculty \ninteraction \n Mean score \nU of A 17.7 \nU15 17.2 \nEffective teaching \npractices \nU of A 36.6 \nU15 34.8 \nSource: NSSE 2014 \nNote: Each indicator is scored on a 60-point scale. To produce an indicator score, the response set for each item is \nconverted to a 60-point scale (e.g., Never = 0; Sometimes = 20; Often = 40; Very often = 60), and the rescaled items \nare averaged. Thus a score of zero means a student responded at the bottom of the scale for every item, while a \nscore of 60 indicates responses at the top of the scale on every item. \nStudent-faculty interaction includes: discussing career plans; working with faculty on activities other than \ncoursework; discussing course concepts outside of class; discussing academic performance.  \nEffective teaching practices includes: clear course goals and requirements; organized course sessions; use of \nexamples/illustrations; providing feedback on work in progress; providing feedback on completed work. \nInternal indicators: \n• Rankings (THE and QS – overall and subject-\narea) \n• Research and teaching awards (major \nhighlights only) \n• Faculty and staff training opportunities (Gold \nCollege, Chairs’ school  and other programs as \ndeveloped) \n•  \n• Funding profile of post-doctoral fellows (under \ndevelopment \n• Tri-Council grants (number received per faculty \nand success rate compared to competition \naverage), by agency) \nENGAGE \nPrimary indicators attempt to capture the impact of engagement on student development, communities and \ninstitutional reputation. Qualitative reports in this area are critical and need to be developed. \nNOTE: Media impact metrics developed under Build are relevant to Engage Objective 16: Community \nengagement and engaged research \n• Student-reported citizenship development (seniors) \nObjective 16: Community engagement and engaged research \n9 \nSample (NSSE 2014) \nHow much has your experience at this institution contributed to your knowledge, skills, and personal \ndevelopment in being an informed and active citizen?

All BA students were \ninvited to attend to ask questions and give feedback.  \no The event was well attended and the students’ thoughtful \nobservations, along with the complete record of students’ \ncontributions, were added to the Faculty’s consideration \nof the BA Curriculum Renewal.  \n A survey was distributed on March 10, 2016 (closing March 20, \n2016), to gauge students’ and faculty members’ initial response \nto the BA Renewal Discussion Paper.  \no The survey garnered nearly 1000 responses, with 831 \nstudents and 167 faculty members submitting their \nopinions. The aggregated results were made available on \nApril 7, 2016. 3  \n On April 27, 2016 Associate Dean Ball met with the executive \nmembers of OASIS to discuss the results of the surveys. \n Associate Dean Ball met with representatives from the Graduate \nStudent Association (GSA) on May 19, 2016 to explore the \nimpacts the proposed changes to the BA may have on graduate \nstudent recruitment and retention.  \n A meeting to discuss the BA Renewal Proposal with OASIS was \nheld on September 22, 2016.  \n Dean Lesley Cormack moderated a second town hall meeting on \nSeptember 30, 2016.  \no Once again, more than 100 students, staff, and faculty \nattended this open forum.  \no A video recording of the town hall can be viewed online.  \no An online form was circulated prior to the event, inviting \nfeedback about the BA Curriculum Renewal Discussion \nPaper from those who would not be able to attend the \ntown hall.  \no An update on the BA Renewal Proposal process was \npresented by Associate Dean Ball at Arts Faculty Council \non October 3, 2016. \nThose who are actively participating: \n Dean Lesley Cormack (History and Classics) \n Acting Dean/Vice-Dean Lise Gotell (Women’s and Gender \nStudies) \nItem No. 9 \nGFC EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE \nFor the Meeting of January 16, 2017 \n Acting Vice-Dean Stuart Landon (Economics) \n Associate Dean (Graduate) Tom Spalding (Psychology)  \n Associate Dean (Research) Michael O’Driscoll (English and Film \nStudies) \n Associate Dean (Research) Steve Patten (Political Science) \n Associate Dean (Student Programs) Rebecca Nagel (History and \nClassics)  \n Associate Dean (Student Programs: Teaching & Learning) Allen \nBall (Art and Design) \n Senior Officer (Student Programs & Services) Robin A Cowan \nFormal Governance Path: \nThe proposed changes to the BA Basic Requirements follow the \nstandard governance pathway.  \n Within the Faculty of Arts, changes were reviewed and \nunanimously approved by  \no Academic Affairs Committee (AAC) on October 26, 2016,  \nand  \no Arts Executive Committee (AEC) on November 3, 2016.  \n And passed by Arts Faculty Council (AFC) on November 24, \n2016.  \nThese changes will affect calendar section entries for the Bachelor of \nArts (BA), BA Honors Program Requirements, and the After Degree \nPrograms (included here) \nAlignment/Compliance \nAlignment with Guiding \nDocuments \nBUILD \n This BA renewal proposal forms a critical part of a broader effort \nby the Faculty of Arts to offer a truly outstanding BA program that \nwill attract and retain the very best and brightest students from \nAlberta, Canada, and the world. \nEXPERIENCE \n The revised BA will provide space for students to engage in one \nor more of the variety of exceptional experiential learning \nopportunities, whether it be research, study abroad, community-\nservice learning, or work experience. \nEXCEL \n We believe that the proposed BA redesign will make the Faculty \nof Arts attractive to students across Canada, creating room for \ndistinction and distinctiveness in teaching, learning, research, \nand service, since the redesign allows departments to refocus \ncourse offerings in areas of excellence and interest to students. \nENGAGE \n Faculty emphasis is on community engagement.  The revised BA \nallows us to expand opportunities for students within their degree \nprograms to reach broader and more diverse community partners \nwhile deepening ties to current partners.  (for example, allowing \nmore room for students to engage in work experience, \nItem No. 9 \nGFC EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE \nFor the Meeting of January 16, 2017 \ncommunity service-learning, international learning experiences, \nand research with their instructors in the community). \nSUSTAIN \n The revised BA maintains breadth and depth in study, while \nallowing Departments the opportunity redirect teaching resources \nto areas of excellence. \n The proposed requirements facilitate more straightforward \ntransition for students transferring to Arts from other programs at \nthe University of Alberta and other post-secondary institutions \nthan is currently possible. \n A flexible Arts degree means that our students will easily be able \nto accommodate any mandated Faculty or University-wide \nIndigenous studies requirement in their degrees, should this \nrequirement be embraced institutionally.  \nCompliance with Legislation, \nPolicy and/or Procedure \nRelevant to the Proposal \n(please quote legislation and \ninclude identifying section \nnumbers) \n1.

Statistics \nStudents taking a Science minor are not permitted to \ncomplete a minor in the same department as their \nmajor. \n5. Cross-Listed Courses: Courses listed in more \nthan one major/minor are known as cross-\nlisted courses. \nThe use of cross-listed courses is especially \ncommon in interdisciplinary programs (East \nAsian Studies; Film Studies; International \nStudies; Native Studies; Science Technology \nand Society; Women's and Gender Studies), \nbut is becoming increasingly common in other \nareas also (e.g. Religious Studies). Unless \notherwise notified by the student, the \nUndergraduate Student Services Office will \napply cross-listed courses to the specific \nsubject discipline. For example, a CLASS \ncourse cross-listed with Religious Studies will \napply to the Classics major or minor unless the \nstudent has advised the Undergraduate \nStudent Services Office in writing that it should \napply to the Religious Studies portion of the \nstudent's program. When students ask that a \ncross-listed course be applied to their other \nsubject of concentration, that course will then \nbe applied to the minimums and maximums for \nthat other subject. \nFor further details on cross-listed courses, see \nthe entries for interdisciplinary programs below. \n6. Junior Courses: Maximum of ★48 at the \njunior level are permitted for credit to the \nprogram. Students should complete ★30 at the \njunior level before registering in senior-level \ncourses. \n7. Combined Major in French and \nSpanish: Apart from the option to declare a \ndouble major in French and Spanish with no \nminor [see above], students may opt to take \nthese two related languages which can be \ncombined as their major subject; a valid minor \nsubject is still required when this option is \nselected. The following conditions apply: \na. Students selecting a combined \nlanguage major should take two \nlanguages other than English in the \nfirst year, deferring any other basic \nrequirement except the Junior ENGL to \ndo so. \nb. Students majoring in two languages \nother than English must take a \nminimum of ★12 at the senior level in \neach language and normally must \ninclude a minimum of ★3 in each \nlanguage at the 400-level. In all other \ncomplete a minor in the same department as their \nmajor. \n5. Course Maximum: No more than *48 at the \nsenior level applicable to any one major is permitted, \nwhether or not a major in that discipline has been \ndeclared. \n 6. Cross-Listed Courses: Courses listed in more \nthan one major/minor are known as cross-listed \ncourses. \n. Unless otherwise notified by the student, the \nUndergraduate Student Services Office will apply \ncross-listed courses to the specific subject \ndiscipline. For example, a CLASS course cross-\nlisted with Religious Studies will apply to the \nClassics major or minor unless the student has \nadvised the Undergraduate Student Services Office \nin writing that it should apply to the Religious \nStudies portion of the student's program. When \nstudents ask that a cross-listed course be applied to \ntheir other subject of concentration, that course will \nthen be applied to the minimums and maximums for \nthat other subject. \nFor further details on cross-listed courses, see the \nentries for interdisciplinary programs below. \n. 7. Junior Courses: A maximum of ★48 at the \njunior level is permitted for credit to the program. \nStudents should complete ★30 at the junior level \nbefore registering in senior-level courses. \n. 8. Combined Major in French and Spanish: Apart \nfrom the option to declare two major(s) in French \nand Spanish [see above], students may opt to take \nthese two related languages as one major. Students \nwith a combined major in French and Spanish must \ntake a minimum of ★12 at the senior level in each \nlanguage and normally must include a minimum of \n★3 in each language at the 400-level. In all other \nrespects, the requirements for a major in the above \nsection apply. \n9. Non-Arts or Non-Science Options: A maximum \nof ★18 may be taken outside the Faculties of Arts \nand Science as long as the courses do not duplicate \ncourses already offered by these two \nFaculties.

To \nbring clarity to this document, two sections from the original draft proposal have been moved to \nthe appendices: History of the BA Curriculum Review Process is now located in Appendix A; \nand Ongoing BA Curriculum Renewal Consultation Process is now located in Appendix B. \nThe goal of the BA Curriculum Renewal is to develop a simpler, less prescriptive, and a \nsustainable BA program that provides Arts students with an exemplary undergraduate degree, \nwhile maintaining, at its heart, a liberal arts philosophy that is contextualized within our large-\nscale research intensive university. A renewed BA at the University of Alberta must be flexible \nenough to accommodate the exceptional breadth and depth in programming offered in the \nFaculty of Arts. This renewed BA must also continue to enable a broad range of pedagogical \nmethods, from traditional instructional strategies to community-engaged experiential learning, \nwhile retaining our rigorous academic standards.  \nCurrent Context for the BA Curriculum Renewal Process \nA number of factors inform the current institutional, provincial, and national contexts in which \nthe BA Curriculum Renewal occurs. First, in June 2015, the Government of Alberta introduced \nBill 3, the Appropriation (Interim Supply) Act. Bill 3 reversed cuts made by the previous \nprovincial administration (including a 1.4 percent reduction to post-secondary funding), \nincreased base funding for post-secondary institutions by two percent, cancelled market \nmodifiers that had previously been approved for 25 programs in Alberta, and restored \napprenticeship and targeted enrolment funding. As well, the Bill implemented a two-year freeze \non tuition and mandatory non-instructional fees for post-secondary students in both the 2015-16 \nand 2016-17 academic years.\n3\n In Fall 2015, the Government also began a review of the overall \n1\n University of Alberta. “Arts – Chart 1: Basic Requirements.” University of Alberta Calendar 2016-\n2017, http://www.registrar.ualberta.ca/calendar/Undergrad/Arts/chart1.html.

If the Arts BA \nprogram is re-worked now to meet our goals, the Faculty will be better positioned to face future \nchallenges and to take advantage of emergent opportunities. \nWithin our institution, central administrative units are also planning for substantive change. On \nMay 30, 2016, General Faculties Council recommended approval of the University of Alberta’s \nnew institutional strategic plan (ISP) “For the Public Good” (Au Service de l'intérêt public), \nwhich was ratified by the Board of Governors on June 17, 2016.\n5\n The strategic goals of the ISP \nare as follows: \n     In For the Public Good—our institutional strategic plan for the coming decade—we \nembrace and affirm our vision to inspire the human spirit through outstanding \nachievements in learning, discovery, and citizenship in a creative community, building one \nof the world’s great universities for the public good. \nWe forge ahead, motivated and supported by the University of Alberta’s 108-year history \nof leadership, achievement, and public service. Inspired by this plan, we will strive to \nachieve the following strategic goals: \nBUILD a diverse, inclusive community of exceptional students, faculty, and staff from \nAlberta, Canada, and the world. \nEXPERIENCE diverse and rewarding learning opportunities that inspire us, nurture our \ntalents, expand our knowledge and skills, and enable our success. \nEXCEL as individuals, and together, sustain a culture that fosters and champions \ndistinction and distinctiveness in teaching, learning, research, and service. \nENGAGE communities across campuses, city and region, province, nation, and the world \nto create reciprocal, mutually beneficial learning experiences, research projects, \npartnerships, and collaborations. \nSUSTAIN our people, our work, and the environment by attracting and stewarding the \nresources we need to deliver excellence to the benefit of all. \n4\n Government of Alberta. “Tuition and Fees Freeze Begins for Post-secondary Students.” Government of \nAlberta, Announcements, 8 Sep. 2015, http://alberta.ca/release.cfm?xID=38498C947FED3-E72C-6CA8-\n6297F33D57AD6D0D.

As outlined in the introduction to the “Discussion Paper”: \nthe environment within which we recruit students has been changing as a result of \nprovincial and national trends. Post-secondary participation rates within the province are \ncomparatively low [Alberta Innovation and Advanced Education], the number of degree- \ngranting institutions in Alberta has increased [Canadian Association of University \nTeachers Bulletin], and national demographics have shifted [Statistics Canada]. These \nfactors have combined to result in a smaller pool of potential undergraduate students \nnationally, prompting increasing and aggressive recruitment of Alberta students by other \nout-of-province institutions.\n7\nAs a backdrop to the BA Curriculum Renewal, a number of significant demographic shifts have \nemerged since the introduction of the current BA structure in the 2006-2007 academic year. \nFrom 2006 to 2016, the population of the Edmonton Metropolitan area increased by 26.9% (see \nAppendix C), while Faculty of Arts undergraduate enrollment declined by 5.5% (see Appendix \nD). Although the general population (and local pool of potential applicants) has increased \nsignificantly, the Faculty of Arts has seen a decrease in enrolled students. This negative trend is \nfurther complicated by the fact that, in the 2006-2007 academic year, international students \naccounted for 5.4% of Arts undergraduates whereas they comprise over 21.5% of Arts \nundergraduates in 2016-2017 (see Appendix E). In 2016-17, there are 850 fewer domestic \nundergraduate students enrolled annually in the Faculty of Arts than there were in 2006-2007.  \nAlthough it is impossible to know or weigh all the potential factors causing enrollments to fall or \nto account for the significant decrease in domestic students, the number of peer institutions \noffering liberal arts education in the Edmonton region suggest a strong demand locally for arts \neducation. For instance, MacEwan University and King’s University became BA degree-granting \ninstitutions in 2004. \nWhile it is clear from the BA Curriculum Renewal consultation process that the Faculty of Arts \nbelieves strongly in sustaining a liberal arts model, we must respond to the growing pressure to \narticulate the value of our BA degree effectively in this new educational environment, as well as \nto communicate its benefits and outcomes clearly to students, parents, employers, and \ngovernment. In light of these demographic shifts and the increasingly competitive environment \n6\n University of Alberta. “Institutional Strategic Plan: For the Public Good.” University of Alberta.

DES, MUSIC, WRITE) \nb) *6 Group 2 – study of cultures (CHINA, CHRTC, \nCHRTP, CLASS, C LIT, EASIA, ENGL, FREN, FS, \nGERM, GREEK, HIST, ITAL, JAPAN, KOREA, LA ST, \nMLCS, PHIL, POLISH, PORT, RELIG, RUSS, SCAND, \nSLAV, SPAN) \nc) *6 Group 3 – social systems (ANTHR, CSL, EAS (Arts \ncourses only), ECON, HGP, INT D, LING, MEAS, POL \nS, PSYCO (Arts courses only), STS, SOC, WGS) \nThe current BA Basic Requirements are based on a distribution model that grounds a traditional \nliberal arts education in a breadth of disciplines and methodologies. On the one hand, in \nprinciple, the distribution model enforces breadth of study in students’ degree programs. On the \nother hand, it is not clear how these requirements relate to the many and diverse types of Arts \nmajors, or how they benefit students during and after their degrees. The weakest aspect to this \nmodel is that the basic requirements rarely align with courses taken as part of a student’s \ndeclared major nor do they connect with one another. Furthermore, the pedagogical value of \nthese particular basic requirements has not been clearly linked to our research-intensive \ninstitutional focus. \nA variety of approaches to the structuring of BA programs are employed in Canadian \nuniversities, along with a broad threshold of basic credit requirements among the top 20-ranked \nCanadian universities (see Appendix F). The lowest number of BA program basic requirement \ncredits is in the Faculty of Arts at the University of Calgary, which since 2010, requires only *6 \ncredits from the Faculty of Science, with all other requirements determined by departments or \nprograms offering majors. By contrast, students in BA programs within the University of Alberta \nFaculty of Arts face the highest number of basic requirements among the top 20 comparable \nCanadian programs, with *36 basic course credits needed to graduate.  \n8\n University of Alberta. “Arts – Chart 1: Basic Requirements.” University of Alberta Calendar 2016-2017, \nhttp://www.registrar.ualberta.ca/calendar/Undergrad/Arts/chart1.html. Accessed 18 Oct. 2016. \nhttp://www.registrar.ualberta.ca/calendar/Undergrad/Arts/chart1.html\nBA Curriculum Renewal Proposal \nFaculty of Arts – November 2016 \n6 \nHaving the highest number of BA basic requirements among top Canadian institutions produces \na number of challenges for our Faculty. First, the high number of requirements is dissuading high \nschool students from choosing our program for their post-secondary education; they now have \nother more attractive and less complex options locally, provincially, and nationally.\n9\n The current \nrequirements also make transferring into the Faculty of Arts difficult and potentially unattractive \nto prospective students from colleges, other University of Alberta programs, and other \nuniversities.\n10\n As well, the Faculty of Arts encompasses a wide variety of disciplines; but, the \nhigh number of basic requirements neutralizes this diversity in programming by imposing \nsimilarity across majors and ignoring distinct disciplinary differences. In short, other institutions \nprovide more flexibility to students; and, students increasingly opt for the program flexibility \naccessible at other institutions. Our current program does not represent or maximize the value of \nour diverse offerings. We are losing students to more attractive and easier-to-navigate programs \noffered elsewhere, even though we provide comparable or superior course offerings.  \nThe Faculty of Arts Dean’s Office has engaged and consulted widely over the course of the BA \nCurriculum Renewal process, hearing from key campus partners and stakeholders, including \nstudents, faculty, contract instructors, staff, and alumni. Our BA Renewal Surveys generated \nover 800 student responses\n11\n and nearly 150 faculty responses.\n12\n In addition, we collected over \n370 written responses to the original discussion paper from a variety of different forums. The \nrevised recommendations detailed below are drawn directly from the input received during this \ncomprehensive consultation process. \nTo enhance our competitiveness among peer institutions and strengthen the quality and \nflexibility of our BA degree, the Faculty of Arts proposes these basic requirements for the \nUniversity of Alberta Bachelor of Arts: \n *120 \no The 120 credit minimum remains unchanged. \n one major (*30-*48 maximum at the senior level)  \no The major credit threshold remains unchanged. \n9\n University of Alberta Office of the Registrar. “Acceptance Decline Survey- Final Report November 2015” \n[unpublished].

The maximum of *48 in any single Arts discipline and the *6 required in non-Arts \ndisciplines mean that students must experiment by taking courses in several disciplines, \nregardless of their chosen major in order to complete the *120 credit minimum. \n3. The added flexibility will create significantly more opportunities for students to take double \nmajors and/or multiple minors. For example, a student could graduate with a single major, \ntwo majors, or the option of a major and one or more minors. \n4. If students no longer require minors (which, by their very nature, are limited to single \ndepartments), they would be free to undertake more of the certificates that are developed and \noffered across disciplines and departments.  \n5. Students will also take on greater responsibility for designing their programs, an important \nfacet of the educational experience. \n6. The proposed requirements enable a straightforward transition for students transferring to \nArts from other programs at the University of Alberta and other post-secondary institutions.  \n7. The requirement for *6 of non-Arts credits guarantees that students will be exposed to the \ndisciplinary perspectives and pedagogical environments of other Faculties and programs, \nwhich will ensure and enrich students’ experiences of the full breadth of university learning. \n8. A flexible Arts degree means that our students will easily be able to accommodate any \nmandated University-wide Indigenous studies requirement in their degrees, should this \nrequirement be embraced institutionally.  \nBA Curriculum Renewal Proposal \nFaculty of Arts – November 2016 \n10 \nThe new common requirements introduce significant flexibility to students, while sustaining the \nacademic excellence and rigour of Faculty of Arts programs. This structural shift creates a \ncontinuum of options that can adapt to both specific departmental programmatic outcomes and \ndisciplinary specificity, while simultaneously facilitating breadth in pedagogical scope and \ncurricular demands.  \nGovernance Pathway for the Proposed Changes to BA Basic Requirements \nThe proposed changes to the BA Basic Requirements follow the standard governance pathway. \nWithin the Faculty of Arts, changes were reviewed and approved first by Academic Affairs \nCommittee (AAC) on October 26, 2016 and by Arts Executive Committee (AEC) on November \n3, 2016. Arts Faculty Council (AFC) will consider and vote on the proposal November 24, 2016.  \nSince there are no changes to academic standing, admissions (including high school subjects to \nbe used for admission), or graduation requirements, the proposed changes will not need to be \napproved by Academic Standards Committee (ASC) of GFC. Approval of GFC is required \nthrough routine circulation in Winter 2017 for implementation in Fall 2018.  \nThe BA Curriculum Renewal proposal, as it stands, would require a number of University of \nAlberta Calendar changes. These changes will affect calendar section entries for the Bachelor of \nArts (BA), BA Honors Program Requirements, and the After Degree Programs. \nNext Steps in the BA Curriculum Renewal Process \nThe BA Curriculum Renewal is an opportunity for us as a Faculty to shape our future together. \nThis proposal promotes a new BA structure that will replace our current BA Basic Curriculum. \nThe new common requirements will increase flexibility for students, departments, and the \nFaculty, and ensure our requirements are competitive with other post-secondary institutions. \nThe proposed changes will affect the way we advise our students and offer guidance in building \ntheir programs through appropriate course selection. In consultation with Departments, \nspecifically through the Arts Teaching and Learning Engagement Committee (ATLEC), which \nconsists of every departmental undergraduate Associate Chair, student representatives, and \nSenior Advisors in Undergraduate Student Services, the Faculty of Arts will create a series of \nthematic pathways as optional guides for students. The pathways will act as roadmaps for our \nUndergraduate Student Services advisors to guide students in their first year. \nAssociate Dean Allen Ball will lead the consultation process in developing the thematic \npathways, which will ensure that our diverse programs can be promoted equally, thus exposing \nstudents to the full range of departments and disciplines. It is envisaged that the optional \nthematic pathways will echo and build upon the extensive work developed over the last five \nyears in defining BA attributes (see Appendix G), while also providing opportunities to inform \nstudents of the multiple ways of achieving breadth and diversity in their Arts education. \nBA Curriculum Renewal Proposal \nFaculty of Arts – November 2016 \n11 \nIt is imperative that the Faculty of Arts and its departments design this renewed BA and its \nthematic pathways together, such that we construct a degree program that is flexible enough to \nmeet future challenges and well positioned to take advantage of emergent opportunities. \nTogether, these recommendations form a critical part of a broader effort by the Faculty of Arts to \noffer a truly outstanding BA program that will attract and retain the very best and brightest \nstudents from Alberta, Canada, and the world.  \nHistory of the BA Curriculum Review Process\t \nIn November 2011, Arts Faculty Council approved a five-year Academic Plan that included a \nsystematic review of the BA general requirements.1 \nAfter determining the reasons why such a review was necessary, five working groups were \nformed in September 2012 to develop visions for the future of the BA degree. A series of open \nmeetings and focus group sessions were held with the members of the five working groups and \nothers in the Faculty of Arts. These lengthy discussions centered on the question of whether or \nnot to define the BA degree in terms of “attributes.”  \n“Attributes” were defined as the qualities, values, and dispositions that students develop during \nthe process of obtaining an Arts degree. Broader than — but including — skills, attributes are not \ndiscipline-specific and are developed by all students as they progress through their degrees. The \nworking group discussions were informed by specialists in curriculum development, including \nDr. Jennifer Summit from Stanford University and Dr. John Galaty from McGill University, who \npresented lectures in January 2013 (see Appendix H). \nThe five working groups were merged into a single Task Force in February 2013. The Task \nForce members investigated the ways in which other universities, primarily in the United States \nand Australia, had organized their BA basic requirements around the concept of attributes. \nComprehensive surveys of University of Alberta undergraduates were conducted in 2011-2012, \nusing some of the various guiding principles used by other institutions across the world (see \nAppendix I). \nA set of key attributes were put forward at the end of 2013, along with a proposed table of BA \nrequirements, which clearly outlined the number of course credits and expected learning \noutcomes for each set of attributes (see Appendix J). Five core attributes were identified: \n• Analysis and Interpretation \n• Research, Creation, and Inquiry \n• Communication and Culture \n• Global Citizenship \n• Lifelong, Adaptive, and Engaged Learning \nThis working proposal was then sent out to all stakeholders in the Faculty of Arts for feedback. \nIn September 2014, an ad hoc committee was constituted at the request of Dean Lesley Cormack \nand Associate Dean Mickey Adolphson, then-Chair of the BA Curriculum Review. This \ncommittee was asked to bring the work of earlier iterations of the BA Review Committee to \nfruition by drafting a proposal based on the attributes for presentation to Arts Faculty Council. In \nSpring 2015, a draft entitled “The BA Core Review – The Proposed Attributes BA” (see \nAppendix J) was presented to various Arts stakeholder groups, including Undergraduate Student \nServices, Dean’s Executive Council, and Chairs Council.  \n1\tUniversity of Alberta Faculty of Arts. “Academic Plan.” University of Alberta Faculty of Arts, \nhttps://www.ualberta.ca/arts/about/academic-plan. Accessed 18 Oct. 2016.\t\n11\nBA Curriculum Renewal Proposal \nFaculty of Arts – October 2016 \n2 \nThere were concerns expressed that the attribute model was too complex and would make \nadvising individual students nearly impossible. It also became clear that there was a perception \nthat a full conversation about the attributes themselves had not yet happened, including whether \nthe identified attributes were the appropriate ones on which to form the foundation for our BA \nrequirements. Further, it was obvious that many, if not most, of the degree programs offered by \nthe Faculty incorporated many of these attributes, so it was not clear why the required core \nwould need to duplicate the efforts of these offerings by requiring specific types of core courses. \nThe draft proposal was brought to Arts Executive Committee and the Committee voted against \nforwarding the proposal to Arts Faculty Council.  \nAlthough the Faculty did not move forward with the recommendations as presented, it was \nagreed, in principle, by the Dean’s Executive Council that the identified attributes were a \nvaluable means of understanding undergraduate programs, shifting attention away from thinking \nabout content and towards the diverse skills and competencies our students gain throughout their \ndegrees. Disciplinary requirements are the primary mechanism that shape students’ paths \nthroughout their degrees. These discipline-specific program requirements develop many of the \ncore attributes that become the transferable skills with which students enter the workforce upon \ngraduation. Exactly how these attributes are embedded in the trajectories of specific majors and \nminors is best determined by each individual department or program.  \n12\nOngoing BA Curriculum Renewal Consultation Process \nIn July 2015, Associate Dean (Student Programs: Teaching and Learning) Allen Ball took on the \nleadership of the BA Curriculum Review process. The review process was renamed the BA \nCurriculum Renewal, and direction was given to draft a new BA Curriculum Renewal proposal \nfor consideration by all members of the Faculty of Arts by the end of the 2015-2016 academic \nyear. \nAssociate Dean Ball has undertaken a consultative process with input from the 2015-2016 \nDean’s Executive Councils, which included the following members of faculty: \n• Acting Dean Lise Gotell (Women’s and Gender Studies) \n• Acting Vice-Dean Stuart Landon (Economics) \n• Associate Dean (Graduate) Tom Spalding (Psychology) \n• Associate Dean (Research) Michael O’Driscoll (English and Film Studies) \n• Associate Dean (Student Programs) Rebecca Nagel (History and Classics) \n• Associate Dean (Teaching and Learning) Allen Ball (Art and Design) \nAdditional input has also been received from the following faculty members of the 2016-2017 \nDean’s Executive Council:  \n• Dean Lesley Cormack (History and Classics) \n• Vice-Dean Lise Gotell (Women’s and Gender Studies) \n• Associate Dean (Graduate) Tom Spalding (Psychology) \n• Associate Dean (Research) Steve Patten (Political Science) \n• Associate Dean (Student Programs) Rebecca Nagel (History and Classics) \n• Associate Dean (Teaching and Learning) Allen Ball (Art and Design) \nDuring the 2015-2016 academic year, Associate Dean Ball held individual meetings with all 15 \nFaculty of Arts Department Chairs, as well as the Executive Director of Community Service-\nLearning and the Director of the Office of Interdisciplinary Studies:  \n• Dr. Pamela Willoughby, Chair (Anthropology)  \n• Professor Cezary Gajewski, Chair (Art and Design) \n• Dr. David Peacock, Executive Director (Community Service-Learning)  \n• Professor Betty Moulton, Chair (Drama)  \n• Dr. Constance Smith, Chair (Economics)  \n• Dr. Walter Davis, Interim Chair (East Asian Studies)  \n• Dr. Peter Sinnema, Chair (English and Film Studies)  \n• Dr. David Marples (History and Classics)  \n• Dr. Sean Gouglas, Director (Office of Interdisciplinary Studies)  \n• Dr. Herbert Colston, Chair (Linguistics)  \n• Dr. Laura Beard, Chair (Modern Languages and Cultural Studies) \n• Professor William Street, Chair (Music) \n• Dr. Jack Zupko, Chair (Philosophy) \n• Dr. Lois Harder, Chair (Political Science) \n• Dr. Jeff Bisanz, Chair (Psychology) \n• Dr. Gillian Stevens, Acting Chair (Sociology) \n13\nBA Curriculum Renewal Proposal \nFaculty of Arts – October 2016 \n2 \n• Dr. Philomena Okeke, Acting Chair (Women’s and Gender Studies) \nOngoing updates on the BA Curriculum Renewal process have been provided by Associate Dean \nBall to members of the central administration, including: \n• Meg Brolley, General Faculty Council Secretary  \n• Dr. Sarah Forgie, Vice Provost (Learning Initiatives) \n• Dr. Nat Kav, Vice Provost (Academic Programs and Instruction) \n• Kate Peters, Portfolio Initiatives Manager, Office of the Provost and Vice-President \n(Academic).  \nFurther, discussions are underway with Dr. Christine Brown, Head Librarian, to identify and \naddress any resource implications that the proposed BA Curriculum Renewal may generate for \nlibrary services. \nThe potential changes to our BA have also been discussed with Faculties across campus. To date, \nthe following Associate Deans and Deans have been consulted on this initiative by Associate \nDean Ball: \n• Dr. Jason Carey, Associate Dean (Programs & Planning), Faculty of Engineering \n• Dr. Janice Causgrove Dunn, Associate Dean (Undergraduate Programs), Faculty of Physical \nEducation and Recreation \n• Dr. Robin Everall, Interim Vice-Provost and Dean of Students \n• Dr. Elaine Geddes, Associate Dean (Undergraduate), Alberta School of Business \n• Dr. Clive Hickson, Associate Dean (Undergraduate Programs and Services), Faculty of \nEducation \n• Dr. Tim Joseph, Associate Dean (Student & Co-op Services), Faculty of Engineering \n• Dr. Brenda Leskiw, Senior Associate Dean (Undergraduate), Faculty of Science \n• Dr. Karsten Mundel, Director & Associate Dean (Academic), Augustana Campus \n• Dr. Frank Tough, Associate Dean (Academic), Faculty of Native Studies \nAn update on the BA Curriculum Renewal consultation process was presented by Associate \nDean Ball at Arts Faculty Council on October 5, 2015. The process has also been discussed \nextensively in each 2015-2016 Arts Teaching and Learning Enhancement Committee meeting \nand at the Associate Chairs (Undergraduate) 2015-2016 meetings.  \nRoundtable sessions have taken place with the Undergraduate Student Services staff to address \nthe possible administrative impacts of different changes to the BA basic requirements. In \naddition, the Recruitment and Engagement team have articulated the needs and interests of \nprospective students.  \nThe Faculty of Arts: BA Curriculum Renewal Discussion Paper was distributed across the \nFaculty on January 8, 2016. The proposal was initially discussed at Faculty of Arts Chairs \nCouncil on January 20, 2016, and again at Faculty of Arts Chairs Council on February 3, 2016. \nAssociate Dean Ball also presented and discussed the proposal at Arts Executive Council on \nFebruary 25, 2016.    \n14\nBA Curriculum Renewal Proposal \nFaculty of Arts – October 2016 \n3 \nA town hall meeting was held on February 5, 2016. More than 100 students, staff, and faculty \nattended this open forum. An online form was also circulated prior to the event, inviting \nfeedback about the BA Curriculum Renewal Discussion Paper from those who would not be able \nto attend the town hall.1 \nDuring Winter 2016, Associate Dean Ball presented the BA Curriculum Renewal Discussion \nPaper at the following Departmental Councils: Anthropology; Art and Design; English and Film \nStudies; History and Classics; Linguistics; Modern Languages and Cultural Studies; and \nPhilosophy. \nWe have developed an open and robust dialogue with students about the renewal process through \nnumerous discussions with our Faculty of Arts Students’ Association, OASIS (Organization for \nArts Students and Interdisciplinary Studies). Associate Dean Ball was invited to participate in a \nstudent town hall organized by OASIS on March 8, 2016. All BA students were invited to attend \nto ask questions and give feedback. The event was well attended and the students’ thoughtful \nobservations, along with the complete record of students’ contributions, were added to the \nFaculty’s consideration of the BA Curriculum Renewal.2 \nA survey was distributed on March 10, 2016 (closing March 20, 2016), to gauge students’ and \nfaculty members’ initial response to the BA Renewal Discussion Paper. The survey garnered \nnearly 1000 responses, with 831 students and 167 faculty members submitting their opinions. \nThe aggregated results were made available on April 7, 2016.3 \nOn April 27, 2016 Associate Dean Ball met with the executive members of OASIS to discuss the \nresults of the surveys. Associate Dean Ball met with representatives from the Graduate Student \nAssociation (GSA) on May 19, 2016 to explore the impacts the proposed changes to the BA may \nhave on graduate student recruitment and retention. A meeting to discuss the BA Renewal \nProposal with OASIS was held on September 22, 2016.\t\nDean Lesley Cormack moderated a second town hall meeting on September 30, 2016. Once \nagain, more than 100 students, staff, and faculty attended this open forum. A video recording of \nthe town hall can be viewed online.4 Also, an online form was circulated prior to the event, \ninviting feedback about the BA Curriculum Renewal Discussion Paper from those who would \n1 University of Alberta Faculty of Arts. “BA Renewal: Feedback From the February 5 Town Hall.” University of \nAlberta Faculty of Arts, 5 Feb. 2016, https://www.ualberta.ca/arts/about/ba-renewal/feedback-from-the-february-5-\ntown-hall.

This might encourage students to take \ncourses outside their comfort zone. F/P courses cannot be counted \ntowards any requirements for the BA or the major. \n• Some new courses will have to be created for the core attributes and \nthere needs to be a body that approves those courses. More specific \ncriteria need to be established for what constitutes a course in each \ncategory. \n• To articulate the attributes, all students will maintain an e-portfolio, \nwhere various essays, reflective pieces, creative works, and research \npapers may be included.

The bulk of this analysis was done by the Students’ Union’s previous \nUniversity Policy & Information Officer, Jessica Zvonkovic in 2012. \nINTRODUCTION \nThe following chart is a summary of responses from a question asked in the 2011 Students’ Union \nundergraduate student survey. This survey was distributed in the Fall of 2012 to all University of \nAlberta undergraduate students. It was sent by email and offered participants the chance to win a \nseries of prizes for participating. All told the survey saw 7540 participants, and this particular \nquestion was answered by 5001 participants. This question allowed participants to offer multiple \nresponses, meaning that when individually categorized, there were a total of 9,193 responses. \nThe question asked was: \n“The university is interested in defining the university experience. What qualities do you \nfeel a student should acquire as a result of their experience at the University of Alberta?” \nAs this is a very open question, respondents interpreted and answered it in unique ways. However, \nthe majority of responses can be categorized as either: Skills, Characteristics, Experiences, or \nMiscellaneous.   \n93\nResponse\nNumber \nof \nResponses\nPercent of \nSkill

of January 16, 2017 \nOUTLINE OF ISSUE \nAction Item \nAgenda Title: Proposed New Course Designator of HADVC (History of Art, Design and Visual Culture) \nin the Department of Art and Design, Faculty of Arts \nMotion:  THAT the GFC Executive Committee, with delegated authority from General Faculties Council, \napprove the new Course Designator of HADVC (History of Art, Design and Visual Culture), Faculty of Arts, to \ntake effect Fall 2017. \nItem   \nAction Requested Approval Recommendation   \nProposed by Lesley Cormack, Dean, Faculty of Arts (to be represented by R Nagel, \nAssociate Dean, Student Programs) \nPresenter Natalie Loveless, Assistant Professor, Department of Art & Design \nDetails \nResponsibility Provost and Vice-President (Academic) \nThe Purpose of the Proposal is \n(please be specific) \nThe proposed calendar changes will: \n- Change the course prefix from ART H to HADVC for all courses \ntaught in the History of Art, Design and Visual Culture area within the \nArt & Design Department (see Attachment 1) \n- Ensure that both the name of the BA major and related course prefix \nare consistent with one another.  Currently, the major is “History of \nArt, Design and Visual Culture”, and the related subject is called Art \nHistory (ART H).    \nThe Impact of the Proposal is In 2002, the Art History area changed its subject name to the History of \nArt, Design and Visual Culture in order to more clearly articulate its move \naway from an exclusive focus on the fine arts (painting, printmaking, \ndrawing and sculpture) and toward a more inclusive curriculum covering \nthe many diverse manifestations of visual production. Since 2002, \ncourses have been re-designed to explicitly include design (architecture, \ninterior design, landscape design, anatomical illustration, typography, \netc.) and new courses have been added to broaden the in depth study of \nparticular aspects of visual culture (history of design and history of \nphotography, for example). The geographic scope of our offerings has \nalso expanded during this time to include work from regions of the world \nthat do not subscribe to a western understanding of the phrase “Art \nHistory.”  \nThis move, from ART H to HADVC, will finalize a disciplinary and \ncurricular shift that has occurred over the last 15 years. \nThere may be a concern that changing the courses from \"ART H\" to \n\"HADVC\" will make that acronym less instantly understandable. \nFortunately, the full name of these courses comes first when students \nare using the ‘Browse Course Catalog’ function in Bear Tracks.  They will \nsee \"History of Art, Design and Visual Culture (HADVC)\" in the listings.  \nAbbreviations such as MLCS, HUCO, etc. do not immediately clarify their \ncontent as well as this change will for our courses.  \nIn addition, using the abbreviation HADVC instead of ART H will better \nItem No. 10 \nGFC EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE \nFor the Meeting of January 16, 2017 \nreflect the breadth and depth of the course offerings and research in our \nHADVC area to our prospective students, particularly when they are \ncomparing our program to those of our competitor programs. It is \nimportant that the \"face\" we present, through Bear Tracks, our website, \netc., is indicative of the contemporary content and design-specific \ncourses we offer, in addition to the more traditional and historical content \nthat one might expect in a course called \"ART H\" or Art History. \nReplaces/Revises (eg, policies, \nresolutions) \nThis is a new prefix for courses offered in the History of Art, Design and \nVisual Culture subject area.  \nTimeline/Implementation Date Fall 2017 \nEstimated Cost and funding \nsource \nVery small administrative cost to implement changes in Bear Tracks by \nETT, and in Academic Advisement and other materials by the Faculty \nand Department \nNext Steps (ie.: \nCommunications Plan, \nImplementation plans) \nThe Department will advise students by email, specifically to students in \nArt & Design. Students in the BFA and BDes programs meet individually \nwith the Department undergraduate advisor and will also be reminded \nverbally. \nThe Department website publishes all of their courses and will continue \nto do so under new prefix. \nArts students who are not in the BFA or BDes program will receive \nnotification via  the weekly bulletin for students.   We will also make \nchanges to the Academic Advisement module to alert students in the BA \nprogram that HADVC courses can be used toward their Group 1 (Fine \nArts) requirement. \nWe have consulted with Anna Vocioni, Assistant Registrar, and ETT is \naware these changes need to be made in Bear Tracks, which will reflect \nHADVC for the beginning of  2017-18 registration in March. \nSupplementary Notes and \ncontext \nEngagement and Routing (Include meeting dates) \nParticipation: \n(parties who have seen the \nproposal and in what capacity) \n<For further information see \nthe link posted on \nthe Governance Toolkit section \nStudent Participation Protocol> \nThose who have been informed: \nThose who have been consulted: \n• HADVC Faculty Meeting (for consultation), October 4, 2015, \nDecember 2, 2015 \n• Department Advisors (for consultation), February 8, 2016 \n• Department Chair (for consultation), February 11, 2016 \n• The Registrar’s Office (ETT, Anna Vocioni), various dates \nThose who are actively participating: \n• Department staff and faculty \n• Faculty advising staff \nhttp://www.governance.ualberta.ca/GovernanceToolkit/Toolkit.aspx\nhttp://www.governance.ualberta.ca/GovernanceToolkit/Toolkit.aspx\nItem No. 10 \nGFC EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE \nFor the Meeting of January 16, 2017 \nApproval Route (Governance) \n(including meeting dates) \nAcademic Affairs (for recommendation) - March 30, 2016 \nFaculty of Arts Executive (for recommendation) -  May 12, 2016 \nFaculty of Arts Council (for approval) - May 25, 2016 \n**Note that there is undergraduate student representation on all of these \ncommittees. \nCirculation in accordance with GFC Policy Manual section 37 – October \n2016 \nGFC Executive Committee – January 16, 2017 \nFinal Approver GFC Executive Committee \nAlignment/Compliance \nAlignment with Guiding \nDocuments \nThe new course name reflects changes that have been in effect for 15 \nyears, accurately reflects the subject area that is now much broader than \nArt History, and aligns with a world view outlined in the “For the Public \nGood”. \nThis improved reflection of courses offered is advantageous for students, \nfaculty and the University, and aligns with national and international \npractice in the field. \nCompliance with Legislation, \nPolicy and/or Procedure \nRelevant to the Proposal \n(please quote legislation and \ninclude identifying section \nnumbers) \n1.

Compliance with \nthis University policy extends to academic staff, \nadministrators, colleagues, and support staff as outlined \nand defined in the Recruitment Policy (Appendix A and \nAppendix B: Definitions and Categories) as well \nas undergraduate and graduate students, postdoctoral \nfellows, emeriti, members of the Board of Governors, \nthird party contractors, visiting speakers and volunteers. \nOverview \nAs a leading teaching and research institution whose work is local, national, and international, the University of \nAlberta is responsive to the needs of a diverse student population and workforce, as well as to the urban, rural, \nfrancophone, Aboriginal, and multicultural communities in which it does its work. The University is enriched by \ndiversity, and it welcomes and seeks to include many voices, including those that have been under-represented or \nexcluded.  \nThis policy is guided by the following principles:  \n1. Equity  \nEquity is about fairness: in access – to education, to employment – and in opportunity to succeed in these \ndomains. As a guiding principle of this policy, equity reflects an understanding that the University of Alberta is \nan increasingly diverse community and that it will respect and value the differences of its members.  \n2. Responsibility  \nResponsibility for achieving a work, study, and living environment free of harassment and discrimination falls \non  rests with every member of the University community individual to whom this Policy applies. All members \ncan reasonably expect to pursue their work and studies in a safe and respectful environment. Neither the \nUniversity nor any members of the University community associated individual shall practice or condone any \ndiscriminatory or harassing conduct that adversely affects the pursuit of work and study or life on campus. \nMembers of the University community Individuals who are aware of acts of discrimination or harassment are \nencouraged to take appropriate steps to stop the discriminatory or harassing behavior. Advice and assistance \nmay be sought from anyone in a position of authority, such as a supervisor, instructor or administrator. More \nformal advice and assistance may be sought from the Office of Safe Disclosure and Human Rights (OSDHR), \n U of A Policies and Procedures On-Line (UAPPOL) \nStudent OmbudService (SOS) Office of the Student Ombuds (OSO), the Association of Academic Staff \nUniversity of Alberta (AASUA), the Non-Academic Staff Association (NASA), Health Promotion and Worklife \nServices (HPaWS) Human Resource Services (HRS) and Organizational Health and Effectiveness (OHE), \nthe Office of the Dean of Students and Specialized Support and Disability Services (SSDS) Student \nAccessibility Services (SAS). \n3. Academic Freedom  \nThe University of Alberta’s motto, Quaecumque Vera (whatsoever things are true) declares the University’s \ncommitment to academic freedom and freedom of speech. As an institution of higher learning and research, \nthe University is devoted to discovery, debate, difference of opinion, and the careful and public weighing of \nideas and actions. Members of the University have the right to pursue the truth in their research and \npublications, artistic creations, teaching, learning, service, and public debate. This includes the right to \nquestion and criticize the status quo. Academic freedom, however, is not without limits. It is not, for example, \na justification or license for discrimination or harassment or for preventing the lawful exercise of free speech. \nPurpose \nThe purpose of this policy is to foster and protect a respectful environment for work, study, and living that supports \nthe dignity and equality of equity for all members of the University of Alberta. This policy expresses the University’s \ncommitment to a work, study, and living environment that is free of discrimination and harassment, and it ensures \nthat the University of Alberta will meet both its obligations under law and its ethical responsibilities as an institution of \nhigher learning. These legal and ethical responsibilities include the duty to accommodate and the provision of \nopportunities to persons who require accommodation based on a protected ground. \nPOLICY \n1. DISCRIMINATION OR HARASSMENT  \nIt is the policy of the University of Alberta that acts of discrimination or harassment committed by any \nindividual to whom this policy applies member of the University community are strictly prohibited. \nDiscrimination and harassment in the work, study and living environment includes, but is not limited to, \ndiscrimination and harassment on University of Alberta property, at University-related functions, in the course \nof work or study assignments outside the University, at work or study-related conferences or training \nsessions, during work or study-related travel, or by phone, computer, or other electronic means.  \nIndividuals affected by discrimination or harassment will be provided with a process for making and resolving \ncomplaints. Complaints relating to sexual violence will be addressed under the Sexual Violence Policy. \nComplaints of discrimination or harassment will be addressed and resolved in a timely manner, whenever \npossible. When a complaint of discrimination or harassment is established, appropriate action is taken, \nregardless of the authority or seniority of the offender. Individuals who engage in harassing or discriminatory \nbehaviours may be subject to disciplinary action.  \nThe University has an overriding institutional interest in maintaining an environment free from discrimination \nand harassment and may therefore itself initiate an investigation, or become a complainant, or continue with a \ncomplaint withdrawn by a complainant. \nRetaliation or reprisal against a person who has made a complaint, or against witnesses to a complaint, are \nsimilarly prohibited. Individuals who engage in retaliation may be subject to disciplinary action. \nThe University also recognizes the serious nature of allegations of discrimination and harassment that are \nmade in bad faith, and it may take disciplinary action should allegations of discrimination or harassment be \nshown to be malicious, frivolous, fraudulent, or vexatious. Submitting a complaint in good faith, even when the \ncomplaint cannot be proven established, is not a violation of this policy. \nProcedures on reporting and resolving discrimination or harassment complaints are published under this \npolicy.  \n U of A Policies and Procedures On-Line (UAPPOL) \n2. DUTY TO ACCOMMODATE  \nTo assist enable members of the University community to make their full contributions, the University of \nAlberta will take reasonable steps to accommodate individuals who are disadvantaged by employment, \ntenancy, or educational rules, standards, policies, or practices related to protected grounds to the point of \nundue hardship, or as required by law. \nThe University is committed to academic excellence. Accommodation of students with disabilities neither \nrequires nor implies that the University lower its academic or professional standards. Nor does \naccommodation relieve the students of the responsibility to develop demonstrate the essential skills and \ncompetencies required by programs, or relieve staff of the responsibility to meet the performance \nrequirements of a position in which they are accommodated.  \nAccommodation of members of the University community requires the University to take appropriate \nreasonable steps to eliminate discrimination resulting from a rule, practice or barrier that has a negative effect \non a person by reason of a protected ground. with a need for accommodation. The University’s duty to \naccommodate is far-reaching. However, the law recognizes that, in certain circumstances, a limitation on \nindividual rights may be reasonable and justifiable if the University can show that the discriminatory practice, \nstandard, decision or rule is a “bona fide requirement” (BFR) or a “bona fide occupational requirement” \n(BFOR) and/or that accommodation would impose undue hardship on the University.  \nThe University will apply current legal requirements in making such determinations. Currently, T to justify a \npractice, standard, decision or rule as a BFR or BFOR, the University must demonstrate, on a balance of \nprobabilities, that the impugned practice, standard, decision or rule:  \na) was adopted for a rational purpose connected to the performance of the job or the provision of the \nservice;  \nb) was adopted in an honest and good faith belief that it was necessary to the fulfillment of the job or \nservice;  \nc) is reasonable and necessary to the fulfillment of the job or service.  \nTo show that the practice, standard, decision or rule is reasonable and necessary, the University must \ndemonstrate that accommodation of the employee or student would impose undue hardship on the University. \nProcedures on requesting and dealing with addressing accommodation issues are published under this policy \nand include examples of accommodation measures and assessingments of undue hardship. \n3.

[▲Top] \nMembers of the University \nCommunity \nAll employees, (including but not limited to, academic staff, support staff \nand administrators), adjunct professors, professors emeriti, lecturers, \nclinical staff, all students (including undergraduate students and graduate \nstudents), and post-doctoral fellows.  \nRespectful Environment The respectful environment is characterized by a shared commitment to civility and human dignity. It values and respects academic freedom and it \nwelcomes a diversity of perspectives. It recognizes and rejects activities \nthat are harmful to mutual respect and is committed to educating members \nof the University about respect in work, study, and living environments. \nThe work, study and living environment extends beyond the University’s \ncampuses and properties and includes, but is not limited to, University-\nrelated functions, work or study assignments outside the University, work \nor study-related conferences or training sessions, work or study-related \ntravel, and communication by phone, computer, or other electronic means. \nDiscrimination A distinction, whether or not intentional, based on a characteristic or perceived characteristic referenced in the protected grounds that has the \neffect of imposing on an individual or group of individuals burdens, \nobligations or disadvantages that are not imposed on others, or of \nwithholding or limiting access to opportunities, benefits and advantages \navailable to other individuals in society.  \nHarassment Conduct or comment, either one-time or repeated that:   \na) is demeaning, intimidating, threatening, or abusive; and  \nb) is not trivial or fleeting in nature; and  \nc) causes offence and should have reasonably been expected to \noffend; and  \nd) serves no legitimate purpose for the work, study or living \nenvironment, and  \ne) undermines authority or respect in the work, study or living \nenvironment, or impairs work or learning performance, or limits \nopportunities for advancement or the pursuit of education or \nresearch, or creates an intimidating, hostile or offensive work or \nlearning environment.  \nHarassment includes bullying, which is a form of aggression that may \ninclude physical, verbal, or emotional abuse. Bullying poisons the work, \nstudy or living environment of the person it targets. It can include \npersistent, offensive, abusive, intimidating or insulting behavior, abuse of \npower, and/or unfair sanctions which make the individual feel threatened, \nhumiliated, and/or vulnerable.  \nSexual Harassment may be broadly defined as unwelcome conduct or \ncomment of a sexual nature which detrimentally affects the work, study or \nliving environment or otherwise leads to adverse consequences for the \nperson who is the target of the harassment.  \nIt may consist of unwanted sexual attention, sexually oriented remarks or \nbehaviours, or the creation of a negative psychological and emotional \nenvironment based on gender, gender identity or sexual orientation. It may \nbe an isolated act or repetitive conduct, but cannot be trifling. A reprisal or \nthreat of reprisal against an individual for rejecting a sexual solicitation or \nadvance may also constitute sexual harassment. \n U of A Policies and Procedures On-Line (UAPPOL) \nThe person(s) engaged in harassment need not have the intention to \nharass; it is the objective assessment of the circumstances that matters. \nHow would a reasonable observer perceive the situation? A complainant \nneed not expressly object to unwelcome conduct or comments, although \nany clear indication that the behaviour is unwanted will satisfy the test. A \ncomplainant's apparent passivity or failure to object overtly to sexual \nadvances does not necessarily signal consent or welcomed behaviour, \nespecially where a power imbalance exists between the individuals.  \nRacial Harassment involves unwanted or unwelcome comments, conduct \nor behavior that humiliates, intimidates, excludes or isolates an individual \nor group by focusing on their race, ethnicity, origin or religion. Overall, \nracial harassment undermines self-esteem and is a violation of the dignity \nand security of the individual or group(s) that it targets. \nDuty to Accommodate The duty to accommodate obligates the University to make reasonable adjustments, to the point of undue hardship or as required by law, to the \ndelivery of services (including teaching and the method of evaluation) and \nthe conditions of employment in order to reduce or eliminate the impact of \ndiscriminatory rules, policies, practices, standards, terms of employment, \nor decisions, which have an adverse impact on an individual or group of \nindividuals based on a characteristic or perceived characteristic referenced \nin the protected grounds.  \nAccommodation Accommodation is the process of making reasonable adjustments to the delivery of services and the conditions of employment in order to alleviate \nany adverse impacts on persons that result from the application of reduce \nor eliminate the impact of discriminatory rules, policies, practices, \nstandards, terms of employment, or decisions, due to which have an \nadverse impact on an individual or group of individuals based on a \ncharacteristic or perceived characteristic referenced in the protected \ngrounds. Accommodation is a shared responsibility between the University \nand the individual in need of accommodation, and is assessed on the \nunique circumstances of each individual. The process requires reasonable \naccommodation, not instant or perfect accommodation. The recipients of \naccommodation (e.g. students, faculty and staff) may be required to try \ndifferent accommodation options. The University is required to provide \nreasonable accommodation up to the point of undue hardship.  \nAccommodation neither requires nor implies that the University lower its \nacademic or professional standards. Nor does accommodation relieve \nstudents of the responsibility to demonstrate the essential skills and \ncompetencies required by programs or staff of the responsibility to meet \nthe performance requirements of a position in which they are \naccommodated. \nBona fide requirement (BFR) / \nBona fide occupational \nrequirement (BFOR) \nA limitation on individual rights may be reasonable and justifiable if the \nUniversity can show that a discriminatory practice, standard, decision or \nrule is a “bona fide requirement” (BFR) or “bona fide occupational \nrequirement” (BFOR). To justify such a determination Currently, to \nestablish a BFR or BFOR, , the University must demonstrate, on a balance \nof probabilities, that the impugned practice, standard, decision or rule:  \na) was adopted for a rational purpose connected to the performance of \nthe job or the provision of the service;  \nb) was adopted in an honest and good faith belief that it was \nnecessary to the fulfillment of the job or service;  \nc) is reasonable and necessary to the fulfillment of the job or service.  \nProtected Grounds Discrimination is prohibited based on the following protected grounds:  a) race  \n U of A Policies and Procedures On-Line (UAPPOL) \nb) colour  \nc) ancestry  \nd) place of origin  \ne) religious beliefs  \nf) gender, gender identity and gender expression (including \npregnancy and gender identity) \ng) physical disability  \nh) mental disability  \ni) marital status  \nj) family status  \nk) source of income  \nl) sexual orientation  \nm) age  \nn) political beliefs;  \nor any other groups as amended from time to time.  \nUndue Hardship The University has a duty to take reasonable steps to accommodate individual needs to the point of undue hardship. Undue hardship occurs \nwhen accommodation would create onerous conditions for the University.  \nWhile undue hardship will be decided in the circumstances of each case, \nonerous conditions may include, but are not limited to, the following.  \nWhen the proposed accommodation would: including but not limited to the \nfollowing, should be considered:  \na) pose  when there is a risk to the safety of others or a substantive \nrisk of personal injury to the person seeking accommodation, \nb) entail unreasonable financial cost such that a program or service \nwould cease to exist, or otherwise  be unreasonable for  the \nUniversity to bear the costs of accommodation,  \nc) effectively lower academic and/or when accommodation \nalternatives would result in lowering performance standards or \nresult in substantive job requirements being unmet,  \nd) unduly disrupt or interfere with when the accommodation would be \nunduly disruptive to an academic staff or collective agreement or \ncause substantial detrimental effects on other employees,  \ne) When an educational accommodation would result in essential \nelements of an educational service or program not being offered to \nother students, or cause a detrimental effect on other students. as \na result of accommodating an individual or a group of students.  \nAll students are bound by the Code of Student Behaviour.  \nInformal Resolution Informal resolutions are those that achieve remedies agreeable to complainants and respondents, but do not invoke formal resolution \nprocedures.

Applies to both staff and \nstudents. \n U of A Policies and Procedures On-Line (UAPPOL) \nDEFINITIONS \nAny definitions listed in the following table apply to this document only with no implied or intended \ninstitution-wide use. [▲Top] \nMembers of the University \nCommunity \nAll employees, (including but not limited to, academic staff, support staff \nand administrators), adjunct professors, professors emeriti, lecturers, \nclinical staff, all students (including undergraduate students and graduate \nstudents), and post-doctoral fellows.  \nDiscrimination A distinction, whether or not intentional, based on a characteristic or perceived characteristic referenced in the Protected Grounds that has the \neffect of imposing on an individual or group of individuals burdens, \nobligations or disadvantages that are not imposed on others, or of \nwithholding or limiting access to opportunities, benefits and advantages \navailable to other individuals in society.  \nHarassment Conduct or comment, either one-time or repeated that:   \na) is demeaning, intimidating, threatening, or abusive; and  \nb) is not trivial or fleeting in nature; and  \nc) causes offence and should have reasonably been expected to \noffend; and  \nd) serves no legitimate purpose for the work, study or living \nenvironment, and  \ne) undermines authority or respect in the work, study or living \nenvironment, or impairs work or learning performance, or limits \nopportunities for advancement or the pursuit of education or \nresearch, or creates an intimidating, hostile or offensive work or \nlearning environment.  \nHarassment includes bullying, which is a form of aggression that may \ninclude physical, verbal, or emotional abuse. Bullying poisons the work, \nstudy or living environment of the person it targets. It can include \npersistent, offensive, abusive, intimidating or insulting behavior, abuse of \npower, and/or unfair sanctions which make the individual feel threatened, \nhumiliated, and/or vulnerable.  \nSexual Harassment may be broadly defined as unwelcome conduct or \ncomment of a sexual nature which detrimentally affects the work, study or \nliving environment or otherwise leads to adverse consequences for the \ntarget of the harassment.  \nIt may consist of unwanted sexual attention, sexually oriented remarks or \nbehaviours, or the creation of a negative psychological and emotional \nenvironment based on gender, gender identity or sexual orientation. It may \nbe an isolated act or repetitive conduct, but cannot be trifling. A reprisal or \nthreat of reprisal against an individual for rejecting a sexual solicitation or \nadvance may also constitute sexual harassment. \nThe person(s) engaged in harassment need not have the intention to \nharass; it is the objective assessment of the circumstances that matters. \nHow would a reasonable observer perceive the situation? A complainant \nneed not expressly object to unwelcome conduct or comments, although \nany clear indication that the behaviour is unwanted will satisfy the test. A \ncomplainant's apparent passivity or failure to object overtly to sexual \nadvances does not necessarily signal consent or welcomed behaviour, \nespecially where a power imbalance exists between the individuals.  \nRacial Harassment involves unwanted or unwelcome comments, conduct \n U of A Policies and Procedures On-Line (UAPPOL) \nor behavior that humiliates, intimidates, excludes or isolates an individual \nor group by focusing on their race, ethnicity, origin or religion. Overall, \nracial harassment undermines self-esteem and is a violation of the dignity \nand security of the individual or group(s) that it targets. \nInformal Resolution Those resolutions that achieve remedies agreeable to respondents and complainants, but do not invoke formal resolution procedures. Informal \nresolutions involve the relevant parties and many include coaching, \ncounseling, supporting, mediating or otherwise facilitating the resolution of \nthe complaint.  \nFormal Resolution Resolutions effected through procedures described in the disciplinary clauses or grievance procedures of the University’s academic staff \nagreements or collective agreement or with AASUA and NASA, in the \nCode of Student Behaviour, in the Postdoctoral Fellows Policy, or in other \nprocedures linked to the Discrimination, Harassment and Duty to \nAccommodate Policy.  \nNatural Justice The University of Alberta strives to ensure that the principles of natural justice, as summarized below, apply to the adjudication of disputes \nbetween persons or organizations. For a full outline of the principles and \nhow they are applied, employees should consult their applicable collective \nor academic staff agreement and students should consult the Code of \nStudent Behaviour.  \nThe principles of natural justice include:  \na) members of the University are entitled to representation by the \nAssociation to which they belong (AAS:UA, NASA, GSA, SU) or, \nin the case of students, to receive advice from by the Student \nOmbudService Office of the Student Ombuds (OSO), Student \nLegal Services or other student advisors during any stage of the \nprocess,  \nb) respondents have the right to know the identity of the complainant \nand details of a complaint,  \nc) investigations will normally be completed in a timely manner,  \nd) complainants, respondents and witnesses will have protection \nfrom reprisals,  \ne) complainants and respondents will have the opportunity to present \ninformation in support of their positions and to defend themselves \nagainst allegations, and  \nf) complainants and respondents have the right to receive \nclarification of the investigator’s findings, if needed.  \nUnless otherwise noted in the applicable collective or academic staff \nagreement or the Code of Student Behaviour, this policy does not confer \nany rights upon complainants or respondents to examine or cross-examine \nwitnesses.  \nComplainant  a. A person who believes they or another person have experienced \nbeen a victim of discrimination or harassment and initiates a \ncomplaint, or  \nb.

Seeking such advice as is necessary, they will determine \nwhether accommodation can be made at an institutional level.  \nIf it is determined that other avenues of complaint/appeal would be more appropriate, guidance will be \navailable from the Office of Safe Disclosure and Human Rights or Student OmbudService on any internal or \nexternal options. \nDEFINITIONS \nAny definitions listed in the following table apply to this document only with no implied or intended \ninstitution-wide use. [▲Top] \nMembers of the University \nCommunity \nAll employees, (including but not limited to, academic staff, support staff \nand administrators), adjunct professors, professors emeriti, lecturers, \nclinical staff, all students (including undergraduate students and graduate \nstudents), and post-doctoral fellows.  \nAccommodation \nAccommodation is the process of making reasonable adjustments to the \ndelivery of services and the conditions of employment in order to reduce or \neliminate the impact of discriminatory rules, policies, practices, standards, \nterms of employment, or decisions, which have an adverse impact on an \nindividual or group of individuals based on a characteristic or perceived \ncharacteristic referenced in the Protected Grounds. Accommodation is a \nshared responsibility between the University and the individual in need of \naccommodation, and is assessed on the unique circumstances of each \nindividual. The process requires reasonable accommodation, not instant or \nperfect accommodation. The recipients of accommodation (e.g. students \nand staff) may be required to try different accommodation options. The \nUniversity is required to provide reasonable accommodation up to the \npoint of undue hardship.  \nAccommodation of students neither requires nor implies that the University \nlower its academic standards. Nor does accommodation relieve the \nstudent of that student’s responsibility to develop the essential skills and \ncompetencies required by programs. Accommodation neither requires nor \nimplies that the University lower its academic or professional standards. \nNor does accommodation relieve students of the responsibility to \ndemonstrate the essential skills and competencies required by programs \nor staff of the responsibility to meet the performance requirements of a \nposition in which they are accommodated. \nUndue Hardship \nThe University has a duty to take reasonable steps to accommodate \nindividual needs to the point of undue hardship. Undue hardship occurs \nwhen accommodation would create onerous conditions for the University.  \nWhile undue hardship will be decided in the circumstances of each case, \nonerous conditions, including but not limited to the following, should be \nconsidered:  \na) when there is a risk to the safety of others or a substantive risk of \npersonal injury to the person seeking accommodation.  \nb) when financial cost is such that a program or service would cease \nto exist due to the financial burden of the accommodation, or other \ncircumstances where it would be unreasonable to expect the \nUniversity to bear the costs of accommodation.  \nc) When accommodation alternatives would result in lowering \nperformance standards or in substantive job requirements being \n U of A Policies and Procedures On-Line (UAPPOL) \nunmet.  \nd) When the accommodation would be unduly disruptive to an \nacademic staff or collective agreement or cause substantial \ndetrimental effect on other employees.  \ne) When an educational accommodation would result in essential \nelements of a service or a program not being offered to other \nstudents, or cause a detrimental effect on other students, as a \nresult of accommodating an individual or a group of students.  \nAll students are bound by the Code of Student Behaviour. \nAccommodation of students neither requires nor implies that the University \nlower its standards nor does accommodation relieve the student of their \nresponsibility to develop the essential skills and competencies required by \nprograms.  \nBona fide requirement (BFR) / \nBona fide occupational \nrequirement (BFOR) \nA limitation on individual rights may be reasonable and justifiable if the \nuniversity can show that a discriminatory practice, standard, decision or \nrule is a “bona fide requirement” (BFR) or “bona fide occupational \nrequirement” (BFOR). To justify such a determination, the University must \ndemonstrate, on a balance of probabilities, that the impugned practice, \nstandard, decision or rule:  \na) was adopted for a rational purpose connected to the performance of \nthe job or the provision of the service;  \nb) was adopted in an honest and good faith belief that it was \nnecessary to the fulfillment of the job or service;  \nc) is reasonable and necessary to the fulfillment of the job or service.  \nDuty to Accommodate \nThe duty to accommodate obligates the University to make reasonable \nadjustments, to the point of undue hardship or as required by law, to the \ndelivery of services (including teaching and the method of evaluation) and \nthe conditions of employment in order to reduce or eliminate the impact of \ndiscriminatory rules, policies, practices, standards, terms of employment, \nor decisions, which have an adverse impact on an individual or group of \nindividuals based on a characteristic or perceived characteristic referenced \nin the Protected Grounds.  \nProtected Grounds \nDiscrimination is prohibited based on the following protected grounds:  \na) race  \nb) colour  \nc) ancestry  \nd) place of origin  \ne) religious beliefs  \nf) gender, gender expression and gender identity (including \npregnancy and gender identity)  \ng) physical disability  \nh) mental disability  \ni) marital status  \nj) family status  \nk) source of income  \nl) sexual orientation  \nm) age  \nn) political beliefs;  \nor any other groups as amended from time to time.  \nProtected Areas Discrimination is prohibited in the following protected areas: \na) employment  \nb) tenancy  \nc) access to goods and services \nd) access to accommodations or facilities customarily available to \n U of A Policies and Procedures On-Line (UAPPOL) \nmembers of the public \nDiscrimination \nA distinction, whether or not intentional, based on a characteristic or \nperceived characteristic referenced in the Protected Grounds that has the \neffect of imposing on an individual or group of individuals burdens, \nobligations or disadvantages that are not imposed on others, or of \nwithholding or limiting access to opportunities, benefits and advantages \navailable to other individuals in society.  \nRELATED LINKS \nShould a link fail, please contact uappol@ualberta.ca.

Recognizing At \nRisk Behaviour and responding with interest and concern are critical factors in preventing potential \nviolence (including harm to self, others and University property). The objective of this Policy is to create a \nsystem that will allow for the gathering of reports of At Risk Behaviour from across the University in order \nto facilitate a “connecting of the dots” of what could otherwise be viewed as isolated and less urgent \nincidents. If the connection between those incidents leads to the conclusion that an individual is in need of \nassistance, the existing support systems in place for members of the University community would work \nwith the Individual at Risk in an effort to provide that individual with the assistance required and \ntherefore minimize the possibility of a situation escalating. \nIt is important to recognize that the University also has systems in place for dealing with disciplinary \nmatters (e.g. The Code of Student Behaviour and the various collective agreements), and for dealing with \ncases of imminent danger (e.g. The Protocol for Urgent Cases of Disruptive, Threatening or Violent \nConduct (GFC Policy 91) and the Emergency Management PlanOffice). \nPurpose \nThe purpose of this policy is to facilitate early identification of At Risk Behaviour and create a system \ndesigned to receive and consolidate reports of At Risk Behaviour. Consolidating reports of At Risk \nBehaviour will enable a team to identifyidentification of situations in which seemingly isolated incidents \nare, in fact, connected so that the At Risk Behaviour can be properly assessed and the Individual At Risk \noffered assistance when deemed appropriate. Doing so should result in increased mental wellness and/or \na decreased risk of violence and at the same time reduce the likelihood of matters escalating.  \nThis policy also offers an opportunity for concerned members of the University Community to report At \nRisk Behaviour.  \nhttps://policiesonline.ualberta.ca/policiesprocedures/policies/recruitment-policy.pdf\nhttps://policiesonline.ualberta.ca/policiesprocedures/procedures/recruitment-policy-appendix-a-definition-and-categories-of-academic-staff-and-colleagues.pdf\nhttps://policiesonline.ualberta.ca/policiesprocedures/procedures/recruitment-policy-appendix-b-definition-and-categories-of-support-staff.pdf\n  U of A Policies and Procedures On-Line (UAPPOL) \nPOLICY \n1. The University will have an Individuals at Risk Case Team. Its mandate is to promote early \nidentification of At Risk Behaviour, encourage reporting of such behaviour to the appropriate Support \nUnit or the Case Team Coordinator, receive and consolidate those reports, and, if help is not already \nbeing provided, refer the matter to the appropriate Support UnitThe University will have a system for \nidentifying Individuals At Risk.  \n2. The Individuals At Risk Case Team is responsible for the education of the communityUniversity will \nwork proactively to educate students, staff, faculty and post-doctoral fellows on recognizing and \nsupporting Individuals at Risk, and on this policy and related procedure. This mandate would include \nproviding specialized training to key positions in the Support Units.  \n3. The Individuals at Risk Case Team will develop and maintain recordRecord retention protocols which \nare in alignment with the Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy (FOIPP) Act and existing \nUniversity policies will be maintained. \n4. When information gathered in the course of administration of this Policy is more appropriately \naddressed through the Protocol for Urgent Cases of Disruptive, Threatening or Violent Conduct, the \ninformation will be referred to the appropriate party as set out in the Protocol.General Faculty Council \nManual Protocol 91. The files under this policy and procedure will not be used in any other University \nprocess except the Protocol. \n5.
