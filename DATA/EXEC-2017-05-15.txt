There have been no students registered in either major since \nthe University of Alberta began officially maintaining the Augustana \nFaculty student records in September 2006.    \nReplaces/Revises (eg, policies, \nresolutions) \nWill require removal of the programs and all references to the programs \nfrom the University Calendar: Augustana Faculty Bachelor of Music \nsection. \nTimeline/Implementation Date Termination to take effect upon approval. Program will be removed from \nthe 2018-2019 University Calendar. \nEstimated Cost and funding \nsource \nN/A \nNext Steps (ie.: \nCommunications Plan, \nImplementation plans) \nFormal Calendar change will be implemented upon approval.  \nAfter approval by the Board of Governors, the proposal will be submitted \nto the Ministry of Advanced Education for approval.  \nSupplementary Notes and \ncontext \nSince September 2006, no students have been registered in either of the \nLiturgical Arts or Musical Arts BMus majors offered by Augustana \nFaculty. \nOfficial student reporting by the University to the Government of Alberta \ndoes show 3 students registered in the Musical Arts Major from 2006-\n2016.  However, close examination determined all 3 were actually \nUndeclared majors who were reported as Musical Arts majors due to the \nreporting requirements stipulated by the Government of Alberta.  The \nlast reported Musical Arts major was in 2010. \nGiven the lack of registrations in these majors, consultation with the \nOffice of the Provost and Vice President (Academic) and the \nGovernment of Alberta recommended moving forward with the \ntermination of these majors, without a period of suspension. \nItem No. 7 \nGFC EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE \nFor the Meeting of May 15, 2017 \nEngagement and Routing (Include meeting dates) \nParticipation: \n(parties who have seen the \nproposal and in what capacity) \n<For further information see \nthe link posted on \nthe Governance Toolkit section \nStudent Participation Protocol> \nThose who have been informed: \n• Wide ranging discussions in Summer/Fall of 2016 on Augustana \nFaculty within the Music division, Department of Fine Arts and \nHumanities, Augustana Dean’s Office, Augustana Prospective \nStudents Office, Augustana Learning, Advising & Beyond Office, \nAugustana Registrar’s Office. \nThose who have been consulted: \n• Karsten Mündel, Augustana Associate Dean, Academic, \nDecember 11, 2015 \n• Jonathan Hawkins, Assistant Registrar, Augustana Campus, \nNovember 9, 2016 \n• Kate Peters, Office of the Provost Portfolio Initiatives Manager, \nNovember 23, 2016 \n• Department of Fine Arts and Humanities Meeting, January 9. \n2017 \n• Augustana Curriculum Committee Meeting, January 12, 2017 \nThose who are actively participating: \n• Milton Schlosser, Professor of Music and Director of Music, \nAugustana Faculty \n• Augustana Music Division – regular consultation with all Music \ninstructors, staff, and students at Augustana Faculty in Spring, \nSummer, Fall, 2016. \n• Augustana Music Division meeting to propose termination of \nmajors, November 14, 2016 \nApproval Route (Governance) \n(including meeting dates) \nAugustana Faculty Council – February 6, 2017  \nGFC Academic Planning Committee – April 19, 2017  \nGFC Executive Committee – May 15, 2017 \nGeneral Faculties Council – June 5, 2017 \nBoard Learning and Discovery Committee – Fall 2017 \nBoard of Governors – Fall 2017  \nFinal Approver Board of Governors \nAlignment/Compliance \nAlignment with Guiding \nDocuments \nFor the Public Good  \nGOAL: SUSTAIN our people, our work, and the environment by \nattracting and stewarding the resources we need to deliver excellence to \nthe benefit of all.  \nObjective 21: Encourage continuous improvement in administrative, \ngovernance, planning, and stewardship systems, procedures, and \npolicies that enable students, faculty, staff, and the institution as a whole \nto achieve shared strategic goals. \nCompliance with Legislation, \nPolicy and/or Procedure \nRelevant to the Proposal \n(please quote legislation and \ninclude identifying section \nnumbers) \n1.

Rationale for suspension (for example, changes in applications, enrolment, employer \ndemand, program obsolescence, etc.).  Comment on the alignment of the proposed change \nwith the institution’s strategic direction and priorities.  If enrolment is a key rationale, \nprovide historical enrolment data. \n2. Anticipated impacts on students and graduates and plans to ameliorate these impacts.  \nDescribe the institution’s plan to teach out active students and stop-outs.  Include evidence \nof consultation with students and a communications plan for informing stopped-out \nstudents of the change. \n3. Identify anticipated impacts on external stakeholders (e.g. employers, professional/ \nregulatory organizations, other post-secondary institutions) and provide evidence of \nconsultation. \n4.

Comment on the alignment of the proposed change with the \ninstitution’s strategic direction and priorities. \n2. Identify anticipated impacts on institutional operations and resources (e.g. operating \nbudget, staffing, student services, information technology, library, and classroom and lab \nspace). \n3.

Describe measures taken by the institution to ensure that active students and stop-outs have \nhad ample opportunity to complete their programs of study. \nNo student has been registered in either the Augustana Bachelor of Music Liturgical Arts \nmajor or Musical Arts major since the University of Alberta began officially maintaining \nthe Augustana Faculty student records in September 2006.   Official student headcounts \nreported to the Government of Alberta by the University indicate no students registered in \nLiturgical Arts since 2006.  Three Musical Arts registrations were reported (1 each in 2006, \n2007, and 2010); however, close examination determined all 3 were actually Undeclared \nstudents who were reported as being Musical Arts majors due to reporting requirements.  \nThe students reported in 2006 and 2007 subsequently graduated from the University of \nAlberta – Augustana Faculty with different BMus majors; the student reported in 2010 \nwithdrew from the program after the Fall 2010 and has not returned to the University. If \nthis student returns, as an Undeclared major, she can still choose between the remaining \nBMus majors offered by Augustana Faculty - Comprehensive, Piano, and Voice - and \nwould not even notice the change in offerings.  As such, there are no active students or \nstop-outs eligible for these majors. \nThe Augustana Fine Arts and Humanities Department has informed the Augustana \nProspective Students Office of the intention to terminate these majors.  Historically, there \nhas been no demand for registration in these programs, but in the highly unlikely event of \nan applicant requesting consideration for either major in the current admission cycle, such \nan applicant would be directed into one of the three remaining BMus majors offered by \nAugustana Faculty – Comprehensive, Piano, or Voice. \n2. Where applicable, summarize the actual re-allocation of resources during the period of \nsuspension, and any additional re-allocation anticipated upon termination, and specify the \nimpacts of re-allocation on institutional operations.   \nUpon recommendation of the Office of the Provost and Vice President (Academic) in \nconsultation with the Government of Alberta, Augustana Faculty proposes to terminate \nboth majors without a period of suspension.  The lack of registration in either major results \nin no resources available for reallocation, but does allow for a clarity of opportunity and \nresourcing for the remaining three majors in the Augustana BMus program. \nAppendix 1: 2018/19 Calendar Changes for Augustana Faculty \nCurrent (2017-18 Calendar Entry Proposed (2018-19) Calendar Entry \nBachelor of Music (BMus) \n[Augustana] \nOverview \nThe Bachelor of Music program consists of \n★122, including ★65 of core music \nrequirements, ★24 in one of the five Bachelor \nof Music majors, and ★33 of non-music \nrequirements. In two of these majors, Liturgical \nArts and Musical Arts, a minor is required; in \nthe other three majors, Piano, Voice, and \nComprehensive, a minor is optional. The minor \nconsists of a minimum of ★18 in one discipline \nor approved interdisciplinary area, including at \nleast ★12 at the senior level. A student should \nbe aware that it may not be possible to complete \ncertain combinations of majors and minors \nwithout extending the time required to earn the \ndegree. \nResidence Requirement \nStudents registered in a BMus program must \ncomplete at least 60 senior credits offered by the \nAugustana Faculty. However, \n1.  Language or other study abroad may, \nwith special permission of the Associate \nDean, Academics, count toward the \nresidence requirement \n2.  An exception to this may be granted to \nstudents already holding a BA or BSc who \ncan transfer sufficient credits from their first \ndegree to be able to complete the \nrequirements of the Bachelor of Music \ndegree in fewer than ★60. Normally in such \ncases at least the final ★45 must be \ncompleted at Augustana. \nGeneral Information \nFive majors are available in the Bachelor of \nMusic degree program: Piano, Voice, \nComprehensive, Liturgical Arts, Musical Arts: \nBachelor of Music (BMus) \n[Augustana] \nOverview \nThe Bachelor of Music program consists of \n★122, including ★65 of core music \nrequirements, ★24 in one of the three Bachelor \nof Music majors, and ★33 of non-music \nrequirements. A minor is optional in all three \nmajors. The minor consists of a minimum of \n★18 in one discipline or approved \ninterdisciplinary area, including at least ★12 at \nthe senior level.

Professional employment \nas, for example, a soloist, chorister, \naccompanist, chamber musician, or teacher, is a \npossibility for a graduate seeking a career as a \nmusic performer. Along with independent \nfreelance career opportunities, a degree with \neither of these majors can also lead to a career as \nprofessor in music performance in a college, \nuniversity, or conservatory. These majors \nrequire high artistic standards, include courses \nspecific to piano and voice in literature and \npedagogy, and provide for a broadly-based \nmusic education with advanced studies in music \ntheory and music history. Four years of \nensembles (choral/instrumental and chamber) \nare required. \nComprehensive \nA student who seeks intensive studies in an \ninstrument or voice, variety in music options, \nand advanced studies in music history, theory, \nand ensembles, should consider this major. It is \nsuitable for the student desiring to prepare for a \ncareer as, for example, a professional wind, \nbrass, or string player, a choral or instrumental \nconductor, an arts administrator, or a \nprofessional librarian. Like the Bachelor of Arts \ndegree in music, this major enables the student \nto enter graduate studies in more specific fields \nsuch as music theory, music history, \nethnomusicology, and popular music studies. If \nthe student enrols in third- and fourth-year \nrecital courses, this degree may facilitate entry \ninto performance-based graduate programs as \nwell. \nLiturgical Arts \nA student considering professional employment \nas a church musician, or considering graduate \nstudies, may designate this major at the end of \nthe second year of full-time studies (or part-time \nequivalent).

It provides for a liberalized \ncurriculum that combines the strong \nperformance emphasis and scholarly breadth of \na Bachelor of Music, the requirements for a \nminor in another discipline, and interdisciplinary \nresearch on the relationships between the two \ndisciplines. This is the most unique and \n“cutting-edge” of the Bachelor of Music majors. \nA student may apply for this major at the end of \ntwo-years - full-time study or part-time \nequivalent. \nAdmission Requirements \nSee Augustana Faculty.
