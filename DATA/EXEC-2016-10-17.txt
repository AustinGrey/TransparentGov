Closed to web registration. \nRegistration is recommended to the FGSR by the \nstudent’s home unit. \nAGRMT 900 Formal Agreement Registration  \n*3 (fi 0) (either term, unassigned)  \nThis course is reserved for University of Alberta \ngraduate students participating in an approved \nprogram administered under a formal \nagreement between the University of Alberta \nand other institution(s), who wish to maintain \npart-time registration at the University of \nAlberta while studying at an approved partner \ninstitution. Closed to web registration. \nRegistration is recommended to the FGSR by the \nstudent’s home unit. \nAGRMT 903 Formal Agreement Registration  \n*3 (fi 0) (either term, unassigned)  \nThis course is reserved for University of Alberta \ngraduate students participating in an approved \nprogram administered under a formal \nagreement between the University of Alberta \nand other institution(s), who wish to maintain \npart-time registration at the University of \nAlberta while studying at an approved partner \ninstitution. Closed to web registration. \nRegistration is recommended to the FGSR by the \nstudent’s home unit. \n1 \nJustification:    \nCreating AGRMT 906: currently the only full-time option is registration in AGRMT 909 (*9). This course \nworks for registration in Fall and Winter terms. For Spring and Summer terms the student is only required \nto register in *6 to be considered full-time. Using AGRMT 909 for Spring and Summer term registration \nresults in the assessment of extra tuition fees which have to be manually waived. AGRMT 906 (*6) would \nassess the correct tuition fees. This would be scheduled for Spring and Summer terms only.  \nRenumber AGRMT 900 to 903: This aligns it with the Catalog Numbers for thesis courses (THES) where \nthe Catalog Number, for the most part, reflects the course weight (example, THES 903 = *3). AGRMT 909 \n(*9) would be used for full-time registration during Fall and Winter terms. AGRMT 906 (*6) would be used \nfor full-time registration during Spring and Summer terms. AGRMT 903 (*3) in any term. Although GFC \nPolicy indicates that you cannot renumber to the same level, this change is intended to make it easier for \nstaff and students to recognize the correct course to use. \nItem No. 6 \nGFC EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE \nFor the Meeting of October 17, 2016 \nOUTLINE OF ISSUE \nAdvice, Discussion, Information Item  \nAgenda Title: For the Public Good: Preliminary Recommendations for Performance Indicators \nItem   \nProposed by Mary Persson (AVP, Audit and Analysis) \nPresenter Mary Persson (AVP, Audit and Analysis) and Logan Mardhani-Bayne \n(Initiatives Manager, Audit and Analysis) \nDetails \nResponsibility Office of the President \nThe Purpose of the item is \n(please be specific) \nIn July 2016, the university established an advisory group to recommend \na framework for reporting on performance against For the Public Good \n(FPG).

FPG Performance Indicators Advisory Group – membership (1 page) \nPrepared by: Logan Mardhani-Bayne (Initiatives Manager, Audit and Analysis) \nFor the Public Good (FPG): \nPreliminary Recommendations for Performance Indicators \nhttps://www.ualberta.ca/strategic-plan  \nDRAFT presented for consultation \nIntroduction \nIn July 2016, the university established an advisory group to recommend a framework for reporting on \nperformance against For the Public Good (FPG). This document presents preliminary recommendations for \ninput by the campus community.  \nPrinciples for performance indicators: \nIn June 2016, the President’s Executive Committee – Strategic (PEC-S) endorsed the following principles: \n• a focused, manageable framework that blends quantitative and qualitative indicators \n• indicators reflecting outcomes rather than simply activities, where possible \n• integrity and efficiency of data collection \n• relevance of indicators to FPG objectives \n• selection of relevant comparators \n• timely modification of indicators to reflect institutional evolution. \nReporting contexts: \nThe U of A has two primary reporting contexts, each of which warrants distinct indicators: \n• Government (public) reporting: Comprehensive Institutional Plan (CIP), Annual Report (AR).  \no The CIP and Annual Report are based on provincial guidelines, which recommend that \ninstitutions develop approximately 15 performance measures. These tend to be outcome-\nbased, and should present a comprehensive view of the institution’s core functions while \nreflecting current strategic priorities.  \n• Internal indicators: administrative and other Board of Governors reports.  \no These tend to be activity-based indicators, indicators for trend identification, and/or faculty-\nlevel information not suitable for overall institutional reporting. \nThe table on page two provides an overview of recommended indicators for each FPG Goal. Indicators may be \nrelevant to multiple FPG Goals, but each is listed only under the area of most direct relevance. Faculty-level \nbreakdowns can be made available for use by individual units where sufficient data exists. \nThe remainder of this document presents more detailed descriptions of these indicators and existing targets. \nThe examples provided are drawn from existing reports and may not yet reflect the full scope of each \nindicator as described. \nAcronyms: \nNSSE National Survey on Student Engagement - a standardized survey administered by over 500 institutions in \nCanada and the U.S. \nGOS Graduate Outcomes Survey – biennial survey of Alberta post-secondary graduates, conducted two years \npost-graduation \nCGPSS Canadian Graduate and Professional Student Survey – national survey of student satisfaction \nCAST Contract Academic Staff – Teaching \nTRC Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada \nhttps://www.ualberta.ca/strategic-plan\n2 \nOverview of Performance Indicators \nGoal Government (public) reporting Internal indicators FPG Objectives \nBUILD • Composition of faculty and staff \n(gender, indigenous, visible minority, \ndisability status) \n• Composition of student body \n(indigenous and visible minority, % \ninternational, % out of province) \n• Proportion of professoriate at rank of \nAssistant Professors \n• Report on responses to the TRC \n(qualitative) \n• Media impact metrics (mentions, \nreach)1 \n• Student composition by faculty  \n• Professoriate rank composition by \nfaculty (including CAST-to-full-time \nratio) \n• Faculty compensation (gender \ndifferential) \n• International student distribution by \nsource country \n• Student-faculty and graduate-\nundergraduate ratio \n• Average financial support by degree \nlevel (scholarship, grants) \n1.

Citation impact is an important indicator \nof research impact, but no existing citation indicator is comprehensive or equally relevant across \ndisciplines. Reporting will combine multiple indicators (Leiden rankings on number and proportion of \npublications among the 10% most cited in field; normalized citation impact in InCites and SciVal). \nSample (Leiden Rankings) \nCitation impact rankings  \nNumber of publications in top \n10% most cited in field \nProportion of publications in \ntop 10% most cited in field  \nCan. rank World rank Can. rank World rank \n 4 48 14 330 \nSource: CWTS Leiden Rankings \n• Student-reported experience with faculty (seniors) \nObjective 14: Support excellence in teaching and learning \nNSSE surveys students on two Experiences with Faculty indicators. Mean scores reflect the frequency \nwith which students reported positive items in each indicator category. If this indicator is retained, an \nappropriate visualization will be developed. \n8 \nSample (2014 NSSE) \nStudent-faculty \ninteraction \n Mean score \nU of A 17.7 \nU15 17.2 \nEffective teaching \npractices \nU of A 36.6 \nU15 34.8 \nSource: NSSE 2014 \nNote: Each indicator is scored on a 60-point scale. To produce an indicator score, the response set for each item is \nconverted to a 60-point scale (e.g., Never = 0; Sometimes = 20; Often = 40; Very often = 60), and the rescaled items \nare averaged. Thus a score of zero means a student responded at the bottom of the scale for every item, while a \nscore of 60 indicates responses at the top of the scale on every item. \nStudent-faculty interaction includes: discussing career plans; working with faculty on activities other than \ncoursework; discussing course concepts outside of class; discussing academic performance.  \nEffective teaching practices includes: clear course goals and requirements; organized course sessions; use of \nexamples/illustrations; providing feedback on work in progress; providing feedback on completed work. \nInternal indicators: \n• Rankings (THE and QS – overall and subject-\narea) \n• Research and teaching awards (key external \nawards) \n• Faculty and staff training opportunities available \n(Gold College, Chairs’ school  and other programs \nas developed) \n• Funding profile of post-doctoral fellows (under \ndevelopment \nENGAGE \nPrimary indicators attempt to capture the impact of engagement on student development, communities and \ninstitutional reputation.

It will seek your support and advice \nfor making progress on the aspirational goals and strategies that will \nguide the campus sustainability initiative to the year 2020. \nTo place this document on the GFC agenda for November 21. \nTimeline/Implementation Date 2016-2020 \nSupplementary Notes and \ncontext \nBackground: Sustainability is increasingly at the forefront of agendas \nfor local, provincial and national governments, as well as higher \neducation. In 2008, the Board of Governors endorsed the institution’s \nsustainability commitment and guiding principles, the creation of the \ncampus sustainability initiative and the launch of the Office of \nSustainability.  \nThe University of Alberta has recently reaffirmed its commitment to \nadvance sustainability through For the Public Good. A new sustainability \nplan has been developed for 2016-2020 as well as a companion \ndocument to inform academic planning. The new sustainability plan \noutlines areas for improving our institution’s sustainability performance \nand educational programming. It will be used to help guide strategic \ndecisions across the institution, program decisions regarding outreach \ninitiatives, operational improvements and enhancements to academic \nprograms. \nThe University of Alberta has a growing positive reputation for being a \nleader enabling the sustainability transformation in higher education in \nCanada and beyond. As a result of the goals and strategies outlined in \nthe 2012 – 2016 Sustainability Plan, the University of Alberta moved to \na Gold Rating (2014) from a Silver Rating (2012) in the Sustainability \nTracking, Assessment & Rating System. We have also been \nrecognized as one of Canada’s Greenest Employers for 8 consecutive \nyears. \nEngagement and Routing (Include meeting dates) \nItem No. 7 \nGFC EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE \nFor the Meeting of October 17, 2016 \nParticipation: \n(parties who have seen the \nproposal and in what capacity) \n<For further information see \nthe link posted on the \nGovernance Toolkit section \nStudent Participation Protocol> \nThose who have been informed: \n• The President’s Executive Committee – Operations (PEC-O) was \ninformed about the process on December 11, 2014. \n• Advisory committees were engaged in a review of the \nconsultation process in the spring of 2015. \n• The draft document was developed using an iterative \nconsultation and document review process involving those \nidentified as being “consulted”. \n• Reviews were coordinated through senior administration prior to \nthe final document being brought forward for approval at PEC-O \nbut the VP F&O and Deputy Provost \n• GFC Facilities Development Committee – September 22, 2016 \n• GFC Academic Planning Committee – September 28, 2016 \n• GFC Committee on the Learning Environment – October 5, 2016 \n• GFC Executive Committee – October 17, 2016 \n• General Faculties Council – November 21, 2016 \n• Board Learning and Discovery Committee \nThose who have been consulted: \nFacilitated Workshops, March – April 2015 \n• Waste Management Systems (Feb. 6;

The city’s strategic plan contains six 10-year strategic goals supported by directional plans. The plans are collectively \nknown as “The Way Ahead”. These plans have a major connection to sustainability addressing topics like: infrastructure, transit, \nenvironmental sustainability, resilience, energy transition, and healthy living. The City of Edmonton recently advertised to fill the role of \nCorporate Sustainability Officer to lead their efforts.  \nGovernment of Alberta. The 2016-2019 Strategic Plan has five priorities including demonstrating leadership on climate change through \ninitiatives like waste diversion, environmental stewardship, sustainable agriculture practices, and more. They are planning progress on \nsocial sustainability – building safe and inclusive communities. The Alberta Climate Change Office has been established to implement \nthe Climate Leadership Plan. \nGovernment of Canada. The 2016-2019 Federal Sustainable Development Strategy sets the federal government’s vision for a more \nsustainable Canada. The draft strategy highlights 5 sustainability goals with a strong emphasis on taking action on climate change, \nclean technology, connecting Canadians to nature, and protecting and restoring ecosystems. Recently the Strategic Innovation Fund \nwas released, providing up to $2 billion to improve scale or quality of facilities used for research and innovation and their environmental \nsustainability. It also acknowledges that this strategy can help support the role of the 2030 Agenda’s Sustainable Development Goals.  \nInternational Initiatives. The UN Sustainable Development Goals (officially known as Transforming our world: the 2030 Agenda \nfor Sustainable Development) are an intergovernmental set of 17 aspiration Goals with 169 targets. This plan of action for people, \nplanet and prosperity was adopted by the General Assembly (including Canada) on September 25, 2015. This was followed by Agenda \n21 which developed the concept of Education for Sustainable Development (ESD) – promoting sustainability educational policy and \npractice. These two initiatives emphasized the growing need for sustainability awareness in higher education. UAlberta has not been \ninvolved international initiatives.  \nSustainability in Higher Education \nIn 1990, the Talloires Declaration is the first official statement from higher education. Over 350 university and college \npresidents/chancellors in over forty countries have committed their institutions to sustainability (39 Canadian institutions have signed).  \nUAlberta is not a signatory.  \nIn the past decade, sustainability efforts in higher education have become more prevalent in Canada and around the world. UAlberta \nwas a signatory to the following initiatives which seek to advance sustainability in post-secondary institutions globally: \n2010. Statement of Action. G8 University Summit, Vancouver, Canada | Link \n2009. Turin Declaration. G8 University Summit, Torino, Italy | Link \n2008. Sapporo Sustainability Declaration, G8 University Summit, Sapporo. Japan | Link \nWithin North America the Association for the Advancement of Sustainability in Higher Education leads the sustainability transformation \nin higher education. UAlberta has been a member of AASHE since 2008. Our Chief Sustainability Officer is the first Canadian to serve \non their board. There are several other international organizations helping integrate sustainability into higher education of which \nUAlberta is not a member: \n• Association of University Leaders for a Sustainable Future (ULSF) \n• International Sustainable Campus Network (ISCN) \n• Higher Education Sustainability Initiative (HESI) \nSubmission By:  Trina Innes     \nPosition Title:  Chief Sustainability Officer \nDate: 2016-08-25 \nPage 1 of 2 \nhttp://www.edmonton.ca/city_government/city_vision_and_strategic_plan/the-way-ahead.aspx\nhttp://finance.alberta.ca/publications/budget/budget2016/goa-strategic-plan.pdf\nhttp://www.alberta.ca/climate-leadership-plan.aspx\nhttp://fsds-sfdd.ca/index.html%23/en\nhttps://www.ic.gc.ca/eic/site/051.nsf/eng/h_00002.html\nhttps://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/?menu=1300\nhttps://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/post2015/transformingourworld\nhttps://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/post2015/transformingourworld\nhttp://www.ulsf.org/talloires_declaration.html\nhttp://president.ubc.ca/files/2010/05/g8_signeddoc1.pdf\nhttp://iau-hesd.net/sites/default/files/documents/g8torino_declaration.pdf\nhttp://iau-hesd.net/sites/default/files/documents/g8.pdf\nhttp://www.aashe.org/\nhttp://www.ulsf.org/\nhttp://www.international-sustainable-campus-network.org/\nhttps://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/sdinaction/hesi\nSustainability Plan 2016-2020 \nSustainability at UAlberta \nIn 2008, the Board of Governors endorsed the university’s sustainability commitment and guiding principles and the creation of the \nOffice of Sustainability. The Office of Sustainability, under the direction of the chief sustainability officer, is the hub of the university’s \ncampus sustainability initiative. It facilitates a campus-wide network and helps inspire innovations that enhance our institution’s \nsustainability performance.  \nSince 2009, there have been three faculty members appointed to lead academic initiatives. The longest-serving director, appointed in \n2012, championed the Certificate in Sustainability, the Sustainability Scholars program, and the sustainability plan’s companion \ndocument, “A Plan for Deepening Sustainability Education and Scholarship at the University of Alberta: 2016-2020”. In the fall of 2016, \na team of faculty members will pilot a co-leadership approach. \nIn 2011, the office facilitated development of UAlberta’s first sustainability plan. Significant progress was made under the guidance of \nthe first 2012-2016 Sustainability Plan. Since August 2010, UAlberta has been a charter member of the Sustainability Tracking, \nAssessment & Rating System™ (STARS™; stars.aashe.org). In the fall of 2014, UAlberta earned a STARS Gold rating up from a \nSTARS Silver rating in 2012. The university was recognized with an Emerald Award for our waste in residence outreach initiatives, and \nhas been recognized as one of Canada’s Greenest Employers every year since 2009. Our Lister Conference Centre and Guest Suites \nhas earned 4 Green Keys under the Green Key Eco-Rating Program for hotels.  \nSustainability is identified as a major goal in UAlberta’s institutional strategic plan which was informed by the results of the consultation \nframing the new 2016-2020 Sustainability Plan and its companion document “A Plan for Deepening Sustainability Education and \nScholarship at the University of Alberta”. All plans summarize an array of aspirational goals, as well as strategies for attaining these \ngoals, to deepen and broaden sustainability operations, campus engagement and education at UAlberta. The expertise, leadership, \ncollective good will, program and course offerings, research and operations at UAlberta point to an enormous opportunity to inform \nsustainable thinking and practices of the future.  \n2 Issues \nGiven the strong profile of sustainability within society, the related emphasis in local, provincial, national, international governments, \nand the growth in expectations of higher education’s involvement in the movement, UAlberta has an opportunity to be recognized as a \nleader/change agent for sustainability. Work on sustainability will also help make progress on the university’s institutional strategic plan, \nassisting in our recruitment of employees and students, enhancing our reputation, building goodwill with a range of stakeholders, and \nimproving our ability to attract new forms of funding.  \nSome of the challenges associated with continuing to advance the campus sustainability initiative at UAlberta include: \n• Lack of an institution-wide committee with senior representation to inspire innovation \n• Inconsistent engagement of unit leaders in strategic planning and implementation \n• Infusion of sustainability into academic and operational business plans \n• Limited inclusion of sustainability in internal and external corporate communications and high-profile events \n• Leadership turnover  \nTo transition towards sustainability our institution would benefit from treating innovation for sustainability as something to be valued. We \nneed to give leaders permission to invest time to sense what’s emerging in sustainability, to collaborate and pilot new ideas, to resolve \nrisks and perfect ideas so they can be scaled into practice.  \n3 Recommendations \nThe following are recommendations to advance sustainability at UAlberta: \n• Encourage UAlberta’s senior leaders to participate in executive education for sustainability. Opportunities include: Executive \nEducation for Sustainability Leadership- Harvard (4 days), Conference Board of Canada webinars, The Natural Step, \nInternational Society of Sustainability Professionals, etc. Various certificate programs are also available. \n• Establish a campus-wide sustainability committee with senior leaders members from across the institution.  \n• Consider joining International Sustainable Campus Network (ISCN) and/or Higher Education Sustainability Initiative (HESI). \n• Explore President’s interest in joining the Association of University Leaders for a Sustainable Future (ULSF). \n• Advocate for sustainability in higher education with provincial government and pursue inclusion of sustainability in pan-\nCanadian organizations connected to higher education (e.g., U15, AUCC, CMEC, CAUBO, CAUT, etc.). \n• Encourage development of unit-level sustainability plans. \nSubmission By:  Trina Innes     \nPosition Title:  Chief Sustainability Officer \nDate: 2016-08-25 \nPage 2 of 2 \nhttp://www.international-sustainable-campus-network.org/\nhttps://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/sdinaction/hesi\nhttp://www.ulsf.org/\na600 \nAUGUST 2016 \n2016-2020 \nSustainability Plan \nUniversity of Alberta Sustainability Plan 2016-2020  /  Page 2 of 30 \nThe University of Alberta respectfully acknowledges that it is located \non Treaty 6 territory.1 \n1 Footnote: Please note that this is placeholder text to be updated when the University of Alberta‘s institutional \nterritorial statement is finalized by the community \nUniversity of Alberta Sustainability Plan 2016-2020  /  Page 3 of 30 \nTable of Contents \nForeword ...................................................................................................................................................................4 \nIntroduction ...............................................................................................................................................................6 \nSustainability at the University of Alberta .........................................................................................................7 \nPlanning for Sustainability ..................................................................................................................................9 \nObstacles & Opportunities ...................................................................................

We have a responsibility to ourselves, to our neighbours, \nand to the next generation, to set our brightest minds on finding solutions today.  \nWe have an opportunity within this plan to display our hard work and ingenuity to the world. Our path \nleads to clean energy, sustainable food systems, richer thinking and interdisciplinary learning, and \ninclusive communities. This is a path we can take. It is a path we must take.  \nAs we build upon the work and expertise from within this organization, I would like to thank the planning \nteam, facilitators, collaborators and all parties responsible for enacting the strategies in this plan. I have \ngreat confidence in the ability of the faculty, staff and students of this great institution to make the rapid \nprogress we need to see. \nI look forward to working with you in the years ahead in support of accomplishing these goals. \nYours sincerely, \nDavid H. Turpin, CM, PhD, LLD, FRSC \nPresident and Vice-Chancellor \nUniversity of Alberta Sustainability Plan 2016-2020  /  Page 5 of 30 \nNote from the Chief Sustainability Officer \nInspired: this is how I feel about the future of sustainability at the University of Alberta.  \nI joined the University of Alberta in 2009 as the inaugural director of the Office of Sustainability. Since \nthen, I have had the opportunity to work with many leaders championing the campus sustainability \ninitiative across the university. Together, we have accomplished a lot.  \nThe university has made major progress on sustainability, including: introducing an embedded \nsustainability certificate for undergraduate students, accelerating the implementation of the energy \nmanagement program, recognizing spaces for their sustainability actions, launching our greenhouse \ngas management plan, and growing engagement of students, faculty and staff in sustainability \ninitiatives. Together we have achieved a Gold Rating in the Sustainability Tracking, Assessment and \nRating System™—an accomplishment to be very proud of.  \nAs we move beyond thinking solely about organizational efficiencies, people are recognizing the \ninterconnections of sustainability. We are thinking about the environment and the economy, and \nexpanding our thinking to include aspects of justice, health, well-being and other values. More and \nmore people are embracing their role as change agents and working together to integrate sustainability \ninto the culture of our institution.  \nThroughout the development of this plan, we have listened to the campus community, improved our \nunderstanding of the challenges and opportunities before us, and sought out ways to collaborate and \nimprove our institution’s position as a national model for sustainability.  \nWhether you’re interested in taking courses, getting involved in hands-on learning experiences, piloting \nnew ideas, or conducting research using our campus as a living lab, there are many ways for you to \nparticipate in this plan and develop innovative solutions that better the planet. Together our students, \nfaculty and staff have the talents needed to advance our sustainability ambitions and to develop \ntomorrow’s sustainability leaders.  \nI am looking forward to working with you as we gain fresh momentum towards building a sustainable \nfuture!  \nTrina Innes, MF, MBA, ICD.D \nChief Sustainability Officer \nUniversity of Alberta Sustainability Plan 2016-2020  /  Page 6 of 30 \nIntroduction \nWe are living in a world that is changing rapidly. Patterns of development and consumption are \ndegrading the global resource base and reducing the quality of physical and social environments. \nGovernments, business, organizations and academic institutions are all recognizing that the imperative \nof taking actions to develop a sustainable society. \nSustainability is about meeting the needs of the world without compromising the ability of future \ngenerations to meet their needs. It requires holistic approaches that strive to achieve balance between \necological, social and economic environments in perpetuity. There is no single blueprint for \nsustainability. Every nation, city, organization and individual needs to understand and respond to the \nunique pressures they face from climate change, resource scarcity, pollution, and other issues related \nto local capacity, economics, social justice, health and well-being. Sustainability moves towards a \nglobal society founded on respect for nature, human rights, economic justice and peace. \nThere is growing international consensus that higher education has a responsibility to drive processes \nthat make the world a better place.  Universities are uniquely positioned to catalyze innovations for \nsustainability through our operations, and the traditional missions of education, research and service. \nUniversities are increasingly recognizing the need for graduating students with the attitudes, skills, \nperspectives and knowledge needed to make informed decisions and create solutions to address global \nchallenges.   \nThe University of Alberta embraces the opportunity to shape and strengthen sustainability and will \ncontinue to build upon our past accomplishments and support the university’s goal of integrating \nsustainability into our academic, research and engagement activities. \nThis sustainability plan takes a multi-pronged approach to formalizing how the University of Alberta will \ntake action for sustainability. It provides members of our community with a sense of purpose, direction \nand energy in the form of aspirational and strategic goals that guide our progress to 2020 as resources \ncome available. Although much is being done within all facets of the university, this plan draws attention \nto selected strategies that are currently under way or planned to help transform our institution. Some \nstrategies involve quick wins and incremental changes to existing practices. Other strategies may \nrequire longer-term financial and intellectual investments leading to changes in policies and practices.   \nMaking progress will demand consideration of a diverse range of initiatives and continuous innovation \nwhile maintaining the flexibility to recalibrate in response to other pressures, complexities and risks \nfacing post-secondary education.   It is considered a living document to be reviewed, questioned and \nadjusted periodically and in response to opportunities.  \nOur success will draw upon the collective and collaborative efforts of the over 55,000 faculty, staff, and \nstudents in our campus community, working together to advance our institution’s mission of “uplifting \nthe whole people”.  \nUniversity of Alberta Sustainability Plan 2016-2020  /  Page 7 of 30 \nSustainability at the University of Alberta \nSince 1975, there have been significant achievements towards building a sustainable future at the \nUniversity of Alberta. A university-wide sustainability initiative was launched in 2008, the university’s \ncentenary year. The Office of Sustainability was opened in 2009 to serve as the hub of the initiative, \nwhich seeks to inform, inspire and enable students, faculty and staff to adopt sustainable practices. The \nfocus areas of the initiative are: outreach & engagement, teaching & research, and facilities & \noperations. These areas largely mirror the categories used by the Sustainability Tracking, Assessment \nand Rating System™ (STARS®), which is used to measure and report on our institution’s sustainability \nperformance. \nIn 2011, the university developed its first Sustainability Plan (it was \nreleased in 2012). The plan included broad input from the campus \ncommunity, including the voices of students, staff and faculty. \nContributors included administrative units and committees, as well \nas the award-winning Deliberation on Campus Sustainability \nProject. 2 Since the release of the first Sustainability Plan, the \nuniversity has made progress on sustainability by: \n• Developing a Greenhouse Gas Emissions Reduction Plan \n• Launching the Envision energy management program \n• Certifying new and existing buildings for sustainability \nfeatures and performance \n• Increasing the amount of waste diverted from landfills \n• Launching the Certificate in Sustainability for undergraduate \nstudents \n• Initiating the Green Spaces Certification Program for residences, \nlabs, food vendors, offices and events \n• Creating working groups for waste diversion & sustainable \npurchasing \nThe university has been recognized as one of Canada’s Greenest Employer every year since 2009 and \nwas recognized with an Emerald Award in 2014 for waste outreach programs.  \nSustainability is an important component of the University of Alberta’s Institutional Strategic Plan. The \nSustainability Plan provides more information about our institution’s ambitions and invites the campus \ncommunity to collaborate and coordinate their efforts to build upon the innovations and solutions of \nfaculties, administrative units and students’ associations.  \nSustainability is an approach that requires consideration  of our current and ever-changing social and \nenvironmental needs.

Wherever possible, an \napproximate indication of what percentage of each goal or strategy is complete. \no At Risk – Implementation issues may be limiting or prohibiting the strategy from being \nachieved. Barriers and challenges should be identified for strategies with this progress \nindicator. \no Delayed – Implementation is significantly delayed or placed on hold. Barriers and \nchallenges should be identified for strategies with this progress indicator. \no Achieved – The strategy has been completed. \nMeasuring Sustainability Performance \nThe Sustainability Tracking, Assessment and Rating System™ (STARS®) is the world’s most widely \nrecognized framework for reporting on sustainability in higher education. It is developed by the \nAssociation for the Advancement of Sustainability in Higher Education (AASHE®). It is fully transparent \nand enables meaningful comparison of our performance over time, and benchmarking of our institution \nagainst others through a common set of measurements.  \nUsing STARS® is an appropriate, standard way to track our progress on the sustainability plan and our \njourney towards sustainability. Reporting is comprehensive, covering \nAcademics, Engagement, Operations and Planning & Administration. \nSTARS® is updated frequently, challenging even the highest-\nperforming institutions to strive for continuous improvement.  \nThe Office of Sustainability collaborates with representatives from \nacross the university to prepare an updated STARS® submission \nevery two to three years. Regular reporting keeps stakeholders across \nthe institution engaged with new strategies that fill gaps in our \nperformance.  \nIn October 2014, the University of Alberta received a STARS Gold \nrating. \nEighteen Canadian schools hold a rating in the 1.X versions of STARS®. Of these, the University of \nAlberta achieved the highest score under Education & Research as well as Planning, Administration \nand Engagement. Only four other Canadian institutions have received Gold ratings in these versions. At \nthe time of our last submission, the University of Alberta achieved the second-highest rating in Canada. \nThe university previously received a STARS® Silver rating in 2012.  \nSustainability performance will be assessed in 2016/17 and once again before this plan expires, using \nSTARS® and feedback collected from a range of responsible parties.  \nRead the University of \nAlberta’s 2014 STARS \nsubmission and the \nCampus Sustainability \nInitiatives Report 2012-\n15 for more. \nhttps://stars.aashe.org/institutions/university-of-alberta-ab/report/2014-10-10/\nhttps://stars.aashe.org/institutions/university-of-alberta-ab/report/2014-10-10/\nhttp://issuu.com/officeofsustainability/docs/campus_initiative_report_v3e__singl?e=7210898/30112291\nhttp://issuu.com/officeofsustainability/docs/campus_initiative_report_v3e__singl?e=7210898/30112291\nhttp://issuu.com/officeofsustainability/docs/campus_initiative_report_v3e__singl?e=7210898/30112291\nUniversity of Alberta Sustainability Plan 2016-2020  /  Page 24 of 30 \nNext Steps \nMoving forward, the Office of Sustainability will provide services \nto help change agents achieve our institution’s sustainability \ngoals and strategies.

Participants were asked “What can we do to address our obstacles \nand achieve our vision for 2020?” \n3. Campus-Wide Review (Fall 2015): The draft plan, including accountability measures and \nreporting methodology, was shared for university-wide review and feedback. \n4. Action Planning (Spring 2016 onward): For each strategy, key individuals responsible for the \nuniversity’s sustainability performance are offered the opportunity to use action planning tools to \ndevelop tactical plans.  \nParticipation \nThe University of Alberta community answered the call to play a direct role in the planning process \nthrough a variety of mechanisms. In addition to invitations targeting individuals with key responsibilities, \nopen invitations to participate were shared with 1,534 people during 6 outreach events. \nUniversity of Alberta Sustainability Plan 2016-2020  /  Page 26 of 30 \nOver 600 undergraduate and graduate students, non-academic staff, faculty, professional staff, senior \nadministrators, alumni and community members were actively engaged in the process, including:  \n• ~400 individuals participated in 33 facilitated workshops  \n• ~100 individual or group interviews \n• ~90 people completed the online community conversation kit  \n• ~ 70 group consultations/committees  \n• ~70 departments, faculties, units and organizations  \nDuring the process we promoted transparency by communicating regularly, access to the process and \nfeedback through: \n• sustainability plan website \n• face-to-face meetings \n• 17 background/progress documents \n• 64 workshop reports \n• open house \nThe results of this consultation process were used to help inform development of the University of \nAlberta’s institutional strategic plan and led to the inclusion of sustainability as an institution-wide \nstrategic goal.  \nThe successful implementation of this plan will build upon the relationships established with individuals \nand groups engaged in this planning process. \nObstacles and Challenges \nTo develop the most effective sustainability plan, we must consider our place and our context. The \nfollowing obstacles and opportunities for sustainability were derived during the consultation process, \nand were given consideration while framing the goals and strategies in this plan. \nLack of Resources: Concerned that the availability of resources (including labour, finances and time) \nmay inhibit the progress of sustainability-related programs, initiatives and action.  \nUncertainty: Changes to the political climate, economy and the involvement of external stakeholders \ncreate competing interests for limited resources.  \nCulture: Competition in society is seen as something that drives excellence and can inhibit \ncollaboration and progress towards community well-being and sustainability. Collaboration is required \nto achieve collective impact. Many people have a regimented perspective on educational outcomes, \nwhich hinders the progress on non-traditional learning outcomes such as global citizenship and training \nof students as social change agents. \nUniversity of Alberta Sustainability Plan 2016-2020  /  Page 27 of 30 \nChange Management: The university is large and complex. The approaches required to advance our \nsustainability performance cannot be homogeneous; they will need to be adjusted for each group and \ninitiative.  \nOpportunities & Keys to Success \nParticipants identified the following points as worthy of note for improving the university’s sustainability \nperformance. These keys to success are to be considered by everyone when implementing the goals \nand strategies outlined in this plan: \nLeadership Support: In order to achieve our sustainability goals, support and direction from senior \nleadership is critical. Leaders are essential in establishing sustainability as a priority for our institution \nand ensuring that sustainability is integrated into our business planning.  \nAccountability: Every individual should be responsible for the University of Alberta’s sustainability \nprogress. We all play a role in our resource use, programming and our work as advocates.  There are \npotential collaborators identified for every goal and strategy outlined in this plan.  \nCollaboration: Partnerships and effective collaboration are important to achieve sustainability goals. \nThere should be strong collaboration across faculties and central units for the identification of shared \npriorities, communication, programming and engagement of students in curriculum and research, \nwhenever possible.  \nCommunication: Open and frequent communication among those active in achieving our sustainability \ngoals is required. This includes effective internal strategic communication and outreach to our target \naudiences. Accessible and clear messaging, based on reliable research, should be used for all \nsustainability-related programming. \nMonitoring & Measurement: It is important to treat strategic plans as living documents that are \nrevisited frequently by all responsible parties in order for us to measure our performance and use this \ninformation to guide future efforts. Being transparent and public about this process provides legitimacy \nand enables improved sustainability performance.  \nUniversity of Alberta Sustainability Plan 2016-2020  /  Page 28 of 30 \nAppendix B - Acknowledgements \nExecutive Champions  \nThe executive champions for the sustainability planning process were Don Hickey, Vice President \n(Facilities & Operations) and Dr. Wendy Rodgers, Deputy Provost.

They generate and share \ninspiration, ideas, knowledge, and visions of pathways for change, all of which are needed to create a \nmore sustainable world. The University of Alberta is in a particularly strong place to address the \nchallenges of sustainability, or a stronger shift in societies across the world for long-term change that \nsupports the health, vitality and resilience in the social-ecological system. The expertise, leadership, \ncollective good will, program and course offerings, and research at the University of Alberta point to an \nenormous opportunity to inform multi-faceted ways of thinking and doing that shape sustainability.  \nThere is no discipline, no professor, no student who is not touched by the constraints and opportunities \nthat exist in a world with more clearly recognized limits in resources, needs for human capital and \ncreativity, and ways to cooperate and organize to meet collective goals. This report summarizes an \narray of ideas to deepen and broaden sustainability education and scholarship at the University of \nAlberta that were brought forward by University of Alberta professors, administrative leaders, students, \nstudent leaders and alumni. There is energy and commitment to pursue these ideas, and the time is \nripe to strengthen our role as a higher educational institution that helps build a better future for all.  \n“Whatever we do now is going to influence the future, and probably more the future of our students than \nour own futures. We are going to make an impact that we may never actually see and that we may never \nhear about. That’s why doing this matters. That’s what teaching is: you stand in front of a classroom or in \nfront of a computer, and you are influencing people who may never come back and tell you that you’ve \nmade a difference. You trust that it sometimes happens, because we know that it does. It’s appropriate \nthat we do this at the University.” \n- Christie Schultz, Assistant Dean, Academic, Faculty of Extension \nA Plan for Deepening Sustainability Education and Scholarship   /  Page 4 of 34 \nBackground \nThis is an academic companion document to the University of Alberta’s Sustainability Plan (2016-\n2020). It provides information about the goals and strategies that were suggested to guide sustainability \nin education and research at the University of Alberta and that will connect to the overall campus \nsustainability initiative. \nThe University of Alberta’s Board of Governor’s endorsed the University’s sustainability commitment \nand guiding principles in 2008. Subsequently, sustainability was featured as a companion element to \nthe last academic plan and a key component of the last sustainability plan. In 2015, the University of \nAlberta began the thinking that will lay the foundation for the next 5 to 10 years under our new president \nDavid Turpin.  This report compliments the University of Alberta’s Comprehensive Institutional Plan \n(2016) which calls for a sustainability commitment in planning documents and building projects.   It is \nhoped and anticipated that this report will help inform the University of Alberta’s commitment to \nsustainability education and scholarship.    \nThe goals and strategies in this document originated from several consultations and workshops held \nbetween October 2014 and February 2016: \n• Workshop on October 17, 2014 on “Sustainability, Environment and Social Justice in the Social \nSciences and Humanities at the University of Alberta” with 22 professors in the social sciences, \narts and humanities. This workshop was part of the Provost’s Initiatives and it was supported by \nthe Kule Institute of Advanced Studies and the Office of Sustainability. \n• Sustainability Plan workshops on education and research with two groups: 1) the Office of \nSustainability Academic Advisory Committee (OSAAC)1, and 2) a group composed of \nundergraduate and graduate students, non-academic staff, faculty, professional staff, alumni \nand community members. Each group attended a Vision workshop that sought to understand \nour shared vision for sustainability in education and research at the University of Alberta in \n2020. Participants subsequently attended an Obstacles and Strategies workshop to look for \nways to overcome obstacles and develop strategies to help the University of Alberta realize our \nshared vision in the next five years. \n• Several individual consultations with faculty Deans, Associate Deans, representatives, program \nchairs, centre directors, and graduate and undergraduate student groups to obtain additional \nsuggestions on how to deepen and broaden sustainability education and scholarship at the \nUniversity of Alberta.2 \n• Luncheon Discussion on February 29, 2016 on Academic Initiatives in Sustainability at the \nUniversity of Alberta \n1 In spring 2015, the Office of Sustainability Academic Advisory Committee (OSAAC) was renamed the Provost's Academic \nAdvisory Council on Sustainability (PAACS). \n2 Appendix A provides additional details about these workshops and consultations. Appendix B lists the participants who \nwere involved in the consultation process. \nA Plan for Deepening Sustainability Education and Scholarship   /  Page 5 of 34 \nOne of the key challenges that came out of these consultations is the need to change the perception \nheld by some of the faculty, students and staff that sustainability is only about improving the \nenvironment. A broad definition of sustainability is applied to the goals and strategies in this plan: \n“Sustainability is the process of living within the limits of available physical, natural and social resources in \nways that allow the living systems in which humans are embedded to thrive in perpetuity.” \n- Academic Advisory Committee Working Definition, Office of Sustainability, 2010 \nThis definition addresses the ability for individual, social, ecological, economic, health and cultural \nsystems to thrive and exist within the limits of the ecosystem sustenance base upon which all life \ndepends. Professors and students in professional programs with stringent accreditation requirements, \nsuch as Law, Rehabilitative Medicine, Pharmacy, and Medicine and Dentistry, appear to recognize \nthemselves less in the concept of teaching and researching in sustainability, yet they play a critical role \nin the health, design, and social justice systems of society. Students in particular may not readily \nrecognize that sustainability is the healthy functioning of society and an economic system that supports \nthe well-being of all. \nThe following two sections outline a vision for education and research at the University of Alberta that \ncame out of the Sustainability Plan consultations, along with suggested goals and strategies to help \nattain that vision. The Goals and Strategies section uses the same numbering system as the Education \n& Research section in the University of Alberta’s draft Sustainability Plan (2016-2020). The main \nheadings are the key goals (Goals 2.1 to 2.3), and the strategies associated with each of these goals \nare included in bold text beneath them. Additional background information from workshops and \nindividual consultations is provided below each strategy. This information provides context useful for \nguiding the implementation of the strategies and for strengthening connections across the University. \nAfter Goals and Strategies, Next Steps discusses the process for sharing content in “A Plan for \nDeepening Sustainability Education and Scholarship at the University of Alberta 2016-2020”. This is \nfollowed by a final note about the future of sustainability in education and research at the University of \nAlberta. \nA Plan for Deepening Sustainability Education and Scholarship   /  Page 6 of 34 \nVisions for Education & Research3 \nWe envision students having opportunities to learn, research and apply sustainability using \ninterdisciplinary approaches. Through outreach and partnerships, the university brings research and \nnew knowledge to the community, enabling individuals, communities, organizations and industries to \nachieve sustainability. The university is recognized as a leader for taking significant action on climate \nchange and for capitalizing on the knowledge and strengths of our academic and research \ncommunities. \n3 The draft Sustainability Plan (2016-2020) describes the process used to create this vision statement.  \nA Plan for Deepening Sustainability Education and Scholarship   /  Page 7 of 34 \nGoals and Strategies \nThe goals and strategies provided below are identified with numbers that match with goals and \nstrategies identified in the University of Alberta’s 2016-2020 Sustainability Plan, Section 2, Education & \nResearch.  \nGoal 2.1 Encourage the campus community and the public to learn about sustainability \na. Strategy: Create awareness of resources, research findings, demonstration projects and \nexpertise. \nOne approach is to prompt broader learning about sustainability through the offering of the University of \nAlberta’s varied embedded undergraduate certificates. There are several embedded certificates at the \nUniversity of Alberta that are either current or in development. The new Certificate in Sustainability is \navailable to undergraduate students in nine faculties, including the Augustana campus. Augustana also \noffers a Certificate in Sustainability as part of five one-day courses through their Extended Education \nprogram. Other options with connections to sustainability at the University of Alberta include the \nundergraduate Certificate in International Learning, the Certificate in Community Engagement and \nService-Learning, and the Certificate in Global Citizenship. The Faculty of Science is developing a \nCertificate in Leadership with the Faculty of Arts, as well as a Certificate in Interdisciplinary Science \nStudies and a Research Certificate in Science. There has also been discussion on moving forward with \nAdapted Fitness Provider Certification (embedded and free-standing) in the Faculty of Physical \nEducation and Recreation that would serve to support students, new graduates and exercise \nprofessionals in the community to learn ways to adapt physical activity and exercise for individuals \nexperiencing disability. There is potential and public interest in a professional certificate, offered by the \nFaculty of Extension, in Sustainability or a more focused area (e.g. Climate Change Policy and \nPractice) for post-graduates. \nGraduate students (incoming and outgoing elected members of the Graduate Student Association) \nsuggested developing a Sustainability Certificate for graduate students that is practicum- and research-\nbased, rather than course-based. They suggested creating more professional development \nopportunities tied to sustainability and offering online, for-credit professional development courses. An \nexample of such a course could be a credit course on green building certification (the Faculty of \nExtension currently offers this as a non-credit course). They would also like to see sustainability-related \nevents and learning opportunities across the disciplines. This could include team-based graduate \nstudent research opportunities to work on wicked problems (i.e., hard-to-solve problems that are \ninterconnected with other problems). \nMassive open online courses (MOOCs) could make sustainability curriculum more accessible to \nstudents limited by mobility, work schedules, and living in remote areas. Examples of forthcoming \nMOOCs at the University of Alberta include: Indigenous Studies 101 (Faculty of Native Studies), \nIntroduction to the Arctic: Climate (Faculty of Science), Mountains 101 (an interdisciplinary course in \nthe Faculty of Physical Education and Recreation), and other Arctic courses that will focus on People \nand Cultures, Economics and Natural Resources (Faculty of Science). Potential future MOOCs, such \nas “Transitions to Sustainability” and “Climate Change Policy, Practice and Programs”, could offer more \nA Plan for Deepening Sustainability Education and Scholarship   /  Page 8 of 34 \ndirect sustainability learning. The Faculty of Nursing would like to offer a future MOOC on nutrition and \nexercise, which are also key subjects for sustainable social systems. \nGreater access to sustainability education through the University of Alberta could also include more \nonline courses, as well as course-based Master’s degrees (both online and on campus) in related areas \nof sustainability, to broaden and deepen sustainability learning. The Faculty of Nursing is particularly \ninterested in online sustainability courses that could be offered to their nursing students as electives. \nThere are several Master’s programs that are currently being developed at the University of Alberta. \nFor example, the Faculty of Science is developing a professional Master’s degree in Environmental \nMonitoring or Environmental Innovation. The Faculty of Science is also waiting for approval of a course-\nbased Master’s in Planning. The Faculty of Agricultural, Life and Environmental Sciences is developing \nan interdisciplinary, course-based, distance learning (online) Master’s program in Forestry, and \nEcological Restoration and Reclamation. The Faculty of Native Studies is working on an online, course-\nbased Master’s in Native Studies.  \nb. Strategy: Promote sustainability-related programs. \nThe University of Alberta could train those who regularly interact with current and prospective students \nabout the curricular and co-curricular opportunities to learn about sustainability at the University of \nAlberta. For example, campus recruiters, internship coordinators and career advisors could more \nstrongly promote our sustainability-related academic, co-curricular and engagement programs. \nThose who we consulted with often held that making out-of-the-classroom opportunities for learning \nabout sustainability should be accessible and affordable to all students. Promotion of these \nopportunities may include reaching out through the Students’ Union and targeting student clubs and \norganizations on campus where uptake is likely to be strong. Graduate students asked for better \ncommunication among departments, graduate coordinators who advise students on courses, and the \nGraduate Student Association on new course offerings in sustainability. \nc. Strategy: Encourage diverse educational approaches to teach about sustainability across the \ndisciplines.  \nMany people recommended that the leaders of the University of Alberta encourage the development of \nnew courses in sustainability and the integration of sustainability concepts and applications into existing \ncourses. The development of sustainability content and courses could be encouraged by offering \ncourse releases to build new courses or to substantially revise existing courses. Funding could be \nprovided for pilot projects, course field trips, or special learning and training opportunities for faculty. \nFor example, faculty could receive funds to attend the annual conference of the Association for the \nAdvancement of Sustainability in Higher Education, which provides rich learning opportunities on \nsustainability course content and delivery. An example of an interdisciplinary course being developed \nby the Faculties of Arts and Science is a global issues course to address the connections between \nscience and society.  \nSome professors argued for more flexibility in pedagogical structure. Blended learning would reduce \nutility use, because roughly half of the learning is done outside the classroom. Flipped classrooms are \nclasses that physically meet less frequently to focus on exercises, projects or discussions. Massive \nopen online courses (MOOCs) are courses that people can take remotely, thus eliminating travel to and \nA Plan for Deepening Sustainability Education and Scholarship   /  Page 9 of 34 \nfrom class. Finally, alterations to class duration and frequency can better enable students to take \ncourses outside of their disciplines and enable instructors to involve outside experts. \nStrong interest exists in topics such as sustainable businesses, technological advances in energy \nsavings and renewable energy, and science citizenship, yet the courses that are available are generally \nlimited to students who are in those majors (e.g. Engineering, Business and Science). There is an \nopportunity to deepen and broaden sustainability learning by developing courses for non-majors. \nGraduate students in particular asked for more opportunities to take sustainability-focused courses.  \nProject challenges and competitions that are hosted by faculties or broader units and posed to student-\nled groups could create a greater sense of efficacy and hope among students interested in \nsustainability. For example, the Heroes for Health challenge previously held by the by the University of \nAlberta’s Health and Wellness team could be repeated in a Heroes for Sustainability competition. \nMany participants in our consultations suggested having a long-range goal that all programs provide \nexperiential learning opportunities involving systems and long-term thinking. For example, there is \nbroad academic support for a new initiative called Learning Experiences in Applied Projects (LEAP), led \nby the Office of Sustainability. LEAP creates opportunities for problem-based teaching, research and \nhands-on experiences. These “living lab” projects use the natural, social and built environment of the \ncampus as a testing ground to develop solutions to address sustainability goals on campus and \nbeyond. \nSeveral professors and leaders recommended that we teach sustainability through university \nprogramming in outdoor education, health, play, cultural events, storytelling, and the arts. When \nstudents come to know the University’s campuses not only as places for classroom learning, but also \nas places with natural features that are aesthetically pleasing (e.g. Edmonton’s River Valley), places for \noutside unstructured learning, and places for creative expression, there is greater opportunity to tap into \nlocal capacity to see the value in nature and in place-based knowledge and talent. It was recommended \nthat we should continue to invest in the natural beauty and ecosystem functioning of our university \ngrounds and use this management knowledge as a teaching tool for students.  \nMany faculty members suggested that promoting our Education Abroad program, which offers \nexchange, internship and summer programs, can further enhance experiential learning tied to \nsustainability. Other international spring, reading week or semester-long courses at the University can \nbroaden students’ international learning of sustainability, particularly around cultural sustainability.  \nThe widespread adoption of a healthy lifestyle is an important component of social sustainability. The \nFaculty of Physical Education and Recreation (PER) has extensive programming for university and \ncommunity members that promotes health and wellness. This includes activities and courses with an \noutdoor component (such as INT D 284: Mountain Backcountry Field Skills). The Faculty of PER also \nprovides opportunities for numerous activities in the facilities that they manage. This faculty is also \nbuilding a new major in Adaptive Physical Activity within their Bachelor of Kinesiology that addresses \nproviding greater opportunity and access to physical activity and sport to those with disabilities. The \nPhysical Education and Recreation faculty could also highlight better their teaching contributions in the \narea of sustainability around behavioural medicine, recreation and health education, which promotes \nhealthy behaviours among diverse populations.  \nA Plan for Deepening Sustainability Education and Scholarship   /  Page 10 of 34 \nGoal 2.2 Encourage exposure to interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary teaching and \nresearch connected to sustainability.  \nInterdisciplinary and transdisciplinary teaching and research require building bridges within and outside \nof the university. Several people who were consulted asserted that greater dialogue about the role of \nhigher education in advancing teaching, research, demonstration projects, interventions, and outreach \non sustainability is needed to build shared understanding among faculty and students about the \nmeaning and importance of sustainability. Departments, faculties, and academic program chairs are \nencouraged to engage in University and community dialogues about where academic needs are likely \nto change, in terms of important topics, methodologies, technologies, and changing socio-political \ncontexts that will shift local, national and global conditions for sustainability. We could place further \nemphasis on professors’ engagement with the broader community of government, industry, faith-based \norganizations, non-governmental organizations, indigenous organizations, and other civic and \ncommunity organizations on the perceived needs for sustainability research. The consultations for this \nplan indicated an abiding interest in sustainable food systems, climate change mitigation and \nadaptation, energy conservation, cultural sustainability, and sustainable consumption.  \nTo meet Goal 2.2, the number of instructors, students and researchers involved with or exposed to \ninterdisciplinary or transdisciplinary teaching and research connected to sustainability would also likely \nincrease. Some universities have chosen to require a 100-level course in sustainability for all students. \nWhile this would be challenging in some programs that have less room for non-required courses in their \naccreditation standards, a required sustainability course could create common ground across \ndisciplines and showcase a distinct commitment to sustainability education at the University of Alberta. \nSuch a course could be delivered online or through a MOOC.  \nAugustana has a core requirement for environmental sustainability. The Faculty of Science is \ndeveloping a first-year course on critical thinking and weighing evidence for all incoming science \nstudents. This will foster common knowledge among science students and help them understand \npotential applications of science.  \nThere was a common recommendation for more place- and project-based teaching, which may be \nmore easily taught across the University of Alberta’s campuses, field stations, research facilities, and \ndemonstration projects. We have an opportunity to use our university as a sandbox, providing \nopportunities for creative and collaborative exploration. Greater linkages between the Prairie Urban \nFarm at South Campus and the Devonian Botanic Garden, for example, could complement a growing \ninterest and concern in sustainable food systems. This could also include strengthening their \nconnections to the University’s operational activities (e.g. Dining Services). More use could be made of \nAugustana’s Miquelon Lake Research Station, which aspires to demonstrate sustainable operations \nand carry out teaching and research in sustainability. Greater flexibility for students to take \nsustainability courses outside of their degrees or to pursue a minor in sustainability in their respective \nprograms would broaden exposure to sustainability topics across the majors. Graduate students would \nlike the concepts of sustainability to be more widely incorporated into their courses, research training, \nand professional development opportunities. \na. Strategy: Build the capacity to include aspects of diversity and inclusivity within research, \nand honour diverse research methods.  \nA Plan for Deepening Sustainability Education and Scholarship   /  Page 11 of 34 \nThose consulted for this report often called for greater integration of Aboriginal content into courses \nacross the University of Alberta to improve general knowledge about the recommendations of the Truth \nand Reconciliation Commission of Canada4, the current threats to sustainability across Canada, and \nthe ways in which indigenous peoples of Canada have maintained or sought sustainability in their \ncommunities. University of Alberta North, a new initiative to coordinate northern research initiatives, can \nfacilitate this capacity, especially in terms of building northern research capacity. Augustana has shown \ncommitment in this area with the recent hire of a new professor who links sustainability to History and \nNative Studies. Others in the Faculty of Native Studies recommended exposing students, faculty and \nstaff to the relationship between sustainability and traditional knowledge in native communities in \nCanada and elsewhere. In particular, the Faculty of Native Studies suggested offering more courses \nrelated to collaborative research skills to build land-based knowledge, and indigenous rights and \nbenefits with respect to resource development. \nThe Faculty of Physical Education and Research suggested that they are in a good position to teach \nhow to design spaces and be sensitive to diversity and inclusivity in various work and play settings. The \nFaculty of Physical Education and Recreation is also considering purchasing a property that would \nallow on-the-land training related to mountain studies, outdoor recreation, physical adaptations, sports \ntraining and performance, and other learning modules related to natural areas. Greater connections \nbetween the Faculty of Physical Education and Recreation and Human Resource Services or the \nEmployment Equity Advisory Committee (EEAC) could foster greater in-house collaborations on \nsustainability. \nFinally, University leaders can influence the funding of sustainability research by advocating for \nappropriate reviewers for research grants, as there is a sense that most internal grant applications are \nreviewed by those in strict disciplines who may not appreciate the interdisciplinary nature of \nsustainability research. \nb. Strategy: Celebrate professors with a stated commitment to and/or expertise in sustainability.  \nMany of our participants recommended that the University of Alberta showcase faculty, alumni and \nresearch teams that demonstrate excellence in advancing sustainability knowledge, practices, policies \nor projects. For example, the Office of Sustainability periodically showcases a professor who carries out \nsustainability research and/or teaching under the banner “Faces of Sustainability.” The University home \npage could also showcase professors, graduate students and professional staff members who make \noutstanding contributions to sustainability scholarship, education, programming or operations. \nIt is striking how many professors in the social sciences, arts and humanities are shifting their research \nfocus to sustainable food systems, investigating areas like food justice, food sovereignty, food security \nand sustainable agriculture. Other strong areas of interest include: rural community development \n(especially at Augustana), sustainable energy systems, cold climate and resource-based economy \n4 The Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada (TRC) was constituted and created by the Indian Residential Schools \nSettlement Agreement. The Commission travelled throughout Canada over a period of six years to hear from Aboriginal \npeople who had been taken from their families as children and placed in residential schools. In 2015, the Commission \nsubmitted its final report, which can be downloaded from http://nctr.ca/reports.php.  \nhttp://nctr.ca/reports.php\nA Plan for Deepening Sustainability Education and Scholarship   /  Page 12 of 34 \nsustainable design (especially in circumpolar regions), health and wellness, and governance and \nplanning of cities and landscapes (including cumulative impact assessment and biodiversity protection).  \nMany of those we consulted also recommended that the University of Alberta increase the numbers of \nprofessors with expertise in sustainability and strategically hire new professors with a demonstrated \ninterest in areas like climate change and corporate social sustainability. Faculties and departments \ncould also create awards and scholarships for sustainability and promote creative engagement \nbetween faculty and students on sustainability topics suitable for that faculty, as the Alberta School of \nBusiness has done with its student group, Net Impact.  \nc. Strategy: Create opportunities to connect colleagues with a stated commitment to and/or \nexpertise in sustainability.  \nOne common suggestion to foster greater opportunities for colleagues with a stated commitment to \nsustainability is to create a sustainability centre or related public policy institute focused on curriculum \nand research initiatives. Such a centre could provide programming for public policy, for specific \nprofessional programs, or for a summer immersive experience in sustainability. This centre or institute \ncould carry out a number of integrative programs to build capacity in sustainability education and \nscholarship at the University of Alberta. Representatives from the Faculty of Arts and the Faculty of \nLaw, in particular, asserted the need for a place in which academics across faculties who are interested \nin sustainability could more easily collaborate with one other and coordinate sustainability-related \nprojects. Efforts to promote such a centre should build on the lessons to be learned from the Alberta \nCentre for Sustainable Rural Communities at Augustana, and liase with this Institute as appropriate.  \nThe institute could host University of Alberta professors who are seconded to be part of the institute for \none to three years to lead academic sustainability initiatives. It could also host think tanks or \nsustainability scholars from other universities. This institute could hold events such as “interdisciplinary \nspeed dating” or “design and policy charrettes” on sustainability topics with students across the \ndisciplines. There could also be panel discussions that link sustainability researchers (professors, \nundergraduate students and graduate students) and encourage them to share their research on \ncommon topics of interest and to develop research clusters in areas such as climate change. This \ninstitute would bring people together and build bridges across the disciplines to encourage scholarship \nthat informs global integrative efforts, such as the United Nations-endorsed Sustainable Development \nGoals. It could host reading groups and provide special courses that are not offered by the departments \non innovative methodologies in sustainability sciences and scholarship.  \nSuch an institute could also offer focused faculty and graduate student workshops and hold an annual \nconference on research and teaching in sustainability, potentially in collaboration with the Association \nfor the Advancement of Sustainability in Higher Education and other institutions with successful \nacademic sustainability initiatives. It could host a sustainability leadership summit for faculty and \nresearch associates, building off the Student Sustainability Summit (hosted each year by Sustain SU \nand the Office of Sustainability), as well as the Alberta Student Leadership Summit (hosted by the \nStudent Group Services, the University of Alberta, and the Students’ Union). At these three events, \nA Plan for Deepening Sustainability Education and Scholarship   /  Page 13 of 34 \nprofessors could learn how to incorporate more of the sustainability learning opportunities being offered \nby the Office of Sustainability and the Global Education Program5 into their course syllabi.  \nGraduate students in particular suggested an institute that could act as a “sustainability hub”, a space \nfor graduate students to meet and work together on sustainability initiatives. The institute could be a \nclearinghouse of information for professors and graduate students about interdisciplinary journal \npublishing opportunities and networking possibilities across campus and across Canada on prescient \nsustainability research topics (e.g. integrated watershed management). \nProfessors frequently held that their research could have more impact if there was greater interaction \nbetween researchers and the media and government. The University could better facilitate this \ninteraction by providing training in knowledge translation. The Faculty of Extension is offering a new \n“Strategic Reframing Course” that focuses on communication methods to create change in common \nunderstanding, tools to help build general understanding of complex issues, and approaches to \ntransform views on cultural and societal issues. This course would be a strong benefit to many \nuniversity faculty members to increase the impact of their research. Of particular interest are the \nprocesses around how university expertise can be more effectively applied to government decision-\nmaking and planning. Such training might be offered through the Centre for Teaching and Learning, the \nFaculty of Graduate and Research Studies, or the Research Services Office. \nd. Strategy: Promote opportunities for students and faculty to participate in sustainability \ninitiatives.  \nA centralized online information and networking system, in particular, was commonly suggested in our \nconsultations as a way to promote opportunities for students and faculty to participate in sustainability \ninitiatives. A centralized online system would help researchers with common interests connect with one \nother. Many faculty and graduate students spoke of the need for an easier, faster way to find others \nacross campus and across disciplines who are studying similar topics (e.g. water scarcity or disaster \npreparedness). The University should continue to support  the Undergraduate Research Initiative, \nwhich has a portal system that effectively advertises research opportunities for undergraduates, and \nmore recently offers research internships that focus on sustainability (funded by the Office of \nSustainability). \nAn online system containing up-to-date information on sustainability-focused and -related courses \nwould also help faculty and academic advisors suggest options to students for electives, especially \n“free electives,” that complement the student’s general interest in sustainability. The online system \n5 For the Office of Sustainability, these learning opportunities are led by the Campus Sustainability Initiative which \nprovides institutional leadership and campus-wide communications and programs to integrate sustainability values \ninto all aspects of the University of Alberta. The Office of Sustainability engages and encourages students, staff and \nfaculty to engage in sustainability practices. A number of speakers, workshops, grants and volunteer opportunities \nexist for students to learn more about sustainability and lead sustainability efforts.  \nThe Global Education program inspires and cultivates students as the next generation of leaders prepared to tackle \ncritical issues facing the globe. Their signature event, International Week, is the University’s largest annual extra-\ncurricular educational event and is the most extensive event of its kind on a Canadian campus, and offers workshops, \nexhibits and cultural performances. Other learning opportunities are fostered by International House, grants for \ninternational education, and themed programs that bridge students with internal and external partners. \nhttp://www.globaled.ualberta.ca/en/InternationalWeek.aspx\nA Plan for Deepening Sustainability Education and Scholarship   /  Page 14 of 34 \nwould help instructors articulate and advertise what students can learn from sustainability courses that \nthey do not tend to learn from other courses. The University of Alberta’s standard online course catalog \ncould also provide an indicator for courses that are sustainability focused.  \ne. Strategy: Encourage departments and faculties to develop long-range sustainability plans \nencompassing operational practices, teaching, research, and degree programs.  \nFaculties and departments are encouraged, through an inclusive process, to identify programs they \nwish to add, enrich or discontinue, as part of their own long-range relevance to society. Part of this \nwould be to conduct long-range planning on new hires in emerging sustainability areas or in areas for \nwhich the University of Alberta lacks expertise. A delegated faculty leader, or sustainability committee, \ncould be assigned responsibility to inform the process; by summarizing what has been done elsewhere \nand suggesting updates to programs and curriculum in regards to sustainability. This faculty leader or \ncommittee could report on the department’s or unit’s progress, such as facilitating the opportunity for \nstudents to take sustainability courses outside their faculties, fostering cooperation for co-teaching or \ncourse cross-listing, using the University for place-based learning, and facilitating collaborative program \ndevelopment with other faculties. The faculty leader or committee could also assist in finding instructors \nand resources to offer new courses that are currently needed but not yet offered. \nFor example, the Faculty of Agricultural, Life and Environmental Sciences expressed interest in \ndeveloping a new interdisciplinary degree in sustainable systems. Building programs such as this \nrequires cross-departmental conceptualization of the program, its purpose, its learning outcomes, and \nits capacity to provide excellent sustainability education across multiple disciplines, all of which require \nleadership and a plan. Faculty of Arts representatives held that such long-range plans would help \nprompt the review and reinvigoration of programs such as the Bachelor of Arts in Environmental \nStudies, which is offered by the Faculty of Arts and the Faculty of Agricultural, Life and Environmental \nSciences. \nThe long-range plans could also prompt departments and program leaders to evaluate existing \nprograms and courses to identify gaps in sustainability content, remove outdated material, avoid \nunnecessary repetition, and share learning materials (such as curricular repositories). Faculty often \nrecommended the need to find easier ways to develop courses in specific areas, such as sustainable \nfood systems, climate change mitigation and adaption, cultural sustainability and so on. A repository for \nexisting syllabi in emerging areas of interest would therefore be useful. Faculty members also \ndiscussed the rigidity of too many programs that require most or even all of students’ courses to be \ntaken in the same faculty. This directly discourages interdisciplinary learning. Program reform could \nallow and encourage more electives in sustainability courses and cross-listed courses between \nfaculties. The long-range plans could routinize succession planning for hiring and retention. Professors \nand senior leaders we consulted called for a democratic process that fosters prioritization, smooth \nteaching transitions, and long-term investment in senior academic leaders and academic staff, \ninstructors and contract employees. \nOne key element of such long-range plans would be for departments to define the topics and \ninterventions in their scholarship that relate to and promote sustainability. Some faculties, such as the \nFaculty of Rehabilitative Medicine, did not recognize their role in sustainability until a directed \ndiscussion on sustainability and their programs highlighted linkages between health and wellness, \nhealth care resources, disability studies, and social justice in the broader meaning of sustainability. It \nA Plan for Deepening Sustainability Education and Scholarship   /  Page 15 of 34 \nwas advised that professors and program leaders set aside time to explore what sustainability means \nfor them and their programs. An inclusive, engaging planning process would foster greater long-term \ninvestments in program improvements.  \nSome particular suggestions came from Native Studies faculty, who identified the need for better \ninterdisciplinary course offerings on indigenous orientations to environmental protection and business, \nsuch as co-taught courses on cooperative approaches to resource development and Aboriginal \nbusiness development. Native Studies faculty identified gaps in the curriculum for Environmental \nConservation Science and Native Studies students. There is no course offering in these programs on \nthe philosophy and epistemology of science. This further reproduces students’ lack of awareness about \nhow traditional knowledge and science can be used together to address sustainability challenges (e.g. \nhabitat protection or water sanitation) in indigenous communities and in other non-Western cultures.  \nMany people in our consultation process encouraged stronger priority given to sustainability through its \nrecognition by faculty evaluation committees. For example, annual reports for faculties could ask \nprofessors and faculty service officers (FSOs) to indicate which of their research projects and papers \naddress sustainability on or off campus and indicate which are interdisciplinary. This would have \nseveral benefits. First, it would signal to faculty and FSOs that this kind of research is encouraged and \nrecognized as important. Second, it would allow the University of Alberta to encourage using our \ncampus as a “small city” for sustainability learning and to report on this kind of research more readily in \nthe Sustainability Tracking, Assessment & Rating System™ (STARS). STARS is the tool used by the \nUniversity of Alberta to benchmark our institution’s sustainability performance. \nMany faculty members who were consulted saw FEC evaluation processes as disincentives to \ncommunity-engaged sustainability research and faculty communities of practice in sustainability \nteaching and research. Community-based research requires time to develop mutual understanding and \ntrusting partnerships both within and outside the university. Therefore, FECs could more fully recognize \nthe value of building partnerships within and outside the university, as well as the time investments \nrequired for faculty to do this well. \nAssistant professors could be encouraged to engage in sustainability teaching and research, and they \ncould be rewarded by FECs when they do so. In some faculties, professors reported undue pressure to \nobtain grants that fund narrow questions, at the expense of pursuing partnerships and funding to \naddress sustainability issues that are inherently interdisciplinary or transdisciplinary.  \nMany faculty also recommended that FECs show greater recognition and value of “slow scholarship” or \nthe provision of sufficient time for higher order thinking and writing that is important to address wicked \nproblems, often resulting in books that take one to three years to write. Additionally, giving equal credit \nfor publishing in interdisciplinary journals as in disciplinary journals would signal to professors that there \nis support for sustainability scholarship. Professors who co-write sustainability articles in collaboration \nwith staff in professional journals could also be rewarded for making important contributions to \nsustainability scholarship and practice.  \nGraduate students and the Kule Institute of Advanced Studies recommended the development of \nguidelines for “sustainable research”, which would address practical and ideal guidelines to spur \npositive change for people and the planet. To promote sustainable research, researchers could share \nand conserve research materials and equipment, share research funding with other university partners \nand community partners (currently deemed to be very bureaucratically onerous or impossible), reduce \nA Plan for Deepening Sustainability Education and Scholarship   /  Page 16 of 34 \ncarbon footprints due to travel, and assure consistent three- to four-year funding of research assistants \nwho have developed knowledge and skills in a particular area. Professors could be rewarded for \naddressing policy, practice and public knowledge sustainability challenges, as this strengthens the \nuniversity’s long-term relationships with local people and places. There are also enormous needs to \npreserve and maintain access to data, which some respondents referred to as “data sustainability.” \nGoal 2.3 Support faculty members to integrate sustainability into their teaching. \na. Strategy: Develop initiatives to integrate sustainability into curriculum and academic \nprogramming.  \nA common suggestion was to prepare faculty to integrate sustainability into their teaching via faculty \ndevelopment workshops, new faculty orientation and by developing a community of practice. Faculty \nexpressed the desire for more opportunities to interact with each other on the topic of teaching. By \ndiscussing course content among themselves, faculty can learn from each other about how to foster \ngreater critical thinking about sustainability within their degree programs, as well as how to use \nemerging language (e.g. resilience, anthropocene, transitions and life-cycle analysis) that allows \ngreater common understanding of sustainability subjects. Nursing and Science faculty in particular \nemphasize the role of critical thinking as part of teaching sustainability. Nursing faculty also emphasize \nleadership training, which they assert could be oriented more directly to sustainability issues. \nNew faculty are in a good position to invest in their teaching, which can yield long-term benefits for \nthemselves, their students, and the University’s ability to offer up-to-date academic programs and \ncourses. Efforts to engage new professors in sustainability-related workshops and other sharing and \ntraining opportunities could be expanded. \nMany of our contacts for this report held that interdisciplinary teaching is a challenge, because most \nprofessors were trained within a specific discipline and their programs are built on past disciplinary \nfundamental content. Greater opportunity for faculty members to co-teach on a sustainability topic can \nenhance their knowledge and interdisciplinary offerings. Interdisciplinary teaching, and moreover \nprogram development, take vision and time to develop, so creating space for faculty to do so through \nspecial assignments, teaching relief or other incentives may better facilitate these developments. Many \nfaculty members held that departments and faculties can be too inward looking and territorial, which \ninhibits interdisciplinary teaching and scholarship.  \nFurther, many faculty members would also like to see a reduction in administrative tasks, especially \nwhere the delegation of these tasks could be more appropriately assigned. This would provide more \ntime for thoughtful and creative teaching and research and to develop new sustainability initiatives. \nGreater exchange between Augustana Campus, Campus Saint-Jean, and the University of Alberta \nnorth campus for sustainability speakers, workshops, Sustainability Awareness Week events, and so \non, could foster greater interdisciplinary faculty and student exchange. \nThe Faculty of Business participants called for more faculty members to teach students about a \ngrowing business emphasis on sustainability. The Alberta School of Business has a suite of courses on \ncorporate sustainability, social responsibility, and communications. It also has the Canadian Centre for \nCorporate Social Responsibility, which supports creativity and innovation in business practices that \nsupport the quality of life experienced by the communities in which they operate.  \nA Plan for Deepening Sustainability Education and Scholarship   /  Page 17 of 34 \nAnother example of an initiative that integrates sustainability into research is the “After Oil” project, \nwhich is a large, international academic and public research project based at the University of Alberta \nthat operates under the rubric of the Petrocultures Research Group (PRG). More recently, the Parkland \nInstitute at the University of Alberta was awarded a large Social Science and Humanities Research \nCouncil grant that partners with other organizations across three provinces on “Mapping the Power of \nthe Carbon-Extractive Corporate Resource Sector.”  \nOther initiatives could provide greater support at the University of Alberta in regards to providing start-\nup funds or small grants for larger grant applications from the Research Services Office, the Faculty of \nGraduate Studies and Research, and the Faculties would be useful. Given that more sustainability \nresearch is in the “impact sciences” (which address the social, economic and ecological consequences \nof human activities) than the “production sciences” (which address the ways to create and expand the \nuse of natural resources, efficient processes for making things, and useful consumer products), \nobtaining research funding for sustainability projects is more challenging. Thus, in-house funding to \nbuild up sustainability research capacity would be particularly useful. The application requirements for \nsmall amounts of money should not be so onerous that they discourage participation. \nAt a sustainability workshop for the social sciences and humanities in October 2014, professors \nidentified numerous sources of potential funding6 for sustainability-related research. Many of these \nrequire matching funding that could be provided by the University of Alberta. The Office of \nAdvancement at the University of Alberta could target donors, especially in the resource sector, to \ndonate to an “endorsement fund” that would provide start-up funds for sustainability research related to \nthat sector.  \nThe Kule Institute of Advanced Studies at the University of Alberta funds transformational \ninterdisciplinary and comparative research at the highest standards nationally and internationally, and \nhas recently funded a number of sustainability focused and related grant proposals. \nThe University of Alberta and City of Edmonton Sustainability Scholars program offers applied research \nand professional development experience to graduate students through an innovative summer \ninternship program that sponsors graduate students to work on sustainability-related applied research \nprojects. This program, which partners the Office of the Provost, Office of Sustainability, Faculty of \nGraduate Studies and Research, and City of Edmonton, has expanded from six to 18 scholarship \npositions. This expansion also serves UAlberta’s goals to expand opportunities for graduate students in \nsustainability-applied research and in professional development training. \nb. Strategy: Build on existing community-based teaching and research partnerships and \ninternships.  \n6 Current on-campus funding opportunities exist through the Sustainability Enhancement Fund and Green Grants out of the \nOffice of Sustainability, the Undergraduate Research Initiative, the Teaching and Learning Enhancement Fund, and the Kule \nInstitute of Advanced Studies. Examples of industry funding could include Mountain Equipment Cooperative, Suncor, \nSyncrude, Save-On Foods, Ag-Funding Consortium, and the Northlands Park Edmonton. Examples of government funding \ncould include the City of Edmonton, Tri-Council federal funding, Networks for Centres of Excellence, the Campus Alberta \nInnovation Chairs (CAIP). Foundation examples include the Real Estate Fund of Alberta, the Gates Foundation, and the \nCatherine Donnelly Foundation. \nA Plan for Deepening Sustainability Education and Scholarship   /  Page 18 of 34 \nThe Director of Sustainability Scholarship and Education, out of the Office of the Provost, could work \nclosely with the University of Alberta’s Centre for Teaching and Learning (CTL) to develop a suite of \ncross-disciplinary case studies/examples that demonstrate how partnered groups (among community \nmembers, university staff, faculty and students, non-governmental and civic organizations) have \nfurthered sustainability. \nThe Community Service-Learning (CSL) office at the University of Alberta offers important opportunities \nfor students to work with community partners on sustainability-related challenges (e.g. watershed \nmanagement or poverty reduction). CSL also offers interdisciplinary spring courses that engage \nstudents with on-the-ground sustainability challenges. For example, a series has been offered on oil \ndevelopment and social and health issues. More CSL courses that explore what sustainability means to \ndifferent organizations could deepen sustainability education. Graduate students in particular requested \nmore graduate-level interdisciplinary CSL courses on sustainability-related topics.  \nThe Undergraduate Research Initiative (URI), in partnership with the Office of Sustainability and \nFacilities & Operations, also offers dedicated sustainability research internships on topics of \nsustainability and all of the URI research internships support interdisciplinary research undergraduate \ntraining.  \nGraduate students have requested more professional development courses related to sustainability. \nThe Faculty of Extension, in particular, is well poised to readily offer specific courses that address \nsustainability practice and that target continuing professionals. For example, they offer a course for \nprofessionals called “Understanding LEED [Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design] for \nBuilding Works”. Greater communication and collaboration between the Faculty of Extension and other \nfaculties could expand relevant and timely non-credit course offerings in the Faculty of Extension that \ncould be turned into credit-based undergraduate and graduate courses.  \nThe Office of Sustainability offers several student intern positions each year. Members of the Students’ \nUnion requested more undergraduate internship opportunities in sustainability, similar to the \nSustainability Scholars program offered at the graduate level.  \nc. Strategy: Explore opportunities to regularly assess and report on sustainability literacy.  \nOne way to know if our students’ knowledge, attitudes and interests around sustainability is shifting is to \ncreate a longitudinal data base on sustainability literacy. Ideally, it would be a very short survey that is \ncomparable to other universities and deemed legitimate and relevant to the University of Alberta. It \ncould be administered annually to a representative sample of University of Alberta students. Survey \nresults may reveal areas where students have greater or less knowledge, which could help inform \nacademic programs and the Office of Sustainability’s engagement programs. \nNext Steps \nThe Office of Sustainability is building an implementation plan for the overall University of Alberta \nSustainability Plan (2016-2020). Academic initiatives will be added to this plan as they emerge in the \ncoming months and years, and the appointed leaders of academic initiatives for sustainability, out of the \nOffice of the Provost, will develop avenues for faculty and students to be engaged in initiatives that \nemerge and grow from “A Plan for Deepening Sustainability Education and Scholarship at the \nUniversity of Alberta 2016-2020”. \nA Plan for Deepening Sustainability Education and Scholarship   /  Page 19 of 34 \nFinal Note \nThe University of Alberta can become a stronger leader in sustainability, regionally, nationally and \ninternationally, by fostering greater cross-fertilization across the disciplines, connecting to on- and off- \ncampus sustainability professionals, supporting start-up research in emerging areas of importance and \nareas of strength, and facilitating partnerships for sustainability tests and interventions. Greater \nUniversity dialogue and consequent common understanding around the complementarity of social \ngoals, such as greater health and wellness, equity, fairness and justice, with inclusive economies and \nrobust and resilient environments can “raise the bar” in the University’s collective ability to convey the \nimportance of sustainability scholarship and education.  \nThis requires assessing our sustainability content and delivery strengths and deciding where we want \nto build our strengths and impact. It is a challenge to plan across 400 academic programs – this will \nrequire more knowledge brokers and bridge builders in the future. A great deal of progress can be \nmade if departments and program leaders evaluate existing programs and courses to identify gaps in \nsustainability content, remove outdated material, avoid unnecessary repetition, share learning materials \n(such as curricular repositories), and co-teach across faculties and departments. This plan offers a \nsuite of suggestions and ideas for academic sustainability initiatives, and a roadmap to better planning \nfor the future for the University of Alberta to have a more positive impact on the world.  \nA Plan for Deepening Sustainability Education and Scholarship   /  Page 20 of 34 \nAppendix A: Summary of Workshops and Consultations \nA total of 78 individuals, representing 17 Faculties and 24 Departments were engaged in range of \nconversations and dialogues. Details about these activities are outlined below. \n1. October 2014 Vision Workshop \n22 Social Sciences, Arts and Humanities professors gathered at Campus Saint-Jean on October 17, \n2014 for a workshop on “Sustainability, Environment and Social Justice in the Social Sciences and \nHumanities at the University of Alberta”. The workshop was organized by Naomi Krogman, Director of \nSustainability Scholarship and Education, Office of the Provost and Professor in the Department of \nResource Economics and Environmental Sociology. Workshop assistants were Monica Gruezmacher, \nAdjunct Faculty in the Faculty of Extension, and Apryl Bergstrom, Research Assistant, Office of the \nProvost. \nWorkshop goals: \n• Identify strengths and gaps in our theme areas; sustainability, environment and social justice \n• Discuss university and faculty-led support that contributes to effective collaboration between \nSocial Sciences, Humanities, and Arts professors in regards to academic programming, course \ndevelopment, supporting a community of practice and identifying funds available for \ninterdisciplinary research. \n• Inform the academic portion of the Sustainability Plan for University of Alberta that is to start in \n2017 (the current plan is in effect through 2016). \n• Encourage the submission of a Cluster Grant letter of intent to the Kule Institute of Advanced \nStudies. \nWorkshop Organization \nThe workshop consisted of three work sessions: 1) Sustainability research, teaching and practice; 2) \nthe University of Alberta’s future in sustainability and interdisciplinary scholarship; and 3) Goals and \nStrategies for curriculum and research components in the University of Alberta’s Sustainability Plan. \nThe topics and questions discussed during these sessions are outlined in more detail below: \nTopics in work session 1: Sustainability research, teaching and practice \n• Funding opportunities and challenges \n• Content and development of academic programs and courses \n• Challenges in creating a community of practice \n• Challenges of interdisciplinary research \nInterview questions in work session 2: UAlberta’s future in sustainability and interdisciplinary \nscholarship \nA Plan for Deepening Sustainability Education and Scholarship   /  Page 21 of 34 \n• What are sustainability related themes that the U of A should have given the size, rank and \nsister campuses of our institution? \n• What are the strengths in sustainability scholarship for the faculties of Social Sciences, Arts and \nHumanities? Other faculties? \n• What are the gaps in sustainability scholarship for the faculties of Social Sciences, Arts and \nHumanities? Other faculties? \n• What theme areas for academic programs would be ideal for the U of A to offer or in which to \ninvest? \nWork session 3: Goals and strategies for curriculum and research components in UAlberta’s \nSustainability Plan \n• Participants individually wrote and then discussed their goals, modifications, additions and \nstrategies regarding curriculum and research in the University of Alberta’s new Sustainability \nPlan (2016-2020). \n2. Sustainability Plan Workshops \nSustainability Plan workshops from January to April 2015 with two groups:  \n1. The Office of Sustainability Academic Advisory Committee (OSAAC)7  \n2. A group composed of undergraduate and graduate students, non-academic staff, faculty, \nprofessional staff, alumni and community members. Participants were recruited through \npromotions by the Office of Sustainability. They signed up through an online survey. Additional \npeople were identified as responsible parties in education and research, and they were also \ninvited to attend the workshops. \nEach group attended two workshops between January and April 2015. First, a Vision workshop was \nheld to try to come up with a shared vision for sustainability in 2020 at the University of Alberta, with \nrespect to education and research. This was later followed by an Obstacles and Strategies workshop, \nwhere participants suggested ways of overcoming obstacles and developing strategies to help realize \nour shared vision about sustainability in education and research within the next five years. \n3. Individual Consultations \nConsultations with Deans, Associate Deans \nThe Dean, Associate Dean, Research and Associate Dean, Academic (or their equivalents) were sent \nthe questions below. They were invited to meet with Naomi Krogman to discuss what they would like to \nsee in education and research when it comes to sustainability, both within their faculties and throughout \n7 In spring 2015, the Office of Sustainability Academic Advisory Committee (OSAAC) was renamed the Provost's \nAcademic Advisory Council on Sustainability (PAACS). \nA Plan for Deepening Sustainability Education and Scholarship   /  Page 22 of 34 \nthe university. Detailed notes were taken at each of the consultations and sent back to the Deans and \nAssociate Deans for review. Those who were interested in sharing their ideas but were unable to meet \nwere invited to submit written answers instead. \nQuestions sent to Deans and Associate Deans: \n1) What academic areas would you like to enhance in your faculty that relate to sustainability?  \n2) What sustainability area(s), if any, do you wish to build up in your faculty, in terms of curriculum \nor strengthened programming, in your faculty? Are there specific program names or course titles \nyou can suggest? \n3) What are the key threats, if any, to the current sustainability-related courses and academic \nprograms you have in your faculty? \n4) What are key opportunities and barriers for faculty interested in sustainability-related research? \n5) When it comes to sustainability at the University of Alberta, what do you want to see in \ncurriculum or research in five years?  \na. What obstacles might stand in the way of achieving this vision? \nb. What strategies can be used to address these obstacles and achieve our goals? \nc. What resources or support might be needed to achieve our goals? \n6) How could we expand opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students to research and \nlearn about sustainability initiatives on campus, as a living lab? To learn about sustainability \nmore broadly? \n7) What are some of the core issues in sustainability in which you would like to see more \npartnership with other faculties (if any)? With other organizations or institutions? \n8) To what extent are faculty members or student (groups) already engaged in teaching or \nresearch related to sustainability? \n9) Can you identify faculty and students in subjects close to sustainability issues, not yet engaged \nin sustainability? \n10) What can be done to better facilitate collaborations across faculty boundaries on sustainability \ntopics in teaching and research? \n11) Are there one or two major sustainability projects that your faculty might wish to pursue? \nConsultations with Chairs or Coordinators of sustainability-related programs \nThe Chairs or Coordinators of programs that were identified as being sustainability-related8 were sent \nthe questions below. They were invited to either meet with Naomi Krogman to discuss sustainability in \neducation and research with respect to their programs, or to submit written responses to the questions. \nQuestions sent to Chairs or Coordinators: \n1) What academic areas would you like to enhance in this program that relate to sustainability?  \n8 See Appendix B for a list of academic programs that were identified as being sustainability-related. \nA Plan for Deepening Sustainability Education and Scholarship   /  Page 23 of 34 \n2) What sustainability area(s), if any, do you wish to build up in your faculty, in terms of curriculum \nor strengthened programming? Are there specific program names or course titles you can \nsuggest? \n3) What are the key threats, if any, to this program? \n4) When it comes to sustainability at the University of Alberta, what do you want to see in \ncurriculum or research in five years (your suggestions can cross programs, faculties)?  \na. What obstacles might stand in the way of achieving this vision? \nb. What strategies can be used to address these obstacles and achieve our goals? \nc. What resources or support might be needed to achieve our goals? \n5) What are some of the core issues in sustainability in which you would like to see more \npartnership with other programs, faculties, organizations or institutions? \nDetailed notes were taken during each of these consultations. \n4. Luncheon Discussion on Academic Initiatives in Sustainability at the \nUniversity of Alberta \nOn February 29, 2016, 21 faculty members, staff and students attended a workshop over lunch to \ndiscuss academic initiatives in sustainability at the University of Alberta. \nParticipants gathered in separate groups to discuss the following four topics: \n1) The potential for a sustainability/climate change/public policy institute at the University of Alberta \nand the kinds of activities it would promote \n2) Ways to inform new initiative, “Indigenous issues, cultivating citizenship and sustainability: \nTransformative learning opportunities” \n3) Creating a system to foster better coordination and information sharing across instructors and \nresearchers on sustainability issues \n4) How to encourage greater planning for program and curriculum change in light of important \nsustainability topics, student interest, U of A and branch campus strengths, and other post-\nsecondary institutes in the Province \nDetailed notes were taken at each of these discussions and were used to inform the draft document, “A \nPlan for Deepening Sustainability Education and Scholarship at the University of Alberta”. \nA Plan for Deepening Sustainability Education and Scholarship   /  Page 24 of 34 \nAppendix B: People consulted \nThe goals and strategies in this document originated from several consultations and workshops \nfocused on education and research held between October 2014 and April 2015.

Not so long ago, we had \nno idea how big a shift it would take. In the future, people will wonder how \nwe swiveled so quickly to meet the challenge. But this report shows just how \nquickly it can be done. It is more than possible, it’s already happening.\nThe fi rst Sustainability Plan was formulated in 2011. It builds on our strong \nfoundation in energy management, recycling and community-building to help \nus reach further. It articulated a vision and focused our actions on new goals. \nWith a plan in place, progress has accelerated and together we have \naccomplished so much more than we set out to. As the fi rst Sustainability Plan \ncomes to an end, the stage is set to push further, dream bigger, reach higher.\nRead on to see how far we’ve come.

The \nFestival of Teaching spent a full year sharing professors’ experience in teaching sustainability. \nCommunity Service-Learning helps professors take their students out of the classroom to \naccelerate their learning with real-world experience working in community groups and local \nbusinesses. \nNew programs for undergrads and graduate students introduced in 2014 complete the \ngenerational shift. The Certifi cate in Sustainability means students in nine faculties can gain \npractical knowledge and professional development in sustainability, regardless of their major. \nSustainability Scholars provides funding and mentorship to motivated graduate students who \nwant to take their research into the city to see real change.

Now, more than ever before, sustainability is on the minds of the people \ndoing this work.\nFrom a successful paper and cardboard recycling program started over 35 years ago, the \nuniversity has taken on more and more responsibility for carefully managing resources. \nCentralized procurement ensures resources are reused and recycled across the institution. \nRecycling services have grown to include construction waste, electronics and organics. UAlberta \nis contributing to Edmonton’s world-class waste management system by helping develop an \nanaerobic digestion facility that will process 1500 tonnes of our organics annually by 2017.\nAs the university grows, its portfolio of green buildings gets ever larger. It now counts teaching \nfacilities, a performing arts centre, research labs, a physical activity centre, century-old renovations \nand state-of-the-art brand new buildings. Amid these buildings are community gardens \nbringing our neighbours to campus and supporting local food security.

Since 1975, the university has had a successful energy management program \nthat has saved $320 million and avoided 2.3 million tonnes of greenhouse gas emissions. In \nrecent years, the plan has implemented intelligent monitoring systems and new technologies \nto accelerate savings even further.\nUAlberta is also home to one of North America’s largest campus-based district energy systems. \nWith natural gas power and mass distribution, the DES provides effi  cient heating, cooling and \nelectricity to over 2 million square meters of university and hospital space. Installing high \neffi  ciency turbine generators and co-generation is driving greater savings.\nAll of this provided the strong foundation the university needs to meet the challenge of climate \nchange head on by moving boldly into renewable energy. A new building on South Campus \ngave the opportunity to experiment with building-integrated photovoltaic solar panels. This \nexperience enabled the new 122 kW solar electricity system on Augustana Campus’ Jeanne \n& Peter Lougheed Performing Arts Centre, the largest such system in Canada.
