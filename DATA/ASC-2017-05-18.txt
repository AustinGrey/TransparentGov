A new template for committee terms of reference was developed to provide standardization across committees, clarity on the role of the committee, and improved transparency delegation and sub-delegation of authority. She noted some of the implications for ASC including the inclusion of more elected GFC academic members and the election of a Vice-Chair, ideally a GFC member. GFC Executive will be receiving regular reports on the implementation of the recommendations, with the intention that some committee terms of reference will be coming for approval as early as Fall 2017. Dr Burshtyn provided a brief overview of the comments made at GFC during the consideration of the report and indicated there was general support for the changes being proposed. GFC was assured that the new terms of reference were in a draft stage and would be going first to the standing committees themselves for revision and then to full GFC for final approval. Dr Geddes assured ASC that most changes being proposed specific to the committee were to streamline processes, address negative perceptions, align committee expertise, and formalize the role ASC is already fulfilling. It was noted that GFC Academic Planning Committee was in support of changes impacting both it and ASC. The Chair noted that the committee will be working through the draft terms over the next few meetings and SOS will also be having discussions about the ad hoc committee’s report over the coming months.

The impact will be to have greater \nclarity for students, faculty and staff in the administration and conduct \nand outcomes of examinations in thesis-based programs. \nThe Impact of the Proposal is The conduct of graduate examinations holds extremely high stakes for \nindividual students and presents significant reputational risk for the \nfaculty, program and institution. A major revision the Supervision and \nStructure of Examining Committees in the Graduate Program Manual \nwas approved by FGSR Council in May 2012. Subsequently in May 2013 \nthe authority for approval of supervisors, supervisory committees, \nexternal examiners and examining committees was delegated to the \ndisciplinary department/Faculty of the program and the change to the \nCalendar governing examinations was approved by FGSR Council \nOctober 2013 appearing in the 2014-2015 Calendar.  A number of areas \nhave come to light that have caused problems due to apparent \ncontradictions, gaps and/or confusing language.  The FSGR Policy \nReview Committee undertook a comprehensive review of the \nSupervision and Examination regulations.  The resulting proposal \naddresses the organization and clarity of the policy as well as changes to \npolicy as follow: \n• The chair of doctoral examinations cannot be an examiner to \nremove issues of bias that have arisen \n• One supervisor of a supervisory team must meet the employment \ncriteria of a UofA examiner \n• Size limits for examination committees are set to prevent \nextraordinarily long examinations in light of current flexibility in \nsupervisory committee composition and the need to fulfill \nexaminer composition balance. \n• A revamped section on “Conduct of Thesis and Candidacy \nExams” was added back to provide consistency across the \nacademy. \n• Guidance added for outcome of “Conditional Pass” for doctoral \ncandidacy exam to lessen the rates of students not meeting the \nconditions. \nReplaces/Revises (eg, policies, Revises Supervision and Examinations policy as found in the FGSR \nItem No. 6 \nGFC ACADEMIC STANDARDS COMMITTEE \nFor the Meeting of June 15, 2016 \nresolutions) section of the Calendar. \nTimeline/Implementation Date Effective July 1, 2018.

In forming a \nsupervisory committee, the department should consider \nthe rank and experience of the prospective members, \ntheir publications and other demonstrations of \ncompetence in the subject area or field of specialization, \nand the prospective members' experience in graduate \nsupervision.  \nAttention should be paid to the qualifications of the \ncommittee members as examiners to ensure the \ncomposition of the examination committee will be \nappropriate as they are ex-officio members of doctoral \nexamining committees.   \nThe supervisory committee is chaired by one of the \nsupervisors. \nCompliance with the University of Alberta's Conflict \nPolicy - Conflict of Interest and Commitment, and \nInstitutional Conflict - is mandatory. \nThe supervisor is responsible for ensuring committee \nmeetings are held and making arrangements. The \ncommittee shall have a formal regular meeting with the \nstudent at least once a year.  The department should \nmaintain a record of meetings that have occurred and \nwhen students who are not on an approved leave fail to \nrespond to requests to schedule a committee meeting. \n[Moved above] \nhttps://policiesonline.ualberta.ca/PoliciesProcedures/Policies/Conflict-Policy--Conflict-of-Interest-and-Commitment-and-Institutional-Conflict.pdf\nhttps://policiesonline.ualberta.ca/PoliciesProcedures/Policies/Conflict-Policy--Conflict-of-Interest-and-Commitment-and-Institutional-Conflict.pdf\nhttps://policiesonline.ualberta.ca/PoliciesProcedures/Policies/Conflict-Policy--Conflict-of-Interest-and-Commitment-and-Institutional-Conflict.pdf\nhttps://policiesonline.ualberta.ca/PoliciesProcedures/Policies/Conflict-Policy--Conflict-of-Interest-and-Commitment-and-Institutional-Conflict.pdf\nPage 6 of 25 \nsupervisory committee, the department should consider \nthe rank and experience of the prospective members, \ntheir publications and other demonstrations of \ncompetence in the subject area or field of specialization, \nand the prospective members' experience in graduate \nsupervision. \nFor doctoral students, the department shall appoint the \nsupervisory committee well in advance of the candidacy \nexamination. \nResolving Conflicts in Supervisor-Student \nRelationships  \nThe relationship between students and supervisors is \nnormally close and long-lasting. At times, conflicts may \narise between a student and the supervisor. In such cases, \nthe first step must be to try to resolve the conflict or \nmisunderstanding informally. This is more likely to be \nsuccessful if attended to as early as possible. The \nsupervisor and student should discuss the problem \ntogether. The supervisor should document the \ndiscussions and keep a record of any agreements made. In \nthe event of a conflict the graduate coordinator should be \nnotified as early as possible. \nIt is the responsibility of the graduate coordinator to \narrange for consultation and mediation. The graduate \ncoordinator or the parties involved may request advice \nand/or mediation assistance from their Faculty, the FGSR, \nand/or other appropriate services, such as the Student \nOmbudservice. The student and supervisors shall not be \nrequired to participate in informal resolution against \ntheir wishes if either party's behaviour towards the other \nwarrants a complaint under the Code of Student \nBehaviour, the Discrimination and Harassment Policy, or \nother University policy. \nIf informal resolution is unsuccessful or inappropriate, \nand the graduate coordinator determines that the \nsupervisor-student relationship is beyond repair, the \ndepartment will attempt in good faith to work with the \nstudent to find alternative supervision within the \ndepartment, and will keep the FGSR apprised of these \nefforts. \nWhere the supervisor has been providing funding to the \nstudent, the funding should continue for a period of at \nleast 30 days from the date on which the graduate \ncoordinator determines that the supervisor-student \nrelationship is beyond repair. \nIf the best arrangements of the department and the FGSR \nfail to meet the expectations of the student, the student \nmay choose to withdraw without prejudice. If the student \nrefuses to accept the supervision provided, or if no \nFor doctoral students, the department shall appoint the \nsupervisory committee well in advance of the candidacy \nexamination. \n[Moved above to just before Supervisory \nCommittees] \nPage 7 of 25 \nsupervision can be secured, then the student is not \nfulfilling the academic requirement of having a supervisor \nand may, on academic grounds, be required to withdraw. \nThe Structure of Examining Committees  \nFormal examining committees are required for thesis-\nbased master’s final examination, doctoral candidacy \nexaminations, and doctoral final examinations. Members \nof these examining committees perform two functions: 1) \nthey bring disciplinary knowledge and expertise to the \nassessment of the thesis, and 2) they ensure that the \nUniversity’s expectations are met regarding the conduct \nof the examination, adherence to all relevant policies, and \nthe suitability of the thesis for the degree.  \nThe Chair  \nEvery examining committee must have a chair who is not \na supervisor but is a member of the student’s home \ndepartment. The chair should have sufficient experience \nof graduate examinations to be able to allow the \nexamination to be conducted in a fair manner, and is \nresponsible for moderating the discussion and directing \nquestions. It is the chair’s responsibility to ensure that \ndepartmental and FGSR regulations relating to the final \nexamination are followed. If the chair is not an examiner, \nthen the chair does not vote.  \nThe FGSR encourages, and for doctoral examinations \nstrongly recommends, that committee chairs not be \nexaminers.  \nExaminers  \nExaminers are full voting members of the examining \ncommittee. With the exception of the Dean, FGSR, the \nDean of the department’s Faculty, or a Pro Dean (Dean’s \nrepresentative), who may participate fully in the \nexamination, persons other than the examiners may \nattend only with the prior approval of the Dean, FGSR, the \nDean of the department’s Faculty, or the chair of the \nexamining committee. With the possible exception of the \nPro Deans, all examiners must be either active in the \ngeneral subject area of the student’s research, or bring \nrelevant expertise to the assessment of the thesis.  \nThe Role and Structure of Examining \nCommittees  \nFormal examining committees are required for thesis-\nbased master’s final examination, doctoral candidacy \nexaminations, and doctoral final examinations. Members \nof these examining committees perform two functions: 1) \nthey bring knowledge and expertise to the assessment of \nthe thesis, and 2) they ensure that the University’s \nexpectations are met regarding the conduct of the \nexamination, adherence to all relevant policies, and the \nsuitability of the thesis for the degree.  \nThe Chair  \nEvery examining committee must have a chair who is not \na supervisor and is a faculty member with experience \nsupervising graduate students. The chair should have \nsufficient experience of graduate examinations to be able \nto allow the examination to be conducted in a fair \nmanner. The chair is responsible for moderating the \ndiscussion and directing questions. It is the chair’s \nresponsibility to ensure that departmental and FGSR \nregulations relating to the final examination are followed. \nIf the chair is not an examiner, then the chair does not \nvote.  \nThe committee chair is not an examiner for doctoral \nexaminations.  See Size and Composition of Examining \nCommittees for the requirements for each examination.  \nThe chair should not have real or apparent conflict of \ninterest with the student or any of the examiners.  \nExaminers  \nExaminers are full voting members of the examining \ncommittee. All examiners must be either active in the \ngeneral subject area of the student’s research or bring \nrelevant expertise to the assessment of the thesis.  \n[Deleted sentences already found under Attendance at \nExaminations, below] \nCategories of Examiners and Eligibility \nThere are four types of examiners: ex-officio examiner, \narm’s length examiner, University of Alberta examiner \nand External examiner. \nEx-officio Examiners \nPage 8 of 25 \nArm’s Length Examiners  \nAn arm’s length examiner must not be (or have been) a \nmember of the supervisory committee, or have been \nconnected with the thesis research in a significant way.  \nThe examiner should not have been associated with the \nstudent, outside of usual contact in courses or other non-\nthesis activities within the University, nor be related to \nthe student or supervisor(s).  \nExcept in special circumstances (fully justified in writing \nto the Dean of the department’s Faculty), an arm’s length \nexaminer should not be a close collaborator of the \nsupervisor(s) within the last six years.  \nArm’s length examiners who have served on a student’s \ncandidacy examination committee do not lose their arm’s \nlength status as a result, and are eligible to serve as arm’s \nlength examiners on the student’s doctoral final \nexamination if the other conditions of being arm’s length \nremain unchanged.  \nIn the case of a doctoral final examination, the required \nExternal (i.e., the arm’s length examiner from outside the \nUniversity of Alberta) is, by definition, an arm’s length \nexaminer. \nEvery examining committee requires a minimum number \nof arm’s length examiners: At least one for a master’s final \nexamination, at least two for a candidacy examination, \nand at least two for a doctoral final examination. \nCompliance with the University of Alberta’s Conflict Policy \n- Conflict of Interest and Commitment, and Institutional \nConflict is mandatory.  \nEx-Officio Examiners  \nThe supervisor(s), and, for doctoral students, the other \nmembers of the student’s supervisory committee, are ex-\nofficio members of the examining committee.  \n[Moved from below] \nThe supervisor(s) and, for doctoral students, the other \nmembers of the student’s supervisory committee are ex-\nofficio members of the examining committee. \nBy definition, no individual can be both an ex-officio and \nan arm’s length examiner on the same examining \ncommittee. \nArm’s Length Examiners  \nAn arm’s length examiner is knowledgeable in the field \nand comes fresh to the examination. They must not be (or \nhave been) a member of the supervisory committee, or \nhave been connected with the thesis research in a \nsignificant way. The examiner should not have been \nassociated with the student, outside of usual contact in \ncourses or other non-thesis activities within the \nUniversity, nor be related to the student or supervisor(s).  \nThe arm’s length examiners should not be a former \nsupervisor or student of the supervisor(s). \nExcept in special circumstances (fully justified in writing \nto the Dean of the department’s Faculty), an arm’s length \nexaminer should not be an active collaborator of the \nsupervisor(s) (see Conflict of Interest Guidelines, below ) \nArm’s length examiners who have served on a student’s \ncandidacy examination committee do not lose their arm’s \nlength status as a result, and are eligible to serve as arm’s \nlength examiners on the student’s doctoral final \nexamination if the other conditions of being arm’s length \nremain unchanged.  \nExternal Examiner \nAn external examiner from outside the University of \nAlberta is required for doctoral thesis examinations. In \naddition to being an arm’s length examiner this examiner \nmust fulfill additional criteria as described under “Final \nDoctoral Examination … Inviting the External Examiner or \nReader” in the Calendar. \n[Moved above] \nUniversity of Alberta Examiners \nPage 9 of 25 \n[Restored from earlier Calendar wording and revised] \nMinimum Membership Requirements for \nExamining Committees  \nAt least half of the examiners on every examining \ncommittee must have a degree which is equivalent to, or \nhigher than, the degree being examined.  \nAt least half of the examiners on every examining \ncommittee must be tenured, tenure-track, or retired \nUniversity of Alberta faculty members, or Faculty Service \nOfficers, (current or retired categories A1.1, A1.3, or \ncurrent category C1.1, as defined in the University of \nAlberta’s Recruitment Policy (Appendix A) Definition and \nCategories of Academic Staff and Colleagues).  \nMinimum Size of an Examining Committee  \nBy definition, no individual can be both an arm’s length \nexaminer and an ex-officio examiner on the same \nexamining committee.  \nThe minimum size of a master’s final examining \ncommittee is three. This minimum size condition is \nautomatically met except when the student has one \nsupervisor, no supervisory committee, and there is only \none arm’s length examiner on the examining committee. \nIn this case, the examining committee requires at least \none more examiner.  \nThe University of Alberta examiner is a tenured, tenure-\ntrack, or retired University of Alberta faculty member, or \nFaculty Service Officer, (current or retired categories \nA1.1, A1.3, or current category C1.1, as defined in the \nUniversity of Alberta’s Recruitment Policy (Appendix A) \nDefinition and Categories of Academic Staff and \nColleagues). \nConflict of Interest Guidelines  for \nSupervisory and Examination Committees \nThe key relationships are: the supervisor to the student; \nthe supervisor to the other committee members; and the \nstudent to the committee members. There must be no \nconflict of interest in these relationships, as defined by \nthe University of Alberta policy.  Any personal or \nprofessional relationships that alter or affect this \nacademic relationship may constitute a conflict-of-\ninterest.  \nIt is a best practice to request examiners and the chair \ndeclare any potential conflicts of interest prior to \napproval of the examination committee. Where potential \nconflicts-of-interest emerge, the matter may be referred \nto an Associate Dean at FGSR for advice on how to best \nmanage unavoidable conflicts of interest. \nSize and Composition of Examining Committees \nFor all examination committees, Aat least half of the \nexaminers must have a degree equivalent to or higher \nthan the degree being examined.  \nFor all examination committees, at least half of the \nexaminers must fulfill the criteria as a University of \nAlberta examiner as tenured, tenure-track, or retired \nUniversity of Alberta faculty members, or Faculty Service \nOfficers (see above under Categories of Examiners and \nEligibility).  \n[Moved above under Categories of Examiners and \nEligibility] \nMaster’s Thesis Examination Committee \n• The minimum size of a master’s final examining \ncommittee is three.

Matters specific \nto each type of examination are detailed in the sections \nthat follow.  Programs may have additional regulations in \ntheir program guidelines. \n• The student may be required to give a presentation \nprior to the examination.  The presentation may be \npublic or only for the examining committee (and \nothers approved to attend the examination—see \nAttendance at Doctoral Examinations, above). \n• If a public seminar is held before the examination, \ntypically the examiners do not ask questions until the \nexamination itself begins. \n• At the start of the examination the chair should \nreview the procedures as detailed by the program’s \nguidelines for the examination including the order of \nexaminers, number of rounds of questions,the length \nof time allotted to each examiner and whether \ninterjections by other examiners are \npermitted.  Departmental examination procedures \nshould have flexibility to adjust accordingly when \nthere are large supervisory committees so as not to \nextend the questioning portion of the examination \nbeyond a reasonable duration (2 hours for master’s \nand 3 hours for doctoral examinations).  \n• The student may be asked to leave the room while the \norder of examiners is determined, and the student’s \nacademic record is reviewed by the supervisor for the \ncommittee.  Typically the order of examiners is the \nExternal if applicable, the arm’s length examiners, the \nPage 14 of 25 \nThesis Based Master’s Program Examination  \nDecision of the Master’s Final Examining Committee: \nThe decision of the examining committee will be based \nboth on the content of the thesis and on the student’s \nability to defend it. The final examination may result in \none of the following outcomes:  \n• Adjourned  \n• Pass  \n• Pass subject to revisions  \n• Fail  \nThere is no provision for a final examination to be “passed \nsupervisory committee members and then the \nsupervisor.  The Examiners may seek clarification at \nthis time regarding exam procedures. \n• If academic misconduct is suspected, an Associate \nDean, FGSR should be consulted prior to the exam. \n• For thesis examinations the questioning should focus \non establishing the quality of the thesis [or thesis \nsubstitute] and the student’s breadth and depth of \nunderstanding at a level appropriate to the degree \nqualification.  Expectations for a Candidacy \nexamination are detailed in the program’s guidelines. \n• When the questions have concluded, the chair should \nask the student if they have any final comments they \nwould like to add. \nDeliberation: \n• The student is required to leave the room and will be \nasked to take their personal belongings including \nelectronic devices with them. \n• The deliberations are confidential proceedings. The \ncommittee will agree on the report to be provided to \nthe student with the outcome of the examination. \n• The examiners are asked to give their opinions on the \nquality of the thesis and the defense, or performance \nin the candidacy examination, in the same order as \nquestioning occurred. All examiners must provide \ntheir opinion before a final decision is made. \n• The options of the outcomes from the vote are \ndetailed for each type of examination. \n• If the outcome of the first vote does not result in a \ndecision (eg. two of five examiners vote to fail), the \nchair will allow for further discussion and attempt to \nreach a decision.  Only in cases where a decision \ncannot be reached in a reasonable time will the \nstudent be informed and matter referred to the Dean \nFGSR, who will determine the appropriate course of \naction. \n• The chair of the Examination Committee may sign the \nthesis examination form on behalf of an examiner \nwho is participating from a remote location.  \nThesis Based Master’s Program Examination  \nEach department offering a thesis-based Master’s degree \nis required to establish detailed examination procedures \nfor final examinations. These procedures must be made \navailable publicly.  \nDecision of the Master’s Final Examining Committee: \nThe decision of the examining committee will be based \nboth on the content of the thesis and on the student’s \nability to defend it.

The commentary should \nnot be given to the student prior to the examination. \nIf the thesis is judged by the External Examiner to fall into \nthe “Unacceptable” category, then the External Examiner \nis asked to contact the Dean of the FGSR immediately, \nsince the final examination may have to be postponed.  \nThe Examination: The examining committee should \nconduct a final examination, based largely on the thesis. \nThe graduate coordinator should ensure that the chair of \nthe examining committee, the student, and all examiners \nhave a final copy of the thesis at the examination.  \nThe student should make a brief presentation about the \nthesis.  \nThe most time should be allotted to the arm’s length \nexaminers, including the External Examiner, while the \nleast time is allocated to the supervisor(s).  \nNo final decision should be made without each examiner \nhaving given an opinion.  \nDecision of the Doctoral Final Examining Committee: The \ndecision of the examining committee will be based both \non the content of the thesis and on the student’s ability to \ndefend it. The final examination may result in one of the \nfollowing outcomes:  \n• Adjourned  \n• Pass  \n• Pass subject to revisions  \n• Fail  \nThere is no provision for a final examination to be “passed \nsubject to major revisions”.  \nIf the Examining Committee fails to reach a decision, the \ndepartment will refer the matter to the Dean, FGSR, who \n• Unacceptable without major revisions: In this case, \nthe External Reader contacts the Dean of the FGSR \nimmediately by email as the examination may need to be \npostponed.  \nThe questions or commentary will be made available to \nthe student for the first time during the examination and \nthe committee will evaluate the student’s answers as part \nof the examination.  \nExternal Examiners: Attend the examination in person. \nIn the letter of invitation, the External Examiner is \nrequested to prepare and send to the Graduate \nCoordinator, at least one week in advance of the \nexamination, an evaluation of the thesis placing it \ntemporarily in one of the following categories:  \n• the thesis is acceptable with minor or no revisions,  \n• the External Examiner wishes to reserve judgment until \nafter the examination, or  \n• the thesis is unacceptable without major revisions.  \nIn the first two cases, the External Examiner is asked to \nprovide a brief written commentary (approximately two \nto three pages) on the structure, methodology, quality, \nsignificance and findings of the thesis for the reference of \nboth the student and supervisor.

A majority of examiners must \nagree to an outcome of Adjourned. The final examination \nshould be adjourned in the following situations:  \n• The revisions to the thesis are sufficiently substantial \nthat it will require further research or experimentation or \nmajor reworking of sections, or if the committee is so \ndissatisfied with the general presentation of the thesis \nthat it will require a reconvening of the examining \ncommittee. In such circumstances the committee cannot \npass the student, and must adjourn the examination.  \n• The committee is dissatisfied with the student’s oral \npresentation and defence of the thesis, even if the thesis \nitself is acceptable with or without minor revisions.  \n• Compelling, extraordinary circumstances such as a \nsudden medical emergency taking place during the \nexamination.  \n• Discovery of possible offences under the Code of Student \nBehaviour after the examination has started.  \nIf the examination is adjourned, the committee should:  \n• Specify in writing to the student, with as much precision \nas possible, the nature of the deficiencies and, in the case \nof revisions to the thesis, the extent of the revisions \nrequired. Where the oral defence is unsatisfactory, it may \nbe necessary to arrange some discussion periods with the \nstudent prior to reconvening the examination.  \n• Decide upon a date to reconvene. If the date of the \nreconvened examination depends upon the completion of \na research task or a series of discussions, it should be \nmade clear which committee members will decide on the \nappropriate date to reconvene. The final date set for \nreconvening shall be no later than six months from the \ndate of the examination. This new examination must be \nheld within six months of the initial examination.  \n• Make it clear to the student what will be required by \nway of approval before the examination is reconvened \n(e.g., approval of the committee chair or supervisor, \napproval of the entire committee, or of select members of \nthe committee).  \n• Specify the supervision and assistance the student may \nexpect from the committee members in meeting the \nnecessary revisions.  \n• Advise the Dean of the department’s Faculty following \nthe procedures established for this purpose.  \n• Advise the FGSR in writing of the adjournment and the \nconditions.  \n• When the date is set for the adjourned final examination, \nthe department will notify the Dean of the department’s \nFaculty and the FGSR.

If the student passes the examination, \nthe department should submit a completed Thesis \nApproval/Program Completion form to the FGSR. If one of \nthe examiners fails the student, that examiner does not \nhave to sign this form.  \nPass Subject to Revisions: All or all but one of the \nexaminers must agree to an outcome of Pass Subject to \nRevisions. The student has satisfactorily defended the \nthesis but the revisions to the thesis are sufficiently minor \nthat it will not require a reconvening of the examining \ncommittee. If the examining committee agrees to a “Pass \nsubject to revisions” for the student, the chair of the \nexamining committee must provide in writing, within five \nworking days of the examination, to the Dean, FGSR, the \ngraduate coordinator and the student. \n• the reasons for this outcome,  \n• the details of the required revisions,  \n• the approval mechanism for meeting the requirement \nfor revisions (e.g., approval of the examining committee \nchair or supervisor, or approval of the entire examining \ncommittee, or select members of the committee), and  \n• the supervision and assistance the student can expect to \nreceive from committee members.  \nThe student must make the revisions within six months of \nthe date of the final examination. Once the required \nrevisions have been made and approved, the department \nshall submit a completed Thesis Approval/Program \nCompletion form to the FGSR indicating “pass subject to \nrevisions”. If one of the examiners fails the student that \nexaminer does not have to sign the form. If the required \nrevisions have not been made and approved by the end of \nthe six months deadline, the outcome of the examination \nis a Fail.  \nFail: All or all but one of the examiners must agree to an \noutcome of Fail. If the examination result is a Fail, no \nmember of the examining committee signs the Thesis \nApproval/Completion form.  \nWhen the outcome is a Fail, the committee chair will \nprovide the reasons for this decision to the graduate \ncoordinator. The department will then provide this \nreport, together with its recommendation for the \nstudent’s program, to the Dean of the department’s \nFaculty, the FGSR, and to the student.  \nAn Associate Dean, FGSR will normally arrange to meet \nwith the student and with the graduate coordinator \nbefore acting upon any department recommendation that \naffects the student’s academic standing. \nPass: Pass is the decision given when the only revisions \nrequired are typographical or minor editorial changes. All \nor all but one of the examiners must agree to an outcome \nof Pass. If the student passes the examination, the \ndepartment should submit a completed Thesis \nApproval/Program Completion form to the FGSR. If one of \nthe examiners fails the student, that examiner does not \nhave to sign this form.  \nPass Subject to Revisions: All or all but one of the \nexaminers must agree to an outcome of Pass Subject to \nRevisions.

Once the required \nrevisions have been made and approved, the department \nshall submit a completed Thesis Approval/Program \nCompletion form to the FGSR indicating the committee \ndecision was “pass subject to revisions”.

A major revision the Supervision and \nStructure of Examining Committees in the Graduate Program Manual was approved by FGSR Council in May \n2012. Subsequently in May 2013 the authority for approval of supervisors, supervisory committees, \nexternal examiners and examining committees was delegated to the disciplinary department/Faculty of the \nprogram and the change to the Calendar governing examinations was approved by FGSR Council October \n2013 appearing in the 2014-2015 Calendar.  A number of areas have come to light that have caused \nproblems due to apparent contradictions, gaps and/or confusing language.  The revisions are not intended \nto significantly alter the policies governing examinations but to clarify the policies, elaborate on procedures, \nand update graduate level examination procedures given changes to practices and technologies. \nApproved: FGSR Council, May 17, 2017 \nItem No. 7 \nGFC ACADEMIC STANDARDS COMMITTEE \nFor the Meeting of June 15, 2017 \nOUTLINE OF ISSUE \nDiscussion Item \nAgenda Title: Draft Terms of Reference for the GFC Academic Standards Committee (standing item) \nItem   \nProposed by Tammy Hopper, Chair, GFC Academic Standards Committee \nPresenter Tammy Hopper, Chair, GFC Academic Standards Committee \nDetails \nResponsibility General Faculties Council \nThe Purpose of the item is \n(please be specific) \nTo continue the review and refinement of draft committee terms of \nreference \nTimeline/Implementation Date Fall 2017 \nSupplementary Notes and \ncontext \nEngagement and Routing (Include meeting dates) \nParticipation: \n(parties who have seen the \nproposal and in what capacity) \n<For further information see \nthe link posted on \nthe Governance Toolkit section \nStudent Participation Protocol> \nThose who are actively participating: \n• GFC Academic Standards Committee – May 18, 2017, June 15, \n2017 \nAlignment/Compliance \nAlignment with Guiding \nDocuments \nFor the Public Good \nObjective 21: Encourage continuous improvement in administrative, \ngovernance, planning, and stewardship systems, procedures, and \npolicies that enable students, faculty, staff, and the institution as a whole \nto achieve shared strategic goals. \nCompliance with Legislation, \nPolicy and/or Procedure \nRelevant to the Proposal \n(please quote legislation and \ninclude identifying section \nnumbers) \n1.
