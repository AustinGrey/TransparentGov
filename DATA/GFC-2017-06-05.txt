She explained that Faculties would need to establish specific evaluation standards. \nMotion: Dew/Bruce \nMotion: THAT General Faculties Council recommends that the Board of Governors approve the proposed \nchanges to the appointment, promotion, salaries, tenure and dismissals elements of the Contract Academic \nStaff: Teaching Agreement, to be known henceforth as the Academic Teaching Staff Agreement, as ratified by \nAASUA membership and as set forth in Attachment 2, to take effect July 1, 2017. \nCARRIED \n6. Report and Recommendations of the ad hoc Committee on Academic Governance Including Delegated \nAuthority  \nMaterials before members are contained in the official meeting file. \nPresenter(s): Mark Loewen; Steve Patten \nPurpose of the Proposal: The approval of these guiding documents will inform future work for the academic \ngoverning body and are critical foundational documents. The Report of the ad hoc Committee on Academic \nGovernance Including Delegated Authority presents recommendations for academic governance reform and \nsets forth a plan for how members can continue the work and be engaged participants in the academic \ngovernance process. \nDiscussion:  \nGFC General Faculties Council 04/21/2017 \nPage 6 \nThe Chair noted that Objective 21 of For the Public Good refers to refreshing and building good governance; \nand that this report represents a transformative process for academic governance at the university that will set a \ntemplate for the evolution of GFC for years to come. The Chair noted that GFC has received regular updates of \nthe work of the ad hoc committee and thanked the members of the ad hoc committee for their work on this \nproject over the last seven months. He reported that more work would be required in the coming months to \nrefine committee terms of reference and to develop and implement strategies recommended in the report. He \nthen invited  the ad hoc Committee Chair, Dr Mark Loewen, and Vice-Chair, Dr Steve Patten, to speak to the \nreport. \nDr Loewen and Dr Pattern provided an overview of the ad hoc committee’s deliberations and the process \ninvolved in arriving at the recommendations presented. They noted that the guiding principles for the ad hoc \ncommittee were approved by GFC in November 2016, that ideas contained in the report were developed and \nrevised over the seven month period, and that the ad hoc committee was driven by what it heard and by the \ndeadlines it operated under.  \nAs a foundational part of its work, the ad hoc committee developed four foundational documents which inform \nthe recommendations, including revisions to standing committee terms of reference, and provide guidlenes to \ndirect the remaining work outlined in the recommendations. These documents also serve as the basis for future \nefforts to evaluate and improve academic governance at the university. Dr Loewen and Dr Patten provided an \noverview of each of these four documents: \n• Principles for Delegation of Authority \n• Principles for Standing Committee Composition \n• Roles and Responsibilities of Members \n• Meeting Procedural Rules \nDuring the discussion of the proposed procedural rules, Dr Patten emphasized that the focus was on a process \nthat would lead to inclusive and respectful dialogue routed in a level of informality that would allow for a degree \nof flexibiity that, with leadership from the Chair, would facilitate rather than impede debate. In discussing \ncommittee composition, members commented on the principle of having greater representation by GFC \nmembers on committees and the implications to individual member workload, and to diverse and broad \nrepresentation on committees. Dr Lowen noted that the principle was developed to provide a closer connection \nbetween GFC and its committees, one of the core issues which had been identified. He also noted that the \nprinciple should be employed whenever possible; and that the ad hoc committee recognized that there could be \nexceptions due to the specific mandate of some committees. \nGFC discussed the addition of ‘research’ to the name of the current GFC Academic Planning Committee (APC) \nand to make its mandate on research policy more explicit. GFC also discussed attendance expectations and \nvideo conferencing, and the reinvigoration of the Council on Student Affairs (COSA).  \nGFC members congratulated and thanked the ad hoc committee for the report and recommendations.  \nThe Chair noted that further work would be required in the coming months by standing committees and other \ngroups, and would also include further consultations on some items. He noted that these items will come before \nGFC for approval in due course. A transition committee, including members of the GFC Executive Committee \nand the ad hoc committee, would oversee this work for completion by April 2019. \nThe Chair thanked members of the ad hoc Committee for their work on this important matter so vital to the \nuniversity. \nMotion I:  Loewen/Berger \nMotion I: THAT General Faculties Council approves the following four key guiding documents as set forth in \nGFC General Faculties Council 04/21/2017 \nPage 7 \nAttachment 1 to take effect upon approval:  \n• GFC Principles for Delegation of Authority  \n• GFC Principles of Standing Committee Composition  \n• GFC Roles and Responsibilities of Members  \n• GFC Meeting Procedural Rules \nCARRIED \nMotion II:  Loewen/Cormack \nMotion II: THAT General Faculties Council endorses and approves in principle the Report of the Ad Hoc \nCommittee on Academic Governance Including Delegated Authority and draft GFC Standing Committee Terms \nof Reference as set forth in Attachment 2. \nCARRIED \nMotion III:  Loewen/Wilson \nMotion III: THAT General Faculties Council endorses the transition process as outlined in the Report of the Ad \nHoc Committee on Academic Governance Including Delegated Authority for implementation of the \nrecommendations on or before April 30, 2019.  \nCARRIED \nMotion IV:  Cooper/Mocquais \nMotion IV: THAT General Faculties Council discharges, with thanks, the Ad Hoc Committee on Academic \nGovernance Including Delegated Authority once the transition committee is established. \nCARRIED \nINFORMATION REPORTS \n7. Report of the GFC Executive Committee  \nMaterials before members are contained in the official meeting file. \n8. Report of the GFC Nominating Committee  \nMaterials before members are contained in the official meeting file. \n9.

Adjournment \nThe Chair adjourned the meeting at 3:00 p.m. \n1 \nOFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT  \n2-24 South Academic Building (SAB)  |  Edmonton, Alberta, Canada T6G 2G7  |  president.ualberta.ca \nPRESIDENT’S  \nREPORT \nTO THE GENERAL FACULTIES COUNCIL  \nAs the 2016-17 academic year draws to a close, I want to thank you for your commitment to \nacademic governance and your dedication to the University of Alberta. To those members who are \nnot returning to GFC, it has been a pleasure working with you this past year. Thank you for your \nservice. \nI have highlighted several recent developments in the following pages. Of particular note: \n• On June 1, the university will sign a historic memorandum of understanding with the National \nCentre for Truth and Reconciliation \n• Reports on both the Peter Lougheed Leadership College and our student residences have been \npublished to guide development and improve the student experience at the U of A  \n• In late March, the Signature Areas Development Panel presented several themes for exploration, \nand published the full list of proposals submitted by our community  \nI wish all of you a restorative summer break, and I look forward to reconvening in the 2017-2018 \nyear to continue our work on academic governance.    \n2 \nOFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT  \n2-24 South Academic Building (SAB)  |  Edmonton, Alberta, Canada T6G 2G7  |  president.ualberta.ca \nNational Centre for Truth And Reconciliation Agreement \nOn June 1, 2017, the University of Alberta will sign a memorandum of understanding with the \nNational Centre for Truth and Reconciliation. The agreement represents an important symbolic \nstep in moving towards reconciliation at the U of A. As a partner to this MOU, we are expected to: \n• Improve access to the centre’s archives, and contribute additional holdings  \n• Facilitate additional oral history and community narratives, research and reports \n• Support a broad scope of public education, research, cultural and reconciliation activities \n• Be inclusive of a wide variety of individuals and groups \n• Help the centre to serve the public in a variety of Indigenous languages, as well as English and \nFrench \n• Fulfill community needs related to residential school research, education and reconciliation  \nWe will undertake this work in consultation and collaboration with our community partners, many \nof whom who will join us for the signing. I encourage everyone to join us in Quad on North Campus \nfor this historic event. \nKEY TALKING POINT:  \nThe University of Alberta is dedicated to building—and supporting—a \ndiverse and inclusive community of students, faculty and staff.   \nAssistant Dean (Diversity): Faculty of Medicine & Dentistry \nThis semester saw the advent of a new leadership position within Medicine & Dentistry: Assistant \nDean of Diversity. Dr. Helly Goez, Department of Pediatrics, has taken on the role for a three year \nterm.  \nIn For the Public Good, we committed to working towards a balanced academy, representative of \nwomen, visible minorities, sexual and gender minorities, Indigenous peoples, and people with \ndisabilities. Faculty leadership positions, such as this one, have a key role to play in building a \ndiverse, inclusive community at the University of Alberta.  \nYou can read more about Dr. Goez and her appointment—as well as her counterpoint in the Faculty \nof Science, Associate Dean (Diversity) Margaret-Ann Armour—on The Quad.  \nhttps://docs.google.com/a/ualberta.ca/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScQ9tqTSizH4uOr1hd4gzGh6j3tuH_WdCLnDOiq1MQX5_boIA/viewform?c=0&w=1\nhttp://blog.ualberta.ca/2017/04/towards-diversity.html\n3 \nOFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT  \n2-24 South Academic Building (SAB)  |  Edmonton, Alberta, Canada T6G 2G7  |  president.ualberta.ca \nResidence Life Task Force Report \nIn For the Public Good, we set a shared goal to create opportunities, spaces and programs that \nensure students fully experience personal and intellectual growth while at the University of \nAlberta. As part of our efforts meet this goal, we invited members of the Students’ Union, Graduate \nStudents’ Association, Provost’s Office, Dean of Students, and Ancillary Services to form the \nResidence Life Task Force.  \nThe task force conducted a comprehensive examination of student and employee life in residence, \nand identified nine actionable recommendations. To ensure that these recommendations are \naddressed, Provost Steven Dew has asked that the first item—the development of a Residence \nOversight Committee (ROC)—be in place by the fall. The ROC will include a mix of university and \nstudent representatives who will engage in regular discussions on matters related to residence \noperations and residence life. The ROC will also review the progress on the report’s other \nrecommendations.  \nKEY TALKING POINT:  \nExperiential learning is critical because students learn in “real time”—\nthey hone skills and reshape knowledge through hands-on experience.  \nIt is where they learn relationship-building, communication, problem-\nsolving and leadership.   \nPeter Lougheed Leadership College Review \nLate last fall, the U of A commissioned a report on the Peter Lougheed Leadership College as part \nof routine review practices. Peter MacKinnon, former president of the University of Saskatchewan, \nconducted an extensive review to assess the PLLC and the progress that has been made since its \ninception.  \nDr. MacKinnon’s report highlighted core strengths of the college, including high-quality \nprogramming and a close alignment with For the Public Good, as well as potential challenges that \nwe will need to address to ensure that the college’s future potential is fully realized. Though the \ncollege is still new, a review now allows us to reflect, course-correct where needed, and fine-tune \nstrategic planning for the future.  \nThe PLLC leadership team will continue to work with deans, college staff, and others to examine in \nmore depth the concerns flagged in the report, and put in place strategies that will continue to \nserve students in the PLLC well. \nhttp://blog.ualberta.ca/2017/05/report-released-on-residence-life-at.html\nhttp://blog.ualberta.ca/2017/05/report-released-on-residence-life-at.html\nhttp://blog.ualberta.ca/2017/05/report-released-on-peter-lougheed.html\n4 \nOFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT  \n2-24 South Academic Building (SAB)  |  Edmonton, Alberta, Canada T6G 2G7  |  president.ualberta.ca \nSignature Areas \nAt a campus form on March 23, Provost Steven Dew, Vice-President (Research) Lorne Babiuk and I \npresented the work that the Signature Areas Development Panel has completed to date. After \nreviewing the individual proposals, the panel began to identify and develop thematic areas. Though \nthese areas will evolve through further consultations, the panel presented the following themes \nfor exploration:  \n• Indigenous Peoples: Sustainable, Community-Based Revitalization  \n• Research at the Intersections of Gender  \n• Environmental Futures: Energy, Resources and Society  \n• Food for Life: Agriculture, Food-Nutrition-Health and Society  \n• Learning from Data: Big Data and its Applications across the Disciplines  \n• Wellness  \n• Nanoscience and Nanotechnology \nAdditionally, we have now published the full list of proposals submitted to the Signature Areas \nDevelopment Panel. \nArtificial Intelligence \nOn March 30, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau reiterated the federal government’s plan to fund a \npan-Canadian AI strategy. The University of Alberta, ranked second in the world in artificial \nintelligence research, will share $125 million in funding with other centres of AI expertise in \nToronto/Waterloo and Montreal to position Canada as a global leader. AI represents a \ntransformative area with enormous potential for growth, and the University of Alberta is taking a \nnational and global leadership position. I wrote a detailed reflection on this opportunity in an op-ed \nfor the Edmonton Journal. \nKEY TALKING POINT:  \nBy 2025, artificial intelligence and machine-learning technologies are \npredicted to generate $50 trillion in global economic growth. Canadian \nresearchers are positioned to lead this social and economic revolution.  \nhttps://www.ualberta.ca/strategic-plan/institutional-priorities/signature-areas-development#Updates\nhttps://www.ualberta.ca/strategic-plan/institutional-priorities/signature-areas-development/proposed-signature-areas\nhttps://www.ualberta.ca/news-and-events/newsarticles/2017/march/ualberta-to-play-prominent-role-in-pan-canadian-ai-strategy\nhttp://edmontonjournal.com/opinion/columnists/opinion-smart-for-edmonton-to-seize-ai-opportunity\nhttp://edmontonjournal.com/opinion/columnists/opinion-smart-for-edmonton-to-seize-ai-opportunity\n5 \nOFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT  \n2-24 South Academic Building (SAB)  |  Edmonton, Alberta, Canada T6G 2G7  |  president.ualberta.ca \nInternational Travel \nNew York  \nIn early May, I travelled to New York City to participate in two events. First, we co-hosted an Alumni \nand Friends event with the Consul General, which included a panel discussion on “Opportunities \nand Challenges in Preparing for Global Careers.” Second, I participated in a Worldwide Universities \nNetwork Presidents Forum on the UN’s sustainable development goals, and the role of universities \nin global development. As part of the forum, I chaired a panel discussion titled, “Universities and \nLeadership in the Global Challenges of the Future.” \nChina – Chancellor Doug Stollery  \nChancellor Doug Stollery recently travelled to China with a Government of Alberta delegation \nheaded by Premier Rachel Notley. During the trip, the U of A signed notable agreements with \nTsinghua University and the Guanghua International Education Association. \nAga Khan Garden \nIn early April, the recently renamed University of Alberta Botanic Garden announced the new Aga \nKhan Garden. The garden symbolizes an ongoing partnership between the University of Alberta and \nthe Aga Khan Development Network—a collaboration that has fostered intellectual, cultural and \neducational exchange for more than a decade. The new garden was made possible by His Highness \nthe Aga Khan with a gift in excess of $25 million. \nCommunity Connections Awards \nOn May 15, we hosted the Community Connections Awards at City Hall. The annual awards \nrecognize those people whose commitment to community engagement embodies the spirit of the U \nof A’s promise of “uplifting the whole people.” This year’s recipients are: \n• Elaine Hyshka – received the Community Scholar Award for her public health work in the area of \nsubstance use \n• University Health Centre Nursing Team – received the Community Leader Award for their critical \nsupport of evacuees during the Fort McMurray fire \n• Shirley Ross – received the Ualberta Advocate Award for her volunteer leadership at the Green \nand Gold Community Garden and her contributions to the Tubahumurize Association \nhttp://botanicgarden.ualberta.ca/About/News/ArticleID/498/Welcome-to-the-UABotanicGarden-Blog\nhttp://botanicgarden.ualberta.ca/Gardens-Collections/Aga-Khan-Garden-Alberta\nhttp://botanicgarden.ualberta.ca/Gardens-Collections/Aga-Khan-Garden-Alberta\nhttps://www.ualberta.ca/university-relations/about-us/community-connections-awards\nhttp://blog.ualberta.ca/2017/05/elaine-hyshka-approaching-substance-use.html\nhttp://blog.ualberta.ca/2017/05/honouring-university-health-centre.html\nhttp://blog.ualberta.ca/2017/05/shirley-ross-2017-ualberta-advocate.html\n6 \nOFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT  \n2-24 South Academic Building (SAB)  |  Edmonton, Alberta, Canada T6G 2G7  |  president.ualberta.ca \nProvincial and Federal Budgets \nThe 2017 budgets, released in March, held positive news for the U of A. Provincially, the \ngovernment honoured its promise of a 2 per cent increase to the Campus Alberta grant. We were \nalso pleased to see capital funding of $149 million over the first four years of the Dentistry \nPharmacy Building refurbishment project, and we are ready to proceed quickly with that initiative.  \nFederally, we saw significant investments in students, sustained commitment to Canada’s granting \ncouncils, and the previously mentioned pan-Canadian AI strategy funding. The federal budget also \nfollowed $2.1M in research infrastructure funding for 14 U of A projects, announced March 2. \nI provided more detailed responses to the provincial and federal budgets on The Quad. \nUAlberta Budget Model  \nThe recent investigation into a responsibility-centred budget model yielded several important \ninsights. A full RCM model is not feasible at the university, so the next step is to take our findings \nand develop a hybrid budget model that suits the needs, challenges, and structure at the U of A. We \nhave begun to engage senior administrators across the university in this important conversation. \nAcademic Governance Report \nSince the Ad Hoc Committee on Academic Governance Including Delegated Authority’s final report \nwas endorsed at the GFC special meeting in April, we have shared the report broadly with the \npublic, and directly with both the Senate and the Board of Governors. \nLeadership Transitions \nWe recently welcomed three new deans on campus: Dr. Greta Cummings has been appointed dean \nof the Faculty of Nursing, Dr. Jennifer Tupper has been appointed dean of the Faculty of Education, \nand Dr. Heather Zwicker has been appointed vice-provost and dean of the Faculty of Graduate \nStudies and Research. \nThank you for your continued dedication to the University of Alberta. \nYours sincerely, \nDavid H.

However, close examination determined all 3 were actually \nUndeclared majors who were reported as Musical Arts majors due to the \nreporting requirements stipulated by the Government of Alberta.  The \nlast reported Musical Arts major was in 2010. \nGiven the lack of registrations in these majors, consultation with the \nOffice of the Provost and Vice President (Academic) and the \nGovernment of Alberta recommended moving forward with the \ntermination of these majors, without a period of suspension. \nItem No. 5 \nGENERAL FACULTIES COUNCIL \nFor the Meeting of June 5, 2017, 2017 \n Engagement and Routing (Include meeting dates) \nParticipation: \n(parties who have seen the \nproposal and in what capacity) \n<For further information see \nthe link posted on the \nGovernance Toolkit section \nStudent Participation Protocol> \nThose who have been informed: \n• Wide ranging discussions in Summer/Fall of 2016 on Augustana \nFaculty within the Music division, Department of Fine Arts and \nHumanities, Augustana Dean’s Office, Augustana Prospective \nStudents Office, Augustana Learning, Advising & Beyond Office, \nAugustana Registrar’s Office. \nThose who have been consulted: \n• Karsten Mündel, Augustana Associate Dean, Academic, \nDecember 11, 2015 \n• Jonathan Hawkins, Assistant Registrar, Augustana Campus, \nNovember 9, 2016 \n• Kate Peters, Office of the Provost Portfolio Initiatives Manager, \nNovember 23, 2016 \n• Department of Fine Arts and Humanities Meeting, January 9. \n2017 \n• Augustana Curriculum Committee Meeting, January 12, 2017 \nThose who are actively participating: \n• Milton Schlosser, Professor of Music and Director of Music, \nAugustana Faculty \n• Augustana Music Division – regular consultation with all Music \ninstructors, staff, and students at Augustana Faculty in Spring, \nSummer, Fall, 2016. \n• Augustana Music Division meeting to propose termination of \nmajors, November 14, 2016 \nApproval Route (Governance) \n(including meeting dates) \nAugustana Faculty Council – February 6, 2017  \nGFC Academic Planning Committee – April 19, 2017  \nGeneral Faculties Council – June 5, 2017 \nBoard Learning and Discovery Committee – September 29, 2017 \nBoard of Governors – October 20, 2017 \nFinal Approver Board of Governors \nAlignment/Compliance \nAlignment with Guiding \nDocuments \nFor the Public Good  \nGOAL: SUSTAIN our people, our work, and the environment by \nattracting and stewarding the resources we need to deliver excellence to \nthe benefit of all.  \nObjective 21: Encourage continuous improvement in administrative, \ngovernance, planning, and stewardship systems, procedures, and \npolicies that enable students, faculty, staff, and the institution as a whole \nto achieve shared strategic goals. \nCompliance with Legislation, \nPolicy and/or Procedure \nRelevant to the Proposal \n(please quote legislation and \ninclude identifying section \nnumbers) \n1.

Rationale for suspension (for example, changes in applications, enrolment, employer \ndemand, program obsolescence, etc.).  Comment on the alignment of the proposed change \nwith the institution’s strategic direction and priorities.  If enrolment is a key rationale, \nprovide historical enrolment data. \n2. Anticipated impacts on students and graduates and plans to ameliorate these impacts.  \nDescribe the institution’s plan to teach out active students and stop-outs.  Include evidence \nof consultation with students and a communications plan for informing stopped-out \nstudents of the change. \n3. Identify anticipated impacts on external stakeholders (e.g. employers, professional/ \nregulatory organizations, other post-secondary institutions) and provide evidence of \nconsultation. \n4. Identify anticipated impacts on institutional operations and resources (e.g. operating \nbudget, staffing, student services, information technology, library, classroom and lab \nspace).

Rationale for reactivation (for example, increased employer demand, student demand, new \nfunding sources, etc.).  Comment on the alignment of the proposed change with the \ninstitution’s strategic direction and priorities. \n2. Identify anticipated impacts on institutional operations and resources (e.g. operating \nbudget, staffing, student services, information technology, library, and classroom and lab \nspace). \n3. Provide a simplified enrolment plan using the following table.  Include assumptions and \nexplanatory notes (e.g., attrition, part-time enrolment). \nProposed Enrolment Year 1 Year 2 Year 3 Year 4 Year 5 Annual Ongoing \nIntake (head count) 0 0 0 0 0 0 \nTotal head count 0 0 0 0 0 0 \nTotal FLE 0 0 0 0 0 0 \nAnticipated No. of Graduates 0 0 0 0 0 0 \nC:  Termination \n1. Describe measures taken by the institution to ensure that active students and stop-outs have \nhad ample opportunity to complete their programs of study. \nNo student has been registered in either the Augustana Bachelor of Music Liturgical Arts \nmajor or Musical Arts major since the University of Alberta began officially maintaining \nthe Augustana Faculty student records in September 2006.   Official student headcounts \nreported to the Government of Alberta by the University indicate no students registered in \nLiturgical Arts since 2006.  Three Musical Arts registrations were reported (1 each in 2006, \n2007, and 2010); however, close examination determined all 3 were actually Undeclared \nstudents who were reported as being Musical Arts majors due to reporting requirements.  \nThe students reported in 2006 and 2007 subsequently graduated from the University of \nAlberta – Augustana Faculty with different BMus majors; the student reported in 2010 \nwithdrew from the program after the Fall 2010 and has not returned to the University. If \nthis student returns, as an Undeclared major, she can still choose between the remaining \nBMus majors offered by Augustana Faculty - Comprehensive, Piano, and Voice - and \nwould not even notice the change in offerings.  As such, there are no active students or \nstop-outs eligible for these majors. \nThe Augustana Fine Arts and Humanities Department has informed the Augustana \nProspective Students Office of the intention to terminate these majors.  Historically, there \nhas been no demand for registration in these programs, but in the highly unlikely event of \nan applicant requesting consideration for either major in the current admission cycle, such \nan applicant would be directed into one of the three remaining BMus majors offered by \nAugustana Faculty – Comprehensive, Piano, or Voice. \n2. Where applicable, summarize the actual re-allocation of resources during the period of \nsuspension, and any additional re-allocation anticipated upon termination, and specify the \nimpacts of re-allocation on institutional operations.   \nUpon recommendation of the Office of the Provost and Vice President (Academic) in \nconsultation with the Government of Alberta, Augustana Faculty proposes to terminate \nboth majors without a period of suspension.  The lack of registration in either major results \nin no resources available for reallocation, but does allow for a clarity of opportunity and \nresourcing for the remaining three majors in the Augustana BMus program. \nAppendix 1: 2018/19 Calendar Changes for Augustana Faculty \nCurrent (2017-18 Calendar Entry Proposed (2018-19) Calendar Entry \nBachelor of Music (BMus) \n[Augustana] \nOverview \nThe Bachelor of Music program consists of \n★122, including ★65 of core music \nrequirements, ★24 in one of the five Bachelor \nof Music majors, and ★33 of non-music \nrequirements. In two of these majors, Liturgical \nArts and Musical Arts, a minor is required; in \nthe other three majors, Piano, Voice, and \nComprehensive, a minor is optional. The minor \nconsists of a minimum of ★18 in one discipline \nor approved interdisciplinary area, including at \nleast ★12 at the senior level. A student should \nbe aware that it may not be possible to complete \ncertain combinations of majors and minors \nwithout extending the time required to earn the \ndegree. \nResidence Requirement \nStudents registered in a BMus program must \ncomplete at least 60 senior credits offered by the \nAugustana Faculty. However, \n1.  Language or other study abroad may, \nwith special permission of the Associate \nDean, Academics, count toward the \nresidence requirement \n2.  An exception to this may be granted to \nstudents already holding a BA or BSc who \ncan transfer sufficient credits from their first \ndegree to be able to complete the \nrequirements of the Bachelor of Music \ndegree in fewer than ★60. Normally in such \ncases at least the final ★45 must be \ncompleted at Augustana. \nGeneral Information \nFive majors are available in the Bachelor of \nMusic degree program: Piano, Voice, \nComprehensive, Liturgical Arts, Musical Arts: \nBachelor of Music (BMus) \n[Augustana] \nOverview \nThe Bachelor of Music program consists of \n★122, including ★65 of core music \nrequirements, ★24 in one of the three Bachelor \nof Music majors, and ★33 of non-music \nrequirements. A minor is optional in all three \nmajors. The minor consists of a minimum of \n★18 in one discipline or approved \ninterdisciplinary area, including at least ★12 at \nthe senior level.

Professional employment \nas, for example, a soloist, chorister, \naccompanist, chamber musician, or teacher, is a \npossibility for a graduate seeking a career as a \nmusic performer. Along with independent \nfreelance career opportunities, a degree with \neither of these majors can also lead to a career as \nprofessor in music performance in a college, \nuniversity, or conservatory. These majors \nrequire high artistic standards, include courses \nspecific to piano and voice in literature and \npedagogy, and provide for a broadly-based \nmusic education with advanced studies in music \ntheory and music history. Four years of \nensembles (choral/instrumental and chamber) \nare required. \nComprehensive \nA student who seeks intensive studies in an \ninstrument or voice, variety in music options, \nand advanced studies in music history, theory, \nand ensembles, should consider this major. It is \nsuitable for the student desiring to prepare for a \ncareer as, for example, a professional wind, \nbrass, or string player, a choral or instrumental \nconductor, an arts administrator, or a \nprofessional librarian. Like the Bachelor of Arts \ndegree in music, this major enables the student \nto enter graduate studies in more specific fields \nsuch as music theory, music history, \nethnomusicology, and popular music studies. If \nthe student enrols in third- and fourth-year \nrecital courses, this degree may facilitate entry \ninto performance-based graduate programs as \nwell. \nLiturgical Arts \nA student considering professional employment \nas a church musician, or considering graduate \nstudies, may designate this major at the end of \nthe second year of full-time studies (or part-time \nequivalent).

It provides for a liberalized \ncurriculum that combines the strong \nperformance emphasis and scholarly breadth of \na Bachelor of Music, the requirements for a \nminor in another discipline, and interdisciplinary \nresearch on the relationships between the two \ndisciplines. This is the most unique and \n“cutting-edge” of the Bachelor of Music majors. \nA student may apply for this major at the end of \ntwo-years - full-time study or part-time \nequivalent. \nAdmission Requirements \nSee Augustana Faculty.

The audit \nbrings a unique opportunity to review and improve upon operating systems for grants \nadministration at our academic institution. \nQ1: Why were the PIs affected not interviewed during the audit process?  \nQ2: What potential integration of the U of A's central HR with RSO operations is going to occur \nas a result of this audit (i.e. how grant-specific hires are done) - to improve efficiency of grants \nadministrations from the PI's perspective? Similarly, what potential integration of the U of A's \ncentral finances with RSO operations is going to occur as a result of this audit? How will this \nresult in better and more coordinated communications with the PI? \nQ3: Based on this audit, it appears that there is no apparently role for a 4 level signature \nprocess for NIH and other grants particularly that require integration of clinical operations (AHS) \nwith our academic institution for subject recruitment through AHS staffing with a research \ncomponent in their job description - which is common in grants held by the Faculty of Medicine \nand Dentistry. Therefore, can the 4 level signature process be reviewed and simplified - as it \ndoes not result in the institutional accountability for grants that are administered within the U of \nA that incorporate recruitment of subjects from clinics? \nGENERAL FACULTIES COUNCIL \nFor the Meeting of June 5, 2017 \nItem 7.1R \nResponse from the Research Services Office to Question 7.1Q \nR1:  The external auditors conduct their audit in accordance with Canadian generally accepted auditing \nstandards.  Those standards require that they plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable \nassurance necessary to render their opinion on the financial statements.  The specific audit procedures, \nwhich were conducted between January 16, 2017 and March 16, 2017, are determined by the auditors \nbased on what they consider necessary to obtain reasonable assurance.   \nR2:  The Research Services Office has worked closely with Human Resources (HR) and Financial Services \nthroughout the development and implementation of the HCM 9.2 upgrade as well as through various \naudit recommendations.  The three units also sit on a number of committees together in which they \nshare information and discuss issues.  Those committees include the following: \n• Information Technology Steering Committee (ITSCA) \n• Finance Management Committee (FMC) \n• University Research Administration Committee (URAC) \nWhen recommendations result from audits or similar reviews, RSO works with faculties and central units \nsuch as HR and Financial Services to determine an appropriate response.   \nWith respect to grant specific hires, HR is in the midst of replacing all Pay Action Forms and Smart Forms \nwith eForms as part of the HCM 9.2 upgrade.  eForms are on-line electronic forms within PeopleSoft \nthat capture employee information and facilitate related approvals. They are an electronic version of the \ncurrent paper forms process used by departments and faculties at the U of A for hiring and/or updating \nemployee records.  eForms is intended to bring efficiency to manual processes in managing employee \nrecords by enabling a streamlined workflow, improve data integrity and audit trail. \nIt is very important that PIs receive information with respect to procedures and policies that are being \ndeveloped or amended.  This is accomplished through the development of an appropriate \ncommunication or change management plan.  When audit recommendations are directed to a particular \nresearch project, we work one-on-one with the researcher and with his or her department.  When the \nrecommendations are directed to the entire campus, a much broader plan is developed.   \nR3:  The institutional requirements for signing grant applications and agreements are based on the \nResearch Administration Roles and Responsibilities Procedure and the Contract Review and Signing \nAuthority Policy in UAPPOL.  The RSO undertook an extensive consultation process in 2015/16 to update \nthe Research Administration Roles and Responsibilities Procedure which is what provides the UofA’s \nhttps://policiesonline.ualberta.ca/PoliciesProcedures/Procedures/Research-Administration-Roles-and-Responsibilities-Procedure.pdf\nhttps://policiesonline.ualberta.ca/PoliciesProcedures/Policies/Contract-Review-and-Signing-Authority-Policy.pdf\nhttps://policiesonline.ualberta.ca/PoliciesProcedures/Policies/Contract-Review-and-Signing-Authority-Policy.pdf\nrequirements for signatures on grant applications.  UAPPOL policies and procedures can be amended \nwhen necessary subject to the requirements of the Policy Development Toolkit.   \nIt should also be noted that the U of A is planning to implement on-line authorizations for grant \napplications this year which should make the approval process much more efficient than the current \nprocess of gathering signatures.  Preliminary consultations are underway for this project, with more \nextensive consultations taking place when the project begins.  More information on the anticipated \nkickoff date for the project and go-live will be provided as soon as it is available. \nGENERAL FACULTIES COUNCIL \nFor the Meeting of June 5, 2017 \nItem 7.2Q \nQuestion from GFC Member Jorge Sousa (submitted by email May 24, 2017) \nQuestion 7.2Q \nDear Dr. Turpin, \nI am writing this message on behalf of my department, Educational Policy Studies, and as a \nconcerned member of GFC. Over the past two years there have been at least two known racist \nincidents that have targeted members of my department. While these types of incidents are \narguably not unique to my department, and unfortunately has occurred at different places on \ncampus, concern has been expressed over a perceived lack of a public response from the \nUniversity administration regarding these incidents. To that end, I am requesting a response to \nthe following motion passed at my department council on April 21st, 2017: \nMoved that: Educational Policy Studies are seeking a University Administration response that \naddresses and acknowledges the selective recognition and action of heightened threats to our \ncommunity, particularly towards Indigenous women. \nMy question is: will the president make a public statement reaffirming that the University does \nnot condone these and all racist acts targeting the University community? If so, when will such a \nstatement be made? \nI am well aware of the fulsome and terrific support that has been provided to those affected by \nthese incidents, and I extend a personal thanks to all those involved. Moreover, I realize that all \nresponses need to be considered on its efficacious merit so that they do not have an undesired \noutcome, and the timing of such a statement needs to be considered as well. However, a strong \npublic statement will serve to eliminate the normalization of such incidents, and will go a long \nway to instil a sense of trust within my department and no doubt across the faculties that the \nUniversity does not condone such destructive actions. \nI look forward to your response. Please contact me if you require any information. \n\tItem-1-Agenda\n\tItem-2-Minutes-April-21-2017\n\tItem-3-Report-from-the-President\n\tItem-4-Listing-of-Names-June-5\n\tItem-5-Termination-of-Music-Majors-Augustana-FINAL\n\tItem-5-Termination-of-Music-Majors-Augustana-OI\n\tItem-5-Termination-of-Music-Majors-Augustana-ATT1\n\tProposal Template: Program Suspension, Reactivation and Termination\n\tThis template is for the presentation of proposals for suspension or termination of an existing program or specialization within an existing program; and for reactivation of a suspended program or specialization.\n\tBasic Information\n\tA:  Suspension\n\tItem-8-Exec-Report-to-GFC\n\tItem-9-APC-Report-to-GFC\n\tItem-10-ASC-Report-to-GFC\n\tItem-11-NC-Committee-Appointments-Students\n\tItem-12-CLE Report to GFC\n\tItem-13-Board-Reports-to-GFC\n\tMarch-17-2017\n\tMay-12-2017\n\tItem-15-GFC-template-Chrono\n\tItem-71Q-Question-to-VP-Research-NIH-Audit\n\tItem-71R-Response-from-VP-Research-NIH-Audit\n\tItem-72Q-Question-to-President-Racist-Incidents-Education\n",
