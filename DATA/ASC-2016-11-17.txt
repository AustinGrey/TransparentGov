            "Description": "Purpose of the Proposal: To amend the current MD Program Academic Admission Requirements from students being encouraged to obtain a baccalaureate degree prior to admission, to applicants being required to do so. Discussion: Dr Brenneis reported that there have been a number of changes to the admission criteria for the MD program including the removal of prerequisites aimed to broaden the educational diversity of the applicant pool. The committee discussed whether the requirement for a degree distinguished between a three or a four year degree and it was noted that three year degrees such as in accelerated Nursing programs are quite rigorous. The proponents noted the value of applicants demonstrating commitment to completing a degree. A member reported that the Medical Students' Association (MSA) opposed this proposal, citing decreased access, an increased financial burden for students, that the University would miss out on exceptional students, and lack of a clear rationale for the proposal. Dr Gourishankar responded that she had not seen the letter from the MSA, but that students had participated as part of the MD admissions working group and that she had also met with the Medical Students’ Association and other students as part of ongoing discussions. Dr Brenneis noted that there had been discussion about whether exceptional students would go elsewhere if they were required to have a degree; he noted that this group represents a small number of applicants and the faculty felt that the other benefits of the proposal outweighed this. Dr Gourishankar noted that 77 percent of the last class admitted hold a Bachelor degree, while 89 percent have 4+ years of university education. A member noted that some students enrolled in graduate programs apply to the MD program and asked whether their admission could be deferred to allow them to complete their graduate program; Dr Gourishankar confirmed that deferrals were allowed in such circumstances. Members expressed support for the proposal and the access for a diverse group of applicants. Two minor changes were suggested to the wording of the Calendar copy.",

ASC acts for GFC in approving routine and/or editorial changes to \nboth admission/transfer policies and academic standing regulations” \n3. UAPPOL Admissions Policy: “Admission to the University of Alberta \nis based on documented academic criteria established by individual \nFaculties and approved by GFC. This criteria may be defined in areas \nsuch as subject requirements, minimum entrance averages, and \nlanguage proficiency requirements. In addition to academic requirements \nfor admission, GFC authorizes each Faculty to establish such other \nreasonable criteria for admission of applicants as the Faculty may \nconsider appropriate to its programs of study, subject to the approval of \nGFC (e.g. interview, audition, portfolio, etc.) \nThe admission requirements for any Faculty will be those approved by \nGFC as set forth in the current edition of the University Calendar. In \naddition to the admission requirements, selection criteria for quota \nASC - Nov 17, 2016 - Item 4 - page 3\nItem No. 4A - E \nGFC ACADEMIC STANDARDS COMMITTEE \nFor the Meeting of November 17, 2016 \nprograms, where they exist, will also be published in the current edition \nof the University Calendar. \nThe responsibility for admission decisions will be vested in the Faculty \nAdmission Committees or in the Deans of the respective Faculties, as \nthe councils of such Faculties will determine.” \n4.  UAPPOL Admissions Procedure: \n“PROCEDURE \n1. EFFECTIVE DATE OF CHANGES TO ADMISSION REGULATIONS \nFollowing approval by GFC: \na. Where changes to admission regulations may disadvantage students \nin the current admission cycle, normally implementation will be effective \nafter the change has been published in the University Calendar for one \nfull year (i.e., effective the second year that the information is published \nin the University Calendar). \nFor example, a change approved in May 2005 would be first published in \nthe 2006-2007 University Calendar in March 2006. Therefore the \nstatement cannot come into effect until September 2007 (affecting \napplicants who apply for the September 2007 term beginning July \n2006).” \nb. Where changes to admission regulations are deemed by the \napproving body to be ‘advantageous to students’, normally the date of \nimplementation will be effective immediately or at the next available \nintake for the admitting Faculty.” \n5.  PSLA: The PSLA gives Faculty Councils the authority to “determine \nthe conditions under which a student must withdraw from or may \ncontinue the student’s program of studies in a faculty” (Section 29(1)(d)). \n6. UAPPOL Academic Standing Policy:  “All current academic \nstanding regulations, including academic standing categories, University \ngraduating standards and requirements for all individual programs will be \nthose prescribed by Faculty Councils and GFC as set forth in the \nUniversity Calendar.” \n7. UAPPOL Academic Standing Regulations Procedures: “All \nproposed new academic standing regulations and changes to existing \nacademic standing regulations will be submitted by the Faculties or the \nAdministration to the Provost and Vice-President (Academic). Faculties \nwill also submit to the Provost and Vice-President (Academic) any \nproposed changes to the use and/or computation of averages relating to \nacademic standing, including promotion and graduation. \nIf the Provost and Vice-President (Academic) determines the proposal to \nbe in good order, the proposal will be introduced to the appropriate \nUniversity governance process(es). In considering these proposals, \ngovernance bodies will consult as necessary with the Faculties and with \nother individuals and offices. \nASC - Nov 17, 2016 - Item 4 - page 4\nItem No. 4A - E \nGFC ACADEMIC STANDARDS COMMITTEE \nFor the Meeting of November 17, 2016 \nNormally, changes become effective once they are approved by GFC or \nits delegate and are published in the University Calendar.” \nAttachments  \n1.

The University recognizes, however, \nthat it is not possible to completely eliminate the risk of \ninfection (see University Bloodborne Pathogens Policy). \nThe Faculty of Agricultural, Life and Environmental \nSciences in accordance with the University of Alberta \npolicies and other available guidelines, has developed \nthe following policies concerning bloodborne pathogens. \nThese policies are to be reviewed and adapted, as further \ninformation on bloodborne pathogens becomes \navailable. \nFor students in the BSc Nutrition and Food Science \nprogram who are accepted into the Integrated Dietetic \nInternship, immunization prior to the first internship \nplacement is required. However, for project assistants in \nthe biological sciences areas, Hepatitis B surface antigen \ntesting will be performed by the University Health \nCentre. For those students who test negative for the \nHepatitis B surface antigen (HbsAg), Hepatitis B \nvaccination will be required. Contact Student Services \n(231 General Services Building) for details about testing \nand immunization. \nProgram restrictions will be applied when necessary to \nminimize the risk of transmission of bloodborne \npathogens from students to other students, experimental \nsubjects and service clients. Program restrictions, in \nkeeping with reasonable accommodation guidelines, can \nbe expected in cases where students test positive for any \nbloodborne pathogen, or refuse to complete the \nscreening questionnaire, or refuse a questionnaire-based \nrequirement for Hepatitis B testing. Program restrictions \nmay include prohibition from participating in certain \nactivities and procedures performed as part of research, \nservice testing or teaching function. \nSince the risk of HIV transmission from students to other \nstudents, service clients and experimental subjects is \nvery low for the procedures followed in these settings, \nHIV risk assessment and testing will not be made a \nrequirement at this time. However, all students accepted \ninto the Faculty of Agricultural, Life and Environmental \nUndergraduate Program Infectious Diseases \nRegulation \nSee University Infectious Diseases Regulation \nASC - Nov 17, 2016 - Item 5 - page 22\nhttp://calendar.ualberta.ca/content.php?catoid=6&navoid=803#University_Bloodborne_Pathogens_Policy\nhttp://calendar.ualberta.ca/content.php?catoid=6&navoid=803#University_Bloodborne_Pathogens_Policy\nSciences are encouraged to undergo HIV testing \nwhenever concerns about infection arise. \nNote: For updates on changes to medical testing and \nimmunization refer to the Faculty Office. \nBSc Nutrition and Food Science, Dietetics \nSpecialization [ALES] \n[…] \nProfessional Practice Requirements \nNote: For updates on changes to health and safety \nrequirements refer to the Faculty of Agricultural, Life \nand Environmental Sciences website at: \nwww.ales.ualberta.ca \na.

In addition, students \nmust have their immunization status reviewed \nby the University Health Centre upon \nacceptance to the BSc in Nutrition and Food \nScience, Dietetics Specialization. \nImmunizations may require updating based on \nindividual assessment. Any fees associated with \nimmunization updates or boosters are the \nresponsibility of the student. \nb.

The remaining approvals (GFC, GFC Executive, and BOG) are scheduled in \nSeptember and October.  At the September meeting of the GFC Executive Committee, the University \npolicy was renamed to University Infectious Diseases Regulation. \nFaculty specific changes are required for the November 2016 ASC SOS and ASC meetings.   \nNotes: For the 2017-18 Calendar \nFaculty \nApproval: \nFaculty Council \n      Date:           January 21, 2016  and September 30, 2016 (additional changes \ndeemed editorial by Dean and AD Undergraduate Programs)                      \nto minimize the risk of transmission of \nbloodborne pathogens from students to \nother students, experimental subjects and \nservice clients. Program restrictions, in \nkeeping with reasonable accommodation \nguidelines, can be expected in cases \nwhere students test positive for any \nbloodborne pathogen, or refuse to \ncomplete the screening questionnaire, or \nrefuse a questionnaire based requirement \nfor Hepatitis B testing. Program restrictions \nmay include prohibition from participating \nin certain activities and procedures \nperformed as part of a research, service \ntesting or teaching function. \nSince the risk of HIV transmission from \nstudents to other students, service clients \nand experimental subjects is very low for \nthe procedures followed in these settings, \nHIV risk assessment and testing will not be \nmade a requirement at this time. However, \nall students accepted into the Faculty of \nPhysical Education and Recreation are \nencouraged to undergo HIV testing \nwhenever concerns about infection arise. \nNote: For updates on changes to medical \ntesting and immunization refer to the \nFaculty Office. \nASC - Nov 17, 2016 - Item 5 - page 34\nFaculty of Rehabilitation Medicine Proposed Calendar Changes: \nCurrent Proposed \nPracticum Intervention Policy \nThe Dean, or supervisor acting on behalf of the Dean, \nmay immediately deny assignment of a student to, \nwithdraw a student from, or vary terms, conditions, or \nsite of practicum/clinical placement if the Dean or \nsupervisor has reasonable grounds to believe that this is \nnecessary in order to protect the public interest.

The Police \nInformation Check must be dated no earlier \nthan 90 days prior to the date of collection as \ndesignated by each Department. \nThe ultimate responsibility for ensuring that a \nstudent meets the requirements of clinical \nagencies/practice sites lies with that student. A \nstudent for whom a Police Information Check \nreveals a criminal record may be unable to \ncomplete the required clinical placements and \nmay be required to withdraw from their \nprogram. The clinical agency/practice site will \ndetermine the criteria for acceptance/denial of a \nplacement if the Police Information Check \nreveals a criminal record. A student who has \nconcerns related to the possibility that a Police \nInformation Check might reveal a criminal \nrecord should consult with the Faculty of the \nDepartment in which they are enrolled. \n5. Immunization Requirements and \nBloodborne Pathogens Policy: Rehabilitation \nMedicine students are health care professionals \nwho will be exposed to patients during the \ncourse of studies at the University. To ensure, \ninsofar as possible, both student and patient \nsafety, the Faculty requires immunization, or \nproof of immunity, to poliomyelitis, diphtheria, \ntetanus, measles, mumps, rubella and hepatitis \nB. As well, varicella titre and TB testing are \nrequired. A two-step tuberculin skin test is \nrequired in the first year of the program and \nshould be performed by the University of \nAlberta Health Centre. \nThe University of Alberta recognizes its duty to \nminimize the risk of transmission of bloodborne \npathogens to/by individuals studying or \nworking at this University. The Bloodborne \nPathogens Policy limits the possibility of \nbloodborne pathogens within the educational \nsetting. The University recognizes, however, \nthat it is not possible to completely eliminate \nthe risk of infection. Refer to University \nBloodborne Pathogens Policy, for additional \ninformation. \nThe Faculty of Rehabilitation Medicine, in \naccordance with University policies and other \navailable guidelines, has developed the \nEach Department will collect Police \nInformation Checks at a time designated by that \nDepartment.

These policies will be reviewed and \nadapted as further information becomes \navailable. \nHepatitis B: Hepatitis B surface antigen testing \nwill be performed by the University of Alberta \nHealth Centre. For those students who test \nnegative for hepatitis B surface antigen \n(HBsAG), hepatitis B vaccination will be \nrequired. An exception will be made for those \nindividuals who have proof of prior vaccination \nand test positive for antibody to hepatitis B \nsurface antigen (antiHBs). After vaccination, \nstudents will receive a second test to determine \nif they have converted to produce the \nappropriate antibody titre. If they have not \nconverted they will receive a second \nvaccination and again be tested. Those students \nwho then fail to convert will be counselled as to \ntheir potential risk status during training and \nfuture practice. \nFor those students who test positive for HbsAG, \ntheir \"e\" antigen (HBeAG) status and the \npresence of hepatitis B viral DNA will be \ndetermined. If they are found to be positive for \nthe \"e\" antigen or the viral DNA they will be \ncounselled as to their risk of infecting patients. \nHuman Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV): The \ndata relating to transmission of HIV from a \nhealth care worker to a patient in a health care \nsetting are limited. Transmission from patients \nto a health care worker is more common. All \nstudents accepted into the Faculty are \nencouraged to undergo HIV testing at any time \nduring their program when concerns about \ninfection have arisen. Testing for HIV is not \nmandatory. \nImmunization/bloodborne pathogen \nrequirements must be fulfilled by the date \npublished in the fieldwork/clinical placement \nprocedures manual. Students must sign a waiver \nif they are unable to meet these requirements \ndue to medical contraindication. \nNote: For updates on changes to medical testing \nand immunization refer to the Faculty Office. \n6.

An exception is made for those \nindividuals who have proof of prior vaccination \nand test positive for anti-body to hepatitis B surface \nantigen (anti-HBs). After vaccination, students \nreceive a second test to determine if they have \nconverted to produce the appropriate antibody titre. \nIf they have not converted, they receive a second \nvaccination and again are tested. Those students \nwho then fail to convert are counselled as to their \npotential risk status during training and future \npractice. \nFor those students who test positive for HBsAG, \ntheir \"e\" antigen (HBeAG) status and the presence \nof hepatitis B viral DNA is determined. If they are \nfound to be positive for the \"e\" antigen or the viral \nDNA they are counselled as to their risk of \ninfecting patients. \nHepatitis C: \nHepatitis C antibody testing is performed by the \nUniversity of Alberta Health Centre.

The University recognizes, however, \nthat it is not possible to completely eliminate the risk of \ninfection (see University Bloodborne Pathogens Policy). \nThe Faculty of Agricultural, Life and Environmental \nSciences in accordance with the University of Alberta \npolicies and other available guidelines, has developed \nthe following policies concerning bloodborne pathogens. \nThese policies are to be reviewed and adapted, as further \ninformation on bloodborne pathogens becomes \navailable. \nFor students in the BSc Nutrition and Food Science \nprogram who are accepted into the Integrated Dietetic \nInternship, immunization prior to the first internship \nplacement is required. However, for project assistants in \nthe biological sciences areas, Hepatitis B surface antigen \ntesting will be performed by the University Health \nCentre. For those students who test negative for the \nHepatitis B surface antigen (HbsAg), Hepatitis B \nvaccination will be required. Contact Student Services \n(231 General Services Building) for details about testing \nand immunization. \nProgram restrictions will be applied when necessary to \nminimize the risk of transmission of bloodborne \npathogens from students to other students, experimental \nsubjects and service clients. Program restrictions, in \nkeeping with reasonable accommodation guidelines, can \nbe expected in cases where students test positive for any \nbloodborne pathogen, or refuse to complete the \nscreening questionnaire, or refuse a questionnaire-based \nrequirement for Hepatitis B testing. Program restrictions \nmay include prohibition from participating in certain \nactivities and procedures performed as part of research, \nservice testing or teaching function. \nSince the risk of HIV transmission from students to other \nstudents, service clients and experimental subjects is \nvery low for the procedures followed in these settings, \nHIV risk assessment and testing will not be made a \nrequirement at this time. However, all students accepted \ninto the Faculty of Agricultural, Life and Environmental \nUndergraduate Program Infectious Diseases \nRegulation \nSee University Infectious Diseases Regulation \nASC - Nov 17, 2016 - Item 5 - page 22\nhttp://calendar.ualberta.ca/content.php?catoid=6&navoid=803#University_Bloodborne_Pathogens_Policy\nhttp://calendar.ualberta.ca/content.php?catoid=6&navoid=803#University_Bloodborne_Pathogens_Policy\nSciences are encouraged to undergo HIV testing \nwhenever concerns about infection arise. \nNote: For updates on changes to medical testing and \nimmunization refer to the Faculty Office. \nBSc Nutrition and Food Science, Dietetics \nSpecialization [ALES] \n[…] \nProfessional Practice Requirements \nNote: For updates on changes to health and safety \nrequirements refer to the Faculty of Agricultural, Life \nand Environmental Sciences website at: \nwww.ales.ualberta.ca \na.

The GFC Bloodborne Pathogens Policy \n§108.12 limits the possibility of transmission of \nbloodborne pathogens within the educational setting. \nThe University recognizes, however, that it is not \npossible to completely eliminate the risk of infection. \nThe Faculty, in accordance with University policies \nand other current guidelines, has developed the \nfollowing recommendations concerning bloodborne \npathogens. These recommendations will be reviewed \nand adapted as further information on bloodborne \npathogens becomes available. \nAny exposure to human blood/body fluids shall be \nreported immediately according to the University of \nAlberta protocols. Refer to the Faculty Office for \nguidance. \nHepatitis B Virus (HBV): Current information \nindicates that there is a potential risk of transmission \nof hepatitis B from practitioner to patients in the \nclinical experience in practice settings. Therefore, \napplicants will be required to be tested for hepatitis \nB surface antigen by a personal physician or a \nphysician at University Health Centre. Applicants \nwho test positive for hepatitis B surface antigen will \nbe further tested to help determine infectivity risk. \nApplicants who test positive for the antibody to \nhepatitis B surface antigen shall not require hepatitis \nB surface antigen testing. \nFor those applicants who test negative to hepatitis B \nsurface antigen and are registered in the Pharmacy \nprogram, hepatitis B vaccination will be required. \nAn exception will be made for those who have \nmedical contraindications or for those who already \nhave proof of hepatitis B immunity. After \nvaccination, students will be tested to determine if \nthey have developed immunity. If they have not, \nfurther hepatitis B vaccination and counselling will \nbe determined by the University Health Centre. \nAt all times students will follow Universal \nPrecautions when there is a potential of exposure to \nhuman blood or body fluids. \nImmunization requirements must be fulfilled by \nSeptember 30 in the first year of the program. \nStudents must sign a waiver if they are unable to \nmeet immunization requirements due to medical \ncontraindications. \nHuman Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) and \nhepatitis C Virus (HCV): Current evidence-based \nASC - Nov 17, 2016 - Item 5 - page 30\nRationale:    \nThis change was first approved on January 15, 2016.

Rationale for suspension (for example, changes in applications, enrolment, employer \ndemand, program obsolescence, etc.).  Comment on the alignment of the proposed change \nwith the institution’s strategic direction and priorities.  If enrolment is a key rationale, \nprovide historical enrolment data. \nThe rationale for suspending the MA degree program in Comparative Literature is that is has \nbeen rendered superfluous as a free standing program by a series of administrative changes that \nmoved the program content under the auspices of the department of Modern Languages and \nCultural Studies (MLCS). Students wanting to pursue their studies in Comparative Literature \nwill now do so by obtaining an MA degree in Modern Languages and Cultural Studies with a \nsecond-level specialization in Transnational and Comparative Literatures. The move to \nincorporate the field of Comparative Literature into the MLCS program provides many benefits \nto students that aligns with the institution’s strategic plan objective (5) “Build and strengthen \ntrust, connection, and a sense of belonging among all members of the university community \nthrough a focus on shared values”.  \nThe merge of Comparative Literature students with existing students in Modern Languages and \nCultural Studies has been transformative for the student cohort. All graduate students in \nComparative Literature have benefitted from more robust and targeted advising, mentoring, and \nadministrative support provided in Modern Languages and Cultural Studies than they had prior \nto the move into the department. They have also benefitted from broader course offerings in \nModern Languages and Cultural Studies, more interaction with graduate students in other \nsecond-level specializations in the department, increased professional development opportunities \n(grant writing workshops, job market workshops, pedagogy training internal to the department), \nand a wider range of teaching opportunities.  \nThe proposed suspension and ultimate termination of the free standing MA program in \nComparative Literature is now a necessary administrative step. The rationale for the suspension \nof Comparative Literature is administrative.  \nASC - Nov 17, 2016 - Item 6 - page 4\nThe events leading up to the request to suspend Comparative Literature are summarized as \nfollows: \na. The Comparative Literature MA program was administered by the Office of \nInterdisciplinary Studies up until 2014 when they were moved by the Faculty of Arts to \nthe Department of Modern Languages and Cultural Studies.  \nb. In light of this administrative move, the relationship between the specialization in \nModern Languages and Cultural Studies and the Comparative Literature specialization \nwas assessed and it was decided that Comparative Literature would be made a second-\nlevel specialization under the sole primary specialization Modern Languages and Cultural \nStudies. Further, the department could better integrate programming and students \nlogically into its structures without negatively impacting the already existing second-level \nspecializations or placing undue burden on departmental resources (teaching and \nadministrative).  A key benefit to Comparative Literature students of the move to MLCS \nwas the total integration into a departmental structure that could best occur if \nComparative Literature would become a second-level specialization on equal footing \nwith existing second-level specializations.  \nc. The changes required to create the second-level specialization were approved through \ngovernance processes within the Faculty of Arts and the Faculty of Graduate Studies. The \nchanges were undertaken with approval from then Dean of the Faculty of Graduate \nStudies and Research Mazi Shirvani and then Vice-Dean of the Faculty of Arts Heather \nZwicker. This was effective January 1, 2014. \nd. In 2015 MLCS examined all of its second level specializations and proposed merging \nseveral, in order to create the new second level specialization of Transnational and \nComparative Literatures.  The name change was approved at departmental and faculty \n(Arts and the Faculty of Graduate Studies and Research) levels, effective September \n2015. \n2. Anticipated impacts on students and graduates and plans to ameliorate these impacts.  \nDescribe the institution’s plan to teach out active students and stop-outs.  Include evidence \nof consultation with students and a communications plan for informing stopped-out \nstudents of the change. \nThe impact on students is minimal due to the move of Comparative Literature to a secondary \nspecialization within Modern Languages and Cultural Studies. Existing graduate students in \nComparative Literature were carefully advised of their options and supported through regular \ntown halls with the Associate Chair of Graduate Studies for the department. Active students in \nthe program had the option to remain within the “Comparative Literature” program as a primary \nspecialization and be grandparented out; all others will follow the requirements of the \nComparative Literature second-level specialization. Several students have chosen the former, \nthus  we will not be able to terminate the program for another 5 years. \n3. Identify anticipated impacts on external stakeholders (e.g. employers, professional/ \nregulatory organizations, other post-secondary institutions) and provide evidence of \nconsultation. \nASC - Nov 17, 2016 - Item 6 - page 5\nThere is no anticipated impact on external stakeholders; external stakeholders will continue to \nrecognize the degree as stated on the parchment: Master of Arts in Modern Languages and \nCultural Studies with a specialization in Transnational and Comparative Literatures. \n4. Identify anticipated impacts on institutional operations and resources (e.g. operating \nbudget, staffing, student services, information technology, library, classroom and lab \nspace).  Discuss plans for the reallocation of any resources freed up by the proposed \nsuspension.   \nThe move of Comparative Literature to Modern Languages and Cultural Studies as a secondary \nspecialization has a positive impact on institutional operations and resources. The administrative \ndecision to place Comparative Literature within Modern Languages and Cultural Studies allowed \nfor a streamlining of resources allocated toward staff and better oversight of graduate student \nfunding. Any resources freed up were used to effectively deal with cuts to the budget of the \nFaculty of Arts. The integration of Comparative Literature as a second-level specialization \nTransnational and Comparative Literatures (and not as a first-level specialization) allowed the \nDepartment of Modern Languages and Cultural Studies to better address the increased demands \non scarce departmental resources that the move produced (particularly administrative concerns \naround student office space, TA/RAships, research travel funding).  \nB:  Reactivation \n1. Rationale for reactivation (for example, increased employer demand, student demand, new \nfunding sources, etc.).  Comment on the alignment of the proposed change with the \ninstitution’s strategic direction and priorities. \n2. Identify anticipated impacts on institutional operations and resources (e.g. operating \nbudget, staffing, student services, information technology, library, and classroom and lab \nspace). \n3. Provide a simplified enrolment plan using the following table.

All graduate students in \nComparative Literature have benefitted from more robust and targeted advising, mentoring, and \nadministrative support provided in Modern Languages and Cultural Studies than they had prior \nto the move into the department. They have also benefitted from broader course offerings in \nModern Languages and Cultural Studies, more interaction with graduate students in other \nsecond-level specializations in the department, increased professional development opportunities \n(grant writing workshops, job market workshops, pedagogy training internal to the department), \nand a wider range of teaching opportunities.  \nASC - Nov 17, 2016 - Item 6 - page 8\nThe proposed suspension and ultimate termination of the free standing PhD program in \nComparative Literature is now a necessary administrative step. The rationale for the suspension \nof Comparative Literature is administrative.  \nThe events leading up to the request to suspend Comparative Literature are summarized as \nfollows: \na. The Comparative Literature PhD program was administered by the Office of \nInterdisciplinary Studies up until 2014 when they were moved by the Faculty of Arts to \nthe Department of Modern Languages and Cultural Studies.  \nb. In light of this administrative move, the relationship between the specialization in \nModern Languages and Cultural Studies and the Comparative Literature specialization \nwas assessed and it was decided that Comparative Literature would be made a second-\nlevel specialization under the sole primary specialization Modern Languages and Cultural \nStudies. Further, the department could better integrate programming and students \nlogically into its structures without negatively impacting the already existing second-level \nspecializations or placing undue burden on departmental resources (teaching and \nadministrative).  A key benefit to Comparative Literature students of the move to MLCS \nwas the total integration into a departmental structure that could best occur if \nComparative Literature would become a second-level specialization on equal footing \nwith existing second-level specializations.  \nc. The changes required to create the second-level specialization were approved through \ngovernance processes within the Faculty of Arts and the Faculty of Graduate Studies. The \nchanges were undertaken with approval from then Dean of the Faculty of Graduate \nStudies and Research Mazi Shirvani and then Vice-Dean of the Faculty of Arts Heather \nZwicker. This was effective January 1, 2014. \nd. In 2015 MLCS examined all of its second level specializations and proposed merging \nseveral, in order to create the new second level specialization of Transnational and \nComparative Literatures.  The name change was approved at departmental and faculty \n(Arts and the Faculty of Graduate Studies and Research) levels, effective September \n2015. \n2. Anticipated impacts on students and graduates and plans to ameliorate these impacts.  \nDescribe the institution’s plan to teach out active students and stop-outs.  Include evidence \nof consultation with students and a communications plan for informing stopped-out \nstudents of the change. \nThe impact on students is minimal due to the move of Comparative Literature to a secondary \nspecialization within Modern Languages and Cultural Studies. Existing graduate students in \nComparative Literature were carefully advised of their options and supported through regular \ntown halls with the Associate Chair of Graduate Studies for the department. Active students in \nthe program had the option to remain within the “Comparative Literature” program as a primary \nspecialization and be grandparented out; all others will follow the requirements of the \nComparative Literature second-level specialization. Several students have chosen the former, \nthus  we will not be able to terminate the program for another 5 years. \nASC - Nov 17, 2016 - Item 6 - page 9\n3. Identify anticipated impacts on external stakeholders (e.g. employers, professional/ \nregulatory organizations, other post-secondary institutions) and provide evidence of \nconsultation. \nThere is no anticipated impact on external stakeholders; external stakeholders will continue to \nrecognize the degree as stated on the parchment: Master of Arts in Modern Languages and \nCultural Studies with a specialization in Transnational and Comparative Literatures. \n4. Identify anticipated impacts on institutional operations and resources (e.g. operating \nbudget, staffing, student services, information technology, library, classroom and lab \nspace).  Discuss plans for the reallocation of any resources freed up by the proposed \nsuspension.   \nThe move of Comparative Literature to Modern Languages and Cultural Studies as a secondary \nspecialization has a positive impact on institutional operations and resources. The administrative \ndecision to place Comparative Literature within Modern Languages and Cultural Studies allowed \nfor a streamlining of resources allocated toward staff and better oversight of graduate student \nfunding. Any resources freed up were used to effectively deal with cuts to the budget of the \nFaculty of Arts. The integration of Comparative Literature as a second-level specialization \nTransnational and Comparative Literatures (and not as a first-level specialization) allowed the \nDepartment of Modern Languages and Cultural Studies to better address the increased demands \non scarce departmental resources that the move produced (particularly administrative concerns \naround student office space, TA/RAships, research travel funding).  \nB:  Reactivation \n1. Rationale for reactivation (for example, increased employer demand, student demand, new \nfunding sources, etc.).  Comment on the alignment of the proposed change with the \ninstitution’s strategic direction and priorities. \n2. Identify anticipated impacts on institutional operations and resources (e.g. operating \nbudget, staffing, student services, information technology, library, and classroom and lab \nspace). \n3. Provide a simplified enrolment plan using the following table.

EGA: with the addition of courses from available minors, the \ncalculation of EGA was changed to exclude courses that were not \nmandated as part of an engineering program. This is proposed to \nensure that additional courses (such as those from minors) did not \nfavorably or unfavorably affect graduating average.  This further \nensures fairness between students taking minors or not, as well as \nstudents taking approved extra to degree courses. This is in line with \nthe traditional definition of EGA and is critical as part of engineering \nprogram accreditation. \n2. Distinction: The proposed change in the definition of Distinction is in \nresponse again to the new proposed minors. However, the new \ndefinition is more inclusive than the previous definition. The members \nFaculty of Engineering’s APC and ECC believe that any student that \ngraduates with an EGA of 3.5 or above is meritorious of the awarding \nof distinction. \nThe Impact of the Proposal is 1. Maintain the traditional calculation of EGA in response to the new \nprogram options available to engineering students and ensure \naccreditation. \n2. Ensure that all meritorious students, with EGA of 3.5 or above are \nawarded distinction. There have been cases where students with \nsuch EGAs did not receive Distinction because of “lighter loads”; the \nnew calculation of EGA ensures a fairer assessment of students. \nReplaces/Revises (eg, policies, \nresolutions) \nCurrent section of Engineering Regulations in the University Calendar \nTimeline/Implementation Date Fall 2017 \nEstimated Cost and funding \nsource \nN/A \nASC - Nov 17, 2016 - page 1\nItem No. 9 \nGFC ACADEMIC STANDARDS COMMITTEE \nFor the Meeting of November 17, 2016 \nNext Steps (ie.: \nCommunications Plan, \nImplementation plans) \nCommunication plan: Engineering Student Services, Programs and \nstudents will be informed of the regulation changes through a number of \ndirected communications (supervisors, chairs, associate chairs, and \ndirectors) and mass communications (emails, info boards).  As we intend \nto allow current to undertake minors even if not in their acceptance \ncalendar, students will need to agree to the new EGA calculations and \ndistinction definition. Communication with students, students groups and \nprograms will be critical to this process. \nImplementation plan: Faculty of engineering is developing a set of \nprogram specific procedures and software to automate the new EGA \ncalculation and identification of students awarded distinction.  \nSupplementary Notes and \ncontext \nEngagement and Routing (Include meeting dates) \nParticipation: \n(parties who have seen the \nproposal and in what capacity) \n<For further information see \nthe link posted on \nthe Governance Toolkit section \nStudent Participation Protocol> \nThose who have been informed: \n•  \nThose who have been consulted: \n• Faculty of Engineering Academic Planning Committee – June 15, \n2016 \n•  \nThose who are actively participating: \n•  \nApproval Route (Governance) \n(including meeting dates) \nFaculty of Engineering Executive Coordinating Committee – September \n20, 2016 \nFaculty of Engineering Council – ECC has the delegated authority of \nFaculty of Engineering Council in unanimous ECC votes; vote for this \nproposal was unanimous.   \nGFC Academic Standing Committee – November 17, 2016 \nFinal Approver GFC Academic Standing Committee  \nAlignment/Compliance \nAlignment with Guiding \nDocuments \nThe proposal aligns with “For the Public Good” by  \n• Creating new EXPERIENCES through a unique rewarding \nlearning opportunity that will inspire a new breed of engineering \nstudents, expand their knowledge and skills, and enable their \ngreater success. \n• BUILD a community of exceptional students  \n• Allow our students to EXCEL in their chosen profession and \nbecome INTERDISCIPLINARY leaders, and strengthen key, non-\ntechnical GRADUATE ATTRIBUTES to improve graduate \noutcomes. \n• ENGAGING community and world leaders to create mutually \nbeneficial learning experiences \nCompliance with Legislation, \nPolicy and/or Procedure \nRelevant to the Proposal \n(please quote legislation and \n1.

These students have a \npattern of low grades in the foundation courses (e.g. Anatomy & \nPhysiology, Pathophysiology, Microbiology). That means they have had \nD, D+ or C's in often more than one of the foundation courses.  \nWe have also completed an environmental scan (review of progression \npolicies/calendar statements) of other comparable BSN programs in \nCanada and the US, and have determined that the majority of nursing \nprograms do indeed have a higher \"minimum pass\" standard for their \nprograms (higher than the standard University-wide grading scale). The \nrange for such a minimum pass was 70-76% and some programs used \nthis for only selected courses, while other programs required this higher \nbar for all courses in the nursing program.  \nOur decision to institute this foundation course minimum pass was based \non data and best practice and the intent is to support students and \nensure that they have the strong foundational knowledge required to be \nsuccessful in the higher level nursing courses, and prevent them from \nfalling out of sequence and repeating clinical courses. Repeating clinical \ncourses is often problematic due to the scarcity of clinical placements \nand this may require students to wait until a placement becomes \navailable, and thus increase the length of their program. \nReplaces/Revises (eg, policies, \nresolutions) \nN/A \nTimeline/Implementation Date Fall 2017 \nEstimated Cost and funding N/A \nASC - Nov 17, 2016 - Item 10 - page 1\nItem No. 10 \nGFC ACADEMIC STANDARDS COMMITTEE \nFor the Meeting of November 17, 2016 \nsource \nNext Steps (ie.: \nCommunications Plan, \nImplementation plans) \nSupplementary Notes and \ncontext \nEngagement and Routing (Include meeting dates) \nParticipation: \n(parties who have seen the \nproposal and in what capacity) \n<For further information see \nthe link posted on the \nGovernance Toolkit section \nStudent Participation Protocol> \nThose who have been informed: \n• Vice-Provost & University Registrar, Sep 23, 2016 \nThose who have been consulted: \n• Office of the Registrar, Exams and Timetabling, Oct 5, 2016 \n• Faculté Saint-Jean, at Bilingual Leadership Team Meeting on \nSept 14, 2016 \n• GFC ASC Subcommittee on Standards – November 3, 2016 \nThose who are actively participating: \n• Faculty Caucus discussed changes (student representative on \nFaculty Council received Agenda and meeting material but was \nnot in attendance) – Sept 13, 2016 \n• Faculty of Nursing On-Site Curriculum Committee approved \nchanges (student representative in attendance) – Sept 20, 2016 \n• Faculty of Nursing Council approved changes (student \nrepresentative on Faculty Council received Agenda and meeting \nmaterial but was not in attendance) – Oct 11, 2016 \nApproval Route (Governance) \n(including meeting dates) \nGFC Academic Standards Committee – November 17, 2016 \nFinal Approver GFC Academic Standards Committee \nAlignment/Compliance \nAlignment with Guiding \nDocuments \nFor the Public Good \nGOAL: EXCEL as individuals, and together, sustain a culture that fosters \nand champions distinction and distinctiveness in teaching, learning, \nresearch, and service. \nTo excel and achieve our full potential as an institution and as \nindividuals, the University of Alberta will sustain a learning and research \nculture that inspires, supports, and champions high professional \nstandards and outstanding achievements in basic and applied research \nand scholarship, creative activity, administration, and governance. \nCompliance with Legislation, \nPolicy and/or Procedure \nRelevant to the Proposal \n(please quote legislation and \ninclude identifying section \nnumbers) \n1.

PSLA: The PSLA gives Faculty Councils power to “provide for the \nadmission of students to the faculty” (29(1)(c)). \n3. UAPPOL Admissions Policy: “Admission to the University of Alberta \nis based on documented academic criteria established by individual \nFaculties and approved by GFC. This criteria may be defined in areas \nsuch as subject requirements, minimum entrance averages, and \nlanguage proficiency requirements. In addition to academic requirements \nfor admission, GFC authorizes each Faculty to establish such other \nreasonable criteria for admission of applicants as the Faculty may \nconsider appropriate to its programs of study, subject to the approval of \nGFC (e.g. interview, audition, portfolio, etc.) \nThe admission requirements for any Faculty will be those approved by \nGFC as set forth in the current edition of the University Calendar. In \naddition to the admission requirements, selection criteria for quota \nprograms, where they exist, will also be published in the current edition \nof the University Calendar. The responsibility for admission decisions will \nbe vested in the Faculty Admission Committees or in the Deans of the \nrespective Faculties, as the councils of such Faculties will determine.” \n2. UAPPOL Admissions Procedure: \n“PROCEDURE \n1. EFFECTIVE DATE OF CHANGES TO ADMISSION REGULATIONS \nFollowing approval by GFC: \na. Where changes to admission regulations may disadvantage students \nin the current admission cycle, normally implementation will be \neffective after the change has been published in the University \nCalendar for one full year (i.e., effective the second year that the \ninformation is published in the University Calendar). \nFor example, a change approved in May 2005 would be first published in \nthe 2006-2007 University Calendar in March 2006. Therefore the \nstatement cannot come into effect until September 2007 (affecting \napplicants who apply for the September 2007 term beginning July 2006). \nb. Where changes to admission regulations are deemed by the \napproving body to be ‘advantageous to students’, normally the date of \nimplementation will be effective immediately or at the next available \nintake for the admitting Faculty.” \n5. PSLA: The PSLA gives Faculty Councils the authority to “determine \nthe conditions under which a student must withdraw from or may \ncontinue the student’s program of studies in a faculty” (Section \n29(1)(d)). \n6.

Members are instructed to destroy this material following the meeting. \nProgram Impact and Rationale  \n10. What is the rationale for the program proposal? \nWhen the Honors program in Management Science was first created in 2003, the academic area of \nManagement Science was located within the Department of Finance and Management Science. This area was \nalways a mixture of academics primarily involved in Statistics and those primarily involved in Operations \nManagement. The Honors program in Management Science had always followed the general course \nrequirements for the Operations Management Major, with the addition of some additional Honors program \nrequirements. There never was a Management Science major. \nIn 2011, the Management Science group split into two, with the Operations Management group moving to the \nnewly re-named Department of Accounting, Operations and Information Systems. Responsibility for the \nOperations Management major also moved to the new Department. \nUntil the fall of 2015, there had never been a student in the Honors program in Management Science. The \nprogram had not been looked at in some time and the inconsistency inherent in its title was not noticed. \nHowever, when the student applied to the program, it became apparent that her interest was in Operations \nManagement and that the academic staff member most able to supervise the program was in Operations \nManagement. The courses already required were mainly Operations Management courses, and only a small \namount of adjustment was needed to create an enriched program for this student. Both Departments involved \nreadily agreed that the name change made sense and that the Honors program should be renamed and \nhoused in the same Department that housed Operations Management. \nIt is difficult to compare this nomenclature as Honors programs are not common in Undergraduate Business \ndegrees. But the subject matter of the program is well accepted throughout Canada as “Operations \nManagement”. \n11. Provide the expected enrolment (or other) impact on the academic unit(s) offering the program and other \naffected units if applicable. Include information on the current enrolment.  \nThere is expected to be only minimal impact on the Department given that it is anticipated that the number of \nstudents in this program will always remain small. There is currently 1 student in the Honors program in \nmanagement Science who will be transferred to the Honors program in Operations Management if this \nproposal is approved. It is likely that the program would attract only one new student per year entering into \nYear Three, and a total of two students at steady state which is well within the capacity of the Department. \n12. Do you anticipate an enrolment (or other) impact on programs at other institutions or regulatory bodies?  \nDescribe any consultations that have occurred with other institutions and professional organizations. \nThe new program is not expected to have any adverse effects or impact on any external stakeholders. \nEmployers are substantially more familiar with the title “Operations Management” than they are with \nManagement Science. Other post-secondary institutions that might consider a graduate from an Honors \nprogram for graduate work will be very familiar with this terminology and it will more accurately describe the \nstudent’s program. There have been no consultations with any external organizations. \n13. Are there any resource implications (budget, information technology (IT), library (Library Impact Statement), \nlaboratory, space, student services, administrative services (eg, FGSR, Registrar’s Office, or IST), as \napplicable) for the proposed change? If so, please provide detail and evidence of consultation with affected \nunit(s) and/or appropriate University officers/committees. \nThe new program is not expected to have any major effects on any relevant units within the University of \nAlberta. There may be a minor impact on the Office of the Registrar. There will be no resource implications for \nany unit. The Registrar’s Office has reviewed the material and has no concerns. \nThe only impact on students will be on the single student currently in the program. We are requesting that this \nbe implemented for January 2017 to allow this single student to graduate with this designation. There has \nnever been another student in the program. One of the student members on USPC is an Operations \nManagement major and declared herself “very excited” by this change, feeling it would make the area more \nrelevant to students.\nASC - Nov 17, 2016 - Item 14 - page 6\nAppendix A– Sample Enrolment Table  \nProposed Enrolment 2016-17 2017-18 2018-19 2019-20 \nAnnual \nOngoing \n• Total Full-Time head count 1 1 2 2 2 \n• Full-Time Year 1 0 0 0 0 0 \n• Full-Time Year 2 0 0 0 0 0 \n• Full-Time Year 3 0 1 1 1 1 \n• Full-Time Year 4 1 0 1 1 1 \n• Total Part-Time head count 0 0 0 0 0 \n• Part-Time Year 1 0 0 0 0 0 \n• Part-Time Year 2 0 0 0 0 0 \n• Part-Time Year 3 0 0 0 0 0 \n• Part-Time Year 4 0 0 0 0 0 \n• Total Work Experience hc 0 0 0 0 0 \n• Work Experience Year 1 0 0 0 0 0 \n• Work Experience Year 2 0 0 0 0 0 \n• Work Experience Year 3 0 0 0 0 0 \n• Work Experience Year 4 0 0 0 0 0 \n• Anticipated Number of \nGraduates \n1 1 1 1 1 \nASC - Nov 17, 2016 - Item 14 - page 7\nThis agenda and its corresponding attachments are transitory records.

Application to the Honors \nprogram is normally made immediately prior to or during Year Three of the BCom program. \nHowever, qualified students in any year are encouraged to apply. Acceptance may depend on \nwhether the students have room in their programs to complete Honors requirements. Prospective \nstudents must be currently in the BCom program, or have been accepted for admission to the \nBCom program. Students must normally present a minimum GPA of 3.7. Admission decisions \nwill be made jointly by the Undergraduate Office in Business and the Department responsible for \nadministering the particular Honors program to which the student is applying. \nIII Honors in Operations Management \n1. Students must normally present a minimum GPA of 3.7. \n2. Students will normally have received a grade of A- or higher in ECON 101, ECON 102, \nMATH 113 or MATH 114 and STAT 151, or have otherwise demonstrated excellence in their \nacademic Program. \nHonors in Operations Management [Business] \nProgram \n    The BCom Honors in Operations Management program follows the same general program of \nstudies as the BCom Major in Operations Management.

TSCCN provides educators with the \nknowledge and skills required to effectively support students’ ongoing \ngrowth in communication, language, literacy, and numeracy. \nThe Impact of the Proposal is Students with CCN require specialized supports to promote successful \nparticipation and learning as they work to access the general education \ncurriculum and to achieve general education standards and their \nindividualized learning goals. Most educators currently teaching students \nwith CCN lack the necessary training and experience to use specialized \nsupports effectively and to successfully teach students with CCN. \nTSCCN provides then with the necessary training. \nReplaces/Revises (eg, policies, \nresolutions) \nN/A \nTimeline/Implementation Date September 1, 2017 \nEstimated Cost and funding \nsource \n$70,000 (Alberta Education $62,500; JP Das Centre $7,500) – see \nproposed budget for estimated cost. \nNext Steps (ie.: \nCommunications Plan, \nImplementation plans) \nAdvanced Education for approval.

The \nreview will focus on the institution’s assessment of student and employer demand; the situation of the \nprogram in the context of Campus Alberta; the financial viability of the program, including \nimplications for students and taxpayers; and dimensions of program quality.   \nBasic Information \nInstitution University of Alberta \nProgram/specialization title \nTeaching Students with Complex \nCommunication Needs  \nCredential awarded \nUniversity Certificate in Teaching Students \nwith Complex Communication Needs \nProposed Implementation Date September, 2017 \nASC - Nov 17, 2016 - Item 15 - page 6\nNew Program Proposal – Comprehensive Review 2 \nCertificate/Diploma/Non-credential Programs  \nSECTION 1:  PROGRAM OVERVIEW \n1.1  Type of Initiative \nNew freestanding for credit University Certificate in Teaching Students with Complex Communication Needs. \n(Admission: Bachelor’s Degree) \n1.2  Program Description \nProvide a brief (1-2 paragraphs) description of the program, summarizing its intended purpose, curriculum \ndesign, and methods of delivery and highlighting distinctive attributes.  Attach as an Appendix a complete list of \ncourses, including credit values, instructional hours and brief (calendar style) course descriptions.  For elective \noptions, specify course selection parameters. Identify new courses to be developed for this program.   \nStudents with complex communication needs (CCN) are unable to communicate effectively using speech or \nsigned language alone and benefit from augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) strategies and tools \nto support communication and learning. They may also have vision impairment, hearing loss, physical \nchallenges, cognitive disabilities or some combination of any number of impairments that impact their learning \n(Iacono, 2014; Perry, Reilly, Cotton, Bloomberg, & Johnson, 2004). Students with CCN require specialized \nsupports to promote successful participation and learning as they work to access the general education \ncurriculum and to achieve general education standards and their individualized learning goals. Most educators \ncurrently teaching students with CCN lack the necessary training and experience to use specialized supports \neffectively and to successfully teach students with CCN (Costigan & Light, 2010). AAC is a foundational \ncomponent of instruction for students with CCN, and at present there are no university programs in Canada that \nfocus on teaching students with severe disabilities, such as those typically experienced by this population. The \nproposed free-standing University Certificate in Teaching Students with Complex Communication Needs \n(TSCCN) is a certificate program aimed at practicing teachers, learning coaches, and related professionals with \na Bachelor’s degree who work on multi-disciplinary teams to support the participation and learning of students \nwith CCN. TSCCN builds upon existing courses at the University of Alberta and the professional development \ncourses available at the Center for Literacy and Disability Studies at the University of North Carolina at Chapel \nHill. TSCCN’s goal is to make this critical content available to all Alberta educators and to educators and related \nprofessionals across the globe via online delivery. \nTSCCN provides educators with the knowledge and skills required to effectively support students’ ongoing \ngrowth in communication, language, literacy, and numeracy. TSCCN includes five courses (see Appendix A) \nthat explore the foundational knowledge and research-validated practices in comprehensive language, literacy \nand numeracy education.  The courses will be offered online one at a time in eight to twelve week blocks to \nallow full-time educators to participate. Educators completing TSCCN will be able to: (1) support development of \nand teach language skills to students with CCN through the use of AAC strategies and systems; (2) implement \ncomprehensive research-validated literacy instruction to students with CCN; (3) provide research-validated \ninstruction in numeracy to students with CCN; (4) provide instructional leadership in addressing the needs of \nstudents with CCN in their respective schools and school districts. \nTSCCN is unique in the world in its scope and focus. TSCCN is designed and delivered by a team of experts \nthat includes AAC specialists, literacy specialists, numeracy specialists, special educators, and university \nresearchers committed to promoting quality evidence-based approaches to teaching students with CCN. \nTSCCN is designed to meet the diverse needs of educators across Alberta and beyond. \n1.3  Enrolment Plan \nInclude assumptions and explanatory notes (e.g., attrition, part-time enrolment).   \nASC - Nov 17, 2016 - Item 15 - page 7\nNew Program Proposal – Comprehensive Review 3 \nCertificate/Diploma/Non-credential Programs  \nTo be financially viable and sustainable in terms of instructor resources over a longer period of time, the \nUniversity Certificate in Teaching Students with Complex Communication Needs (TSCCN) will accept new \nstudents every two years and will be offered to a cohort of 25 students over two years. The Department of \nEducational Psychology has offered cohort programs for over 20 years, and recognizes the strengths of the \ncohort model for completion rate, student experience (Seifert and Mandzuk, 2006), and for building professional \nlearning communities (Lei, Gorelick, Short, Smallwood, and Wright-Porter, 2011) that continue collaborating \nafter completion of the program. For example, the Department of Educational Psychology have experienced \nhigh graduation rates for those students who have enrolled in School Counselling and Special Education cohort \nMaster’s programs. \nTSCCN is designed for part-time online study and all students will be part-time students. The maximum \nallowable time to complete the program is four years from the date of registration, but most students are \nexpected to complete the program in two years with their respective cohort. Based on our experience with \ncohort programs, we expect that there will be about 10% attrition due to changing work circumstances and other \nsignificant commitments. Students who will not be able to continue with their cohort will be offered an \nopportunity to complete their program with the next cohort.   \n• If program implementation will occur over a number of years, provide data for each year to full \nimplementation. \nIdeally, TSCCN will start in January 2017 with one cohort of 25 students, 23 of whom are expected to complete \nthe program in year 2. The second cohort will start in year 3 (2019), and so on. We expect to graduate 23 to 25 \nstudents every second year.  \n• If internal reallocation of existing resources is proposed, describe any anticipated decrease in \nenrolment in other programs that would result.   \nNo reallocation of resources is required and as TSCCN does not overlap with existing undergraduate or \ncertificate programs, we don’t anticipate it to affect enrolment in other programs. It may increase interest in \nspecial education graduate programs across Campus Alberta institutions. It may also increase interest in \ngraduate studies in Rehabilitation Medicine at the University of Alberta. \nProposed Enrolment Year 1 2017 \nYear 2 \n2018 \nYear 3 \n2019 \nYear 4 \n2020 \nYear 5 \n2021 \nBiennial \nOngoing \nTotal head count 0 0 0 0 0 0 \n• Part-Time Year 1 25 0 25 0 25 25 EVERY \nSECOND YEAR \n• Part-Time Year 2 0 23 0 23 0 23 EVERY \nSECOND YEAR \nAnticipated No. of Graduates 0 23 0 23 0 23 EVERY \nSECOND YEAR \nASC - Nov 17, 2016 - Item 15 - page 8\nNew Program Proposal – Comprehensive Review 4 \nCertificate/Diploma/Non-credential Programs  \nSECTION 2:  DEMAND \n2.1  Student Demand Analysis \nAnalysis should be supported by relevant data for the region and for Campus Alberta, as might be derived from: \nsystematic questionnaire surveys of target audiences; application and enrolment summaries and trends for \nsimilar programs currently offered by other institutions; tabulations of unsolicited student inquiries and/or \nexpressions of interest obtained at student recruitment events; demographic projections for relevant sub-\npopulations.  \nThe TSCCN certificate proposal has been developed in response to demand from educators across Alberta and \nNorth America for formalized instruction in supporting the communication, literacy, and numeracy development \nof children and youth with CCN. The certificate builds on the professional development work at the Center for \nLiteracy and Disability Studies at the University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, and on current research, \nteaching, and professional development initiatives of scholars at the University of Alberta.  \nAs an indication of demand for this type of coursework, in the summer of 2015, 60 teachers, speech language \npathologists and occupational therapists attended a 5-day summer course on Communication and Literacy for \nStudents with Significant Disabilities taught by Dr. Karen Erickson, Director Center for Literacy and Disability \nStudies, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, David E. & Dolores (Dee) Yoder Distinguished Professor of \nLiteracy and Disability Studies, Director, Center for Literacy & Disability Studies, University of North Carolina at \nChapel Hill, and Dr. David Koppenhaver, Reading Program Director and Professor of Reading Education, \nAppalachian State University. The course was initially capped at 50 participants, but due to the larger demand \nfor this course 10 seats were added. Even with these additional seats, many interested educators were turned \naway. In October 2015, 260 educators attended a preconference session with Dr. Erickson held as part of the \nAlberta Teachers’ Association Council for Inclusive Education conference held in Edmonton. Further, CCN \nCommunity of Practice supported by Alberta Education and Regional Collaborative Service Delivery agencies \nhas over 200 participants that have attended the limited available professional development opportunities across \nthe province over the past two years. \nIn addition to the demand for information on teaching students with CCN across Alberta, Drs. Erickson and \nKoppenhaver do an average of 6 summer courses each year and are booked for trainings two years out. They \nhave done the 5-day courses in Portugal, Australia, and many Canadian provinces.  \nAt present there are no university credit courses that specifically focus on teaching this population of students. \nThis partnership between the JP Das Centre of Developmental and Learning Disabilities at the University of \nAlberta and the Center for Literacy and Disability Studies at the University of North Carolina will create the first \nof its kind certificate in the area of CCN where the emphasis is on literacy and numeracy as well as on \ndeveloping communication skills. Due to the international reputation and reach of the contributors and online \ndelivery, we expect to draw students from around the world. \n2.2  Labour Market Analysis \nAnalysis should be supported by relevant data and placed in the context of the target occupational/regional \nlabour market(s).  Relevant data sources include systematic surveys of prospective employers; occupational \nsupply/demand projections from government or industry sources; tabulations of job postings/‘help wanted’ \nadvertising; surveys of recruitment and graduate employment rates of similar programs; and demographic \nprojections (i.e. for relevant regions and sub-populations.)  Describe anticipated employment outcomes. \nStudents with CCN are identified as a “low-incidence” population. Prevalence data related to the number of \nstudents with complex communication needs vary by country, age and type of disability (Beukelman & Mirenda, \n2013). Recent estimates of the prevalence of complex communication needs among students receiving special \neducation services in different countries vary from a low of 3% of students receiving special education services \nASC - Nov 17, 2016 - Item 15 - page 9\nNew Program Proposal – Comprehensive Review 5 \nCertificate/Diploma/Non-credential Programs  \nin 54 districts in Connecticut (Worah, 2011) to a high of 40% of students served in a variety of special education \nprograms in Israel (Weiss, Seligman-Wine, Lebel, Arzi, & Yalon-Chamovitz, 2005). Among preschoolers \nreceiving special education services in sites in Pennsylvania the reported prevalence was 12% (Binger & Light, \n2006), while 39% of students with severe intellectual disability were reported to have complex communication \nneeds in 19 schools in South Africa (Alant, 1999). Similar studies have not been completed in Alberta but \nCentral Alberta RCSD (see the attached letter of support) currently serves 98 children and assesses about 35 \nmore each year in their limited geographical area, and Calgary and Area RCSD serves over 400 learners with \nCCN (see the attached letter of support); on the basis of these numbers, we estimate that the overall frequency \nvaries between one and three students per school in typical inclusive education settings.  \nDespite the apparent low incidence of this population, speech-language pathologists, special education \nteachers, and occupational therapists are all likely to encounter individuals with complex communication needs \nwho require augmentative and alternative communication (AAC) in clinical and educational practice (Costigan & \nLight, 2010).  Up to 48% of speech-language pathologists working in the U.S. report that they work with students \nwho are non-verbal or use augmentative/alternative communication systems (ASHA, 2014). Similarly, up to 80% \nof special education teachers reported that they provided services to individuals with CCN (ASHA, 2002; Locke \n& Mirenda, 1992). The need for educators, particularly special educators, to have knowledge and skills in \nteaching children with CCN is great. There is also an increasing need for specialized professionals to support \ngeneral education teachers who have students with CCN in their classrooms. A recent study commissioned by \nthe Alberta Teachers Association to understand the state of inclusion in Alberta classrooms indicates that \nteachers are dissatisfied with availability of specialized professional supports (ATA, 2015) and this \ndissatisfaction is expressed with an increase in demand for professional development in the area (see above).  \nThe Government of Alberta recently established the Regional Collaborative Service Delivery (RCSD) model. \nThis model was created to support collaboration across the ministries of Education, Health and Human \nServices. Children and youth with CCN have been identified as one of the groups specifically targeted through \nthis effort. Extra funding resources are available to regions to provide appropriate supports and services for \nthese students, but there are insufficient numbers of professionals available to provide the supports and \nservices. In a recent survey of the Leadership teams, the need for professional expertise in the area of CCN was \nstrongly indicated. As a result, Alberta Education provided a grant for the development of this certificate and a \nletter of support (see attached).  \n2.3  Support \nProvide evidence of consultation with and approval/support from relevant professional organizations, \nregulatory bodies, advisory committees, employers, and/or industry. \nLetters of support from Alberta Education, the College of Alberta School Superintendents, Alberta Teachers’ \nAssociation, Center for Literacy & Disability Studies in University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, nine different \nRegional Collaborative Service Delivery agencies, and Universities of Athabasca, Calgary and Lethbridge are \nattached.  \n2.4  Clinical or Work Experience \nIf clinical or work experience is an essential part of program delivery: \n2.4.1 Provide evidence that the placements will be available when needed. \n2.4.2 Describe the student’s role in securing placements. \n2.4.3 Explain how the institution will supervise/monitor the learning experience of students in off-site settings? \n2.4.4 Identify potential employer/employee liability related to this aspect of the program, and how the institution \nintends to manage this liability. \nASC - Nov 17, 2016 - Item 15 - page 10\nNew Program Proposal – Comprehensive Review 6 \nCertificate/Diploma/Non-credential Programs  \nSECTION 3:  INSTITUTIONAL AND SYSTEM CONTEXT \n3.1  Institutional Strategy \nHow does the proposed program align with the institution’s strategic priorities and the Comprehensive \nInstitutional Plan? \nThe proposed program is in line with the University of Alberta’s new Institutional Strategic Plan “For the Public \nGood” whose mission statement includes benefitting society through teaching and learning, community \ninvolvement, and partnerships. Further, TSCCN aligns closely with four of the seven value statements by \npromoting (1) the equality and dignity of all persons, (2) excellence in teaching that enriches experiences, \nadvances knowledge, and promotes public good, (3) the provision of intellectually rewarding educational \nexperiences to learners at all stages of life, and (4) the diversity, inclusivity and equity among some of the most \nvulnerable student populations.     \nMore specifically, TSCCN directly serves to materialize Objective 9 of the Plan: Expand access to and \nengagement in continuing and professional education programs, experiences, and lifelong learning activities. \nTSCCN provides engaging and critical learning opportunities to professionals by offering them pathways for \npursuit of specialized interests, cross-disciplinary learning, and professional and academic development. The \ncertificate is offered as credit courses to allow participating teachers to use university credits for salary \nincrement purposes. Further, TSCCN is designed and delivered by a team of experts that includes AAC \nspecialists, literacy specialists, special educators, and university researchers committed to knowledge-\nmobilization of research-validated approaches to teaching students with CCN. TSCCN will promote dialogue \nbetween university researchers and practicing teachers, and between teachers at different parts of the province \nand the world. It will help create learning communities focused on the best practices with students with CCN. \nTSCCN aims to provide exceptional and life-changing experiences to the participants by providing them with the \nknowledge, skills, and attitudes required to facilitate the research-validated practices in the schools they serve \nthat will promote successful participation and learning of their students with CCN. \n3.2  Institutional Programs \nExplain how the proposed program fits with existing programs at the institution, and the anticipated positive or \nnegative impacts on other programs. \nTSCCN is unique and has no overlap with existing certificate, undergraduate or graduate programs, and thus it \nis not expected to impact these in any manner. Due to its focus on providing quality instruction to a very specific \ngroup of learners, TSCCN will provide teachers who complete it an excellent entry-point for graduate studies in \npsychology, special education, rehabilitation medicine, speech language pathology, and language and literacy \nstudies. Such graduate programs are currently offered in multiple faculties at the University of Alberta (Faculty \nof Education, Department of Educational Psychology and the Faculty of Rehabilitation Medicine) as well as in \nother Campus Alberta institutions. \n3.3  Internal Review and Approval \nProvide a brief description of the internal review and approval process followed in developing the proposal. \nThis proposal was developed in consultation with Dr. Randy Wimmer, Acting Dean of the Faculty of Education, \nYvonne Norton, Assistant Dean, Dr. Lynn McGarvey, Vice Dean, Dr. Jacqueline Leighton, Department Chair of \nEducational Psychology, Dr. Rauno Parrila, Professor and Director of JP Das Centre on Developmental and \nLearning Disabilities, and Dr. Karen Erickson, the Director of the Center for Literacy and Disability Studies, a \nProfessor in the Division of Speech and Hearing Sciences, and the Yoder Distinguished Professor in the \nDepartment of Allied Health Sciences, School of Medicine at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. \nThe proposal was presented for review and accepted by the Department of Educational Psychology Department \nASC - Nov 17, 2016 - Item 15 - page 11\nNew Program Proposal – Comprehensive Review 7 \nCertificate/Diploma/Non-credential Programs  \nCouncil in January 2016.  Faculty of Education accepted the proposal in June 2016 through the Undergraduate \nAcademic Affairs Council.   \n3.4  Campus Alberta Programs/Initiatives \nDiscuss the relationships (similarity, complementarity, transfer, competition) of the proposed program to other \nprograms or initiatives in Campus Alberta and explain what the proposed program would add to the system.  If \nthe proposed program would duplicate existing programs, explain why that duplication is warranted.   \nThe proposed program is unique in North America and the world. No other program in Canada focuses on the \nunique skills and knowledge necessary for teaching students with complex communication needs. The Special \nEducation Master’s program at the University of Alberta focuses on Reading, Writing, and Oral Language \nDisabilities, but particularly considers higher functioning populations. University of Calgary offers a Master’s \nprogram in Language and Literacy that focuses on cultural and linguistic diversity. University of Lethbridge offers \na Master’s program in Teaching, Learning and Neuroscience that focuses on brain-based education. Athabasca \nUniversity offers an Inclusive Education Minor that includes a course in assistive technology; assistive \ntechnology courses have also been offered periodically at University of Alberta and University of Calgary and \nthey are the only ones that have some overlapping content with the current certificate.  \n3.5  Consultation \nSummarize the type and outcomes of consultations with other institutions offering related programs. Attach \ncopies of relevant documents (e.g. letters, meeting summaries).  Discuss the potential for inter-institutional \ncollaboration.   \nNo other institutions offer related programs. However, the courses for TSCCN have been developed in \ncollaboration with experts from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. Consultation with outside experts \nwill continue with regards to assessment of the program’s impact and its further development, as well as in \nidentifying the best instructors for each course. Letters of support for TSCCN from University of Calgary, \nUniversity of Lethbridge, and Athabasca University are attached. \n3.6  Learner Pathways \n3.6.1 Identify potential pathways from work to school (where applicable). \nTSCCN participants will be practicing teachers and other professionals (e.g., Speech Language Pathologists) \nstudying part time. We expect that upon completion of the certificate, some will be interested in pursuing further \nstudies at the graduate level either full- or part-time. \n3.6.2 Identify potential opportunities for transfer/laddering into the proposed program from other institutions or \nother programs within the institution; and for transfer/laddering from the proposed program to other \nprograms within the institution or at other institutions.  List any formal agreements for internal or inter-\ninstitutional transfer/laddering that have been negotiated to this point. \nAs TSCCN is a free-standing university certificate that requires a Bachelor’s Degree for entry, students will not \ntransfer or ladder into TSCCN from other programs. Further, since the admission criteria for university \ncertificates and graduate level degree programs differ, and because the courses taken as part of this certificate \nmay be taken at the undergraduate level, there is no automatic laddering from this certificate to other programs, \nsuch as a graduate-level Master’s program.  \n3.6.3 Estimate the portion of graduates who can be expected to proceed to further education directly. At a later \nstage in their careers.  What types of programs/credentials would they be most likely to pursue?   \nASC - Nov 17, 2016 - Item 15 - page 12\nNew Program Proposal – Comprehensive Review 8 \nCertificate/Diploma/Non-credential Programs  \nWe expect that about a third of the graduates will consider graduate studies immediately upon completion and \nabout ten percent will pursue graduate studies one to three years subsequent to the completion of the \ncertificate.  \nSECTION 4:  FINANCIAL VIABILITY AND SUSTAINABILITY \n4.1  Annual Budget and Funding Sources \nIdentify annual and one-time expenditures and annual revenue for the program in the budget tables below.  If \nprogram implementation will take place over more than one year, provide estimates for each year until full \nimplementation.  Provide explanatory notes for all budget assumptions, such as inflation and per student tuition. \n(For proposals without significant impacts on institutional costs, revenues or enrolment, a detailed budget presentation will \nnot normally be required (please confirm with the department).  Such proposals will satisfy all of the following tests: \n1. The proposal is for a new specialization in an existing program, consisting of an innovative combination of existing \ncurricula. \n2. Overall enrolment capacity in the program is maintained. \n3.

The proposed tuition is in line with other Education certificate programs under \nconsideration at the University of Alberta. At $1600 per student/per course (plus future CPI indexed increases), \nthe program is calculated to recover the instructional, administrative, and support costs associated with running \nit after the first year even if enrolment in a cohort falls to 20 students.    \n4.2.2 Discuss the financial impact on students and the learner funding system, taking into account the costs of \neducation and the potential debt burden relative to post-graduation earning capacity. \nThe cost for students will be $1,600 per course (plus future CPI indexed increases), or $8,000 for the program \nover the course of two years. We assume that school boards will allow their teachers to use existing \nprofessional development funds to support the tuition fees and make tuition supplements available.  \n4.2.3 If program funding includes internal reallocation, evaluate the impact of this reallocation on the \ninstitution’s operations and overall financial position. \nNot applicable \nASC - Nov 17, 2016 - Item 15 - page 14\nNew Program Proposal – Comprehensive Review 10 \nCertificate/Diploma/Non-credential Programs  \nSECTION 5:  QUALITY ASSESSMENT \n5.1 Institutional Capacity \n5.1.1 List instructional positions that would support the proposed program, specifying position title, credential \nand experience requirements, and areas of expertise.  Distinguish between new and existing positions; \nand regular and sessional appointments.  Describe mechanisms (existing and planned) to develop and \nensure currency of teaching skills and disciplinary expertise. \nThe TSCCN content has been developed jointly by the JP Das Centre on Developmental and Learning \nDisabilities at the University of Alberta and the Center for Literacy and Disability Studies at the University of North \nCarolina at Chapel Hill. The course development is funded by a grant from Alberta Education. \nThe developers of specific TSCCN courses will be offered an opportunity to teach those courses. When they are \nnot available, they will be asked to identify other experts who can be asked to contribute. Postdoctoral and PhD \nresearch fellows at the Center for Literacy and Disability Studies, the JP Das Centre, and the Department of \nEducational Psychology at the University of Alberta will provide additional sources of expertise to support this \ncertificate. \nAs topics covered by TSCCN overlap significantly with research interests of the professors involved, currency of \nthe disciplinary expertise will be maintained. Similarly, as all instructors are active instructors in Education or \nrelated professions in university settings, currency of teaching skills should not be an issue. \n5.1.2 List instructional support positions (e.g. lab technicians, tutors) related to the proposed program.  \nTSCCN will be supported by graduate teaching assistants (GTAs at the PhD level) and one part-time \nadministrative assistant who is responsible for the technology maintenance and program administration. Costs \nfor these positions are included in the salary and benefits line of the budget above.  \n5.1.3 Describe facilities, equipment and information resources (existing and planned) that would house and \nsupport delivery of the proposed program. \nAll necessary facilities and equipment exist in the JP Das Centre and the Center for Literacy and Disability \nStudies; no new facilities are required besides a computer and necessary software for the administrative \nassistant. The University of Alberta library currently provides all the information resources needed, and the \nuniversity provides a platform for delivering online instruction (eClass).  \n5.1.4 Discuss the anticipated impacts of the proposed program on student support services. \nNo impact is anticipated due to all students being part-time students who take their courses online. All courses \ninclude a full-time GTA who will provide the students with technical support. \n5.2 Curriculum  \nThe curriculum for the proposed TSCCN program was developed based on the work of the Centre for Literacy \nand Disability Studies, in particular the professional development series that was created to support the \nDynamic Learning Maps Alternative Assessment and the research done at the Center in the area of effective \ncommunication and literacy practices for students with CCN. \nASC - Nov 17, 2016 - Item 15 - page 15\nNew Program Proposal – Comprehensive Review 11 \nCertificate/Diploma/Non-credential Programs  \nThe curriculum development was further supported by the identification of educators’ professional learning \nneeds during the Communication and Literacy Summer Courses and the demand for ongoing professional \ndevelopment by the Alberta Professional Development Consortia and the ATA Inclusive Education Specialist \nCouncil. \n5.3 Academic Standards \nList the requirements for admission and any alternate routes to admission; for residency; for academic \nprogression; and for graduation.  Compare these requirements to those for similar programs. \nWe want TSCCN certificate be accessible to all teachers who need it. For this reason, the program is offered as \na university certificate rather than as a post-baccalaureate certificate that would require the applicants to meet \nthe general admission requirements of the Faculty of Graduate Studies and Research. The admission \nrequirements are as follows: \nTo be eligible for admission to University Certificate programs applicants must: \n(1) present a three- or four-year degree from an accredited postsecondary institution \n(2) meet the English Language proficiency requirements as specified in §13.3. \nSupporting Documents  \n(1) Official post-secondary degree transcripts demonstrating that the degree has been awarded.  \n(2) Most recent post-secondary transcripts, if they are from a different institution than (1). (Optional) \n(3) Letter of intent. \nGraduation: Certificates will be awarded for the successful completion of the designated courses within the \nCertificate and with a final GPA of 2.0 or above. Certificates must be completed within four years. \nApplication and Document Deadline: Applications will be submitted directly to the Faculty of Education and are \ndue one month before the next intake. Completed applications will be reviewed by TSCCN Admission \nCommittee.      \n5.4  Learning Outcomes    \n5.4.1 Summarize the learning outcomes of the proposed program (e.g. career-specific knowledge and skills, \nemployability skills).   \nTSCCN will provide special education teachers and other professionals with advanced knowledge and skills on \nhow to: \n• Implement Augmentative and Alternative Communication methods in the context of educational \nexperiences; \n• Design and deliver comprehensive literacy instruction for students with CCN; \n• Implement research-validated literacy and numeracy instruction and interventions to students with CCN \nin a variety of educational contexts;  \n• Work as a part of a multidisciplinary team in planning and delivering instruction to students with CCN; \nand \n• Provide effective leadership in their respective schools. \nTSCCN consists of five courses that focus on instructional design and methods, augmentative and alternative \ncommunication, emergent literacy, conventional literacy, and numeracy. \nThe key learning outcomes of each course are explained below.  \n1. Teaching Students with Complex Communication Needs: Instructional Design and Methods \nThis course will provide an overview of instructional practices that guide teaching and learning for \nstudents with complex communication needs.

The course will emphasize the use of symbol and text based communication \nsystems and systematically designed instruction that includes daily opportunities for developing \nconventional skills in word reading (decoding and automatic word identification), text comprehension, \nsilent reading fluency, and writing. Upon completion of this course, the participants will be able to: \n• Understand the principles of effective, comprehensive, conventional reading and writing instruction.  \nASC - Nov 17, 2016 - Item 15 - page 17\nNew Program Proposal – Comprehensive Review 13 \nCertificate/Diploma/Non-credential Programs  \n• Identify learners who are most likely to benefit from comprehensive, conventional reading and \nwriting instruction. \n• Describe how to support learning and use of AAC systems throughout conventional literacy \ninstruction. \n• Design specific lessons that address word reading, comprehension, silent reading fluency, and \nwriting for students with complex communication needs.  \n• Determine appropriate tools for individual students with complex motor impairments to use when \ngenerating text during instruction in the cognitive acts of writing. \n• Create a comprehensive instructional plan that fosters communication and conventional literacy \ndevelopment for students with complex communication needs.  \n• Use technologies, media, and materials that can positively impact conventional literacy \ndevelopment and demonstrations.  \n• Identify assessment approaches that are accessible and effective for students with complex \ncommunication needs. \n5. Teaching Students with Complex Communication Needs: Numeracy  \nThis course focuses on quality instruction in mathematics (including numeracy) and how it can be made \naccessible to students with complex communication needs. The course will emphasize the use of \nsymbol and text based augmentative and alternative communication systems, accessible instructional \nmaterials, and systematically designed instruction to support understandings of number sense; spatial \nreasoning; principles of geometry, measurement, data, and analytic procedures; and mathematical \nproblem solving including algebra. Upon completion of this course, the participants will be able to:  \n• Create an instructional environment that supports the learning of mathematics for students with \nCCN in order to foster conceptual mathematics understanding, application, and enjoyment. \n• Select and design mathematics tasks and tools that promote inquiry and problem solving, yet are \naccessible to students with CCN who often have co-occurring physical impairments. \n• Describe the importance of multiple means of representation in teaching mathematical thinking and \nproblem solving.  \n• With specific attention to the needs of students with complex communication needs describe \nprocesses for:  \no developing number sense.  \no teaching counting and cardinality  \no teaching calculation (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division). \no teaching measurement \no developing an understanding of basic geometric shapes and their attributes. \n• Create a comprehensive instructional plan that fosters communication and the development of \nmathematics skills and understandings.  \n5.4.2 Describe the consultative process with employers, industry/professional bodies or advisory groups that \nhelped formulate these learning outcomes. \nThe outcomes for the TSCCN program were developed in consultation with experts in the field of special \neducation, augmentative and alternative communication, and literacy. In specific, the program was developed in \ncollaboration with the Center for Literacy & Disability Studies, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (see the \nattached letter of support). \n5.4.3 Provide evidence of alignment/compliance with regulatory, industry, program accreditation and \nprofessional accreditation standards relevant to the program. \nNot applicable \nASC - Nov 17, 2016 - Item 15 - page 18\nNew Program Proposal – Comprehensive Review 14 \nCertificate/Diploma/Non-credential Programs  \n5.5  Institutional Quality Assurance     \n5.5.1 Describe the criteria and methods for evaluating the success of the program and achieving continuous \nquality improvement.  Include expected outcomes, key performance indicators and performance targets \nfor the program.   \n1. Upon entry to the program, all students will be asked to complete a series of questionnaires assessing \ntheir (a) orientation to special education, (b) knowledge of universal design for learning and AAC, (c) \nknowledge of literacy and numeracy constructs, and (d) self-efficacy as special education teachers.  \n2. After every course, the students will complete the regular university online USRI evaluation forms. \n3. After every course, the students will complete a customized feedback form inquiring what aspects of the \ncourse were most useful in improving their instructional practice, what aspects we less useful, and \nadditional content they would like to see included in the course.  \n4. At the end of the program, all students will be asked to complete the same questionnaires as in the \nbeginning of the program.  \n5. Once a year, a program advisory committee (described in greater detail in 5.5.2) will examine the impact \nof the program, student feedback, evaluation results, and recommend changes when and where \nneeded.  \n5.5.2 Indicate whether a program advisory committee is planned or in place and, if so, comment on the role of \nthe committee in program quality assurance.  \nProgram advisory committee will consist of the Director of the JP Das Centre, the Director of Center for Literacy \nand Disability Studies, the Chair (or designate) of the Department of Educational Psychology, the Dean (or \ndesignate) of the Faculty of Education at the University of Alberta, and one representative of course instructors. \nThe committee task is to examine the impact of the program, student feedback, student evaluation results, and \nrecommend changes when and where needed. \nRECOMMENDATION (FOR DEPARTMENT USE) \nDo Any Issues or Information Gaps Remain? \nRecommendation(s) \nReviewer(s) \nDate Completed \nASC - Nov 17, 2016 - Item 15 - page 19\nASC - Nov 17, 2016 - Item 15 - page 20\nCASS \nOffice: #1200, 9925 – 109 Street, Edmonton, Alberta T5K 2J8 \nPhone: (780) 451-7106    FAX: (780) 482-5659    E-mail: barry.litun@cass.ab.ca   Website: www.cass.ab.ca \nCOLLEGE OF ALBERTA SCHOOL SUPERINTENDENTS \nApril 14, 2016 \nDr. Randy Wimmer, Interim Dean of Education \nUniversity of Alberta \n845 Education S \n11210 - 87 Ave. \nEdmonton, AB T6G 2G5 \nEmail – rwimmer@ualberta.ca \nDear Dr. Wimmer:  \nOn behalf of the College of Alberta School Superintendents (CASS), I am writing in support of \nyour proposed University Certificate in Teaching Students with Complex Communication Needs.  \nThe recommendation is based on information and recommendation I have received from Dr. \nDianne McConnell, who chairs the CASS Inclusive Education Committee. Dr. McConnell \nbelieves the program would be instrumental in developing capacity of Alberta teachers, enabling \nthem to support students that are among the most disadvantaged in our schools. \nThe certificate program supports Goal 1 of the current CASS Strategic Plan, which states \nAdvocacy for Students is Ongoing and Courageous. The program addresses two objectives \nwithin the goal, specifically: \na) Champion research on educational matters to help inform policy, decision-making, and \npractice across Alberta’s education system; and \nb) Forge strategic alliances to support and enhance the use of research as a tool to \nimprove student engagement, learning, and achievement. \nOne of the most powerful factors in supporting success for every student, including those with \nunique learning needs, is a knowledgeable and skilled teacher in the classroom. The Certificate \nin Teaching Students with Complex Communication Needs will play an important role in \nensuring that students across the province have access to teachers who are skilled at \nsupporting communication, language, literacy and numeracy.  I appreciate the work you and \nyour colleagues are doing to improve the pedagogy of Alberta teachers.  \nSincerely,  \nBarry Litun \nExecutive Director \nCc: John Waterhouse, CASS President 2015/16 \n Dr. Dianne McConnell, Chair CASS Inclusive Education Committee \nASC - Nov 17, 2016 - Item 15 - page 21\nmailto:rwimmer@ualberta.ca\n~h Alberta ~ ~V~aS~ID\nTeachers’ Association ~ir~j~t ~a~e~uat~e\n191% Robert J Twerdoclib Sharon L Vogrinetz\n11010 142 Street NW, Edmonton, Alberta T5N 2R1 Vice-President Assistant Executive Secretary\nCarol D HendersonT 780-447-9400 or 18002327208 Past President\nF 780-455-6481\nwww.teachers.ab.ca\n2016 05 09\nDr Lynn McGarvey\nProfessor and Vice Dean\n845 Education South\nFa~’uI~ of Fducation\nUniversity of Alberta\nEdmonton AB T6G 2G5\nDear Dr McGarvey\nRe University Certificate (Undergraduate) in Teaching Students with Complex\nCommunication Needs\nPlease accept this short correspondence indicating the profession’s support for the new\nUniversity Certificate (Undergraduate) in Teaching Students with Complex Communication\nNeeds.

As the Director of the Center for Literacy and Disability Studies at the University \nof North Carolina at Chapel Hill, I understand the significant need for such a program and \nlook forward to working with you to develop and implement the program.   \nIn the summer of 2015, my colleague, David Koppenhaver and I taught a weeklong \nintensive seminar in literacy and complex communication needs at the University of Alberta.  \nWe extended the capacity for the course two times in order to begin to address the need \nacross the province. Even with an enrollment exceeding 60, we barely scratched the surface \nof interest and need.  The proposed certificate program has the potential to much more \neffectively address the need as the online format will dramatically increase the number of \npre-service and in-service educators who can participate.  \nAs a partner on this project, we are excited to work with faculty and staff at the University of \nAlberta to create the content for the courses in literacy and numeracy.  We have already been \nactively engaged in conceptualizing the program and developing initial course syllabi. As the \nprogram moves forward, we look forward to more work creating the courses themselves and \nteaching them when the program launches.   \nAll the best as you process the program proposal.  \nSincerely,  \nKaren A.

We understand that you are currently at \nthe stage of seeking University approval for this certificate.  \nWe are very supportive of providing this opportunity for teachers and other \nprofessionals as we know that we have many children and youth in our regions who \nrequire intensive support to have their communication needs meet through the use of \naugmentative and alternative communication. To support the needs of these children \nand youth, teachers require very specialized training and we understand that this course \nwork will support our teachers in developing those skills. \nWe were very pleased to hear that this course work is to be delivered online. As a \nnumber of our RCSDs are rural, professional will have equal access from across the \nprovince to complete this certificate. \nIn conclusion, we agree that this certification program is need to meet the needs of our \nchildren and youth. \nSincerely; \nSandra Zesko   Cathy Gukert \nAspen Collaborative   Central Alberta \nDenis Potvin    Terry Ramsay \nEastern Edge   Edmonton \nPatti Hill    Vicki Cooke \nLeduc and Area   St. Albert/Sturgeon \nParkland, Evergreen and Area \nASC - Nov 17, 2016 - Item 15 - page 25\nTo whom it may concern, \nThis letter is to express our Northern Lakes Collaborative Services (NLCS) Regional                       \nCollaborative Services Delivery (RCSD) regional support for the development of the Teaching                       \nStudents with Complex Communication Needs (CCN) certificate.   \nAs a Northern Alberta RCSD region we see great need for and demand for this certificate now                                 \nand in the future. While the focus is on teachers, there is no doubt that Speech­Language                               \nPathologists, Occupational Therapists and other members of interdisciplinary teams will also be                       \ninterested in the certificate. The certificate could also lead to an MEd in Special (Inclusive)                             \nEducation, which may be of interest to some educators. \nWith the advent of RCSD regions were asked to build capacity within schools, families and                             \ncommunities and create resources to successfully support children and youth with CCN. Out of                           \nall low­incidence needs CCN is the one with the highest population numbers and it is a                               \nchallenge to provide adequate services to this population. \nAlthough there is great intent in following this request and also a growing recognition of the                               \nnumbers of children and youth who have complex communication needs (CCN) this is a very                             \nchallenging, time consuming and at times frustrating task especially for regions that are remote                           \nand have minimal resources at their fingertips. A lack of training and support for teachers who                               \nhave these children and youths in their classrooms and/or for teachers whose work involved                           \nsupporting classroom teachers (Learning Support Teachers, Special Educators, etc.) is one of                       \nmany barriers. Having access to online trainings such as this certificate will allow teachers and                             \nservice providers from across Alberta to obtain this important, yet very difficult to find, training. \nTeachers and service providers in Alberta and other provinces currently do not get the                           \nspecialized training needed to provide quality instruction, consultative services and supports to                       \nchildren and youth with CCN in their current university programs. Children and youth with CCN                             \nprovide unique challenges to educators and service providers as they do not have the oral                             \nlanguage abilities that are often taken for granted by educators. Their educational needs are                           \nfurther complicated by their needs for augmentative and alternative communication (AAC)                     \ndevices and supports. \nWhile AAC has been understood to be the domain of Speech Language Pathologists (see SAC                             \nposition paper for more information         \n(​http://www.sac­oac.ca/professional­resources/resource­library/sac­position­paper­role­speech­l\nanguage­pathologists­respect ) current research suggests the role of the teacher is critical in                         \neducational success of students with CCN (Beukelman & Mirenda, 2013; Loncke, 2014; Soto &                           \nZangari, 2009). And although AAC is an area targeted by Speech­language Pathologists, most                         \nASC - Nov 17, 2016 - Item 15 - page 26\nhttp://www.sac-oac.ca/professional-resources/resource-library/sac-position-paper-role-speech-language-pathologists-respect\nhttp://www.sac-oac.ca/professional-resources/resource-library/sac-position-paper-role-speech-language-pathologists-respect\ngraduates would make use and benefit of a CCN certificate. During recent job interviews it was                               \nthe number one area being identified by graduating students that they would like to learn more                               \nabout and would like to have access to additional mentoring to best be able to support the                                 \nchildren and youth on their caseloads. \nIn Alberta, speech and language services in schools are primarily consultative in nature, leaving                           \nthe teacher and educational assistants to implement not only educational supports for students                         \nwith CCN but also AAC supports. In order to do so, teachers require the specialized training that                                 \na certificate such as the one under development by the University of Alberta and University of                               \nNorth Carolina at Chapel Hill. \nThere has been tremendous uptake by teachers and service providers across the province in                           \nin­service training that is being offered at both the provincial and regional level.

This service has meant that children and youth have access \nto assessment services and trial devices locally rather than travelling to Alberta Children’s Hospital in \nCalgary.  There have been increases in the use of low-tech (ex. PODD books), mid-tech  and high-tech (ex. \nNova chat)) devices. Over the past two years, we have moved from a caseload of about 10 children to \nserving over 40 in 2015-16. The numbers continue to grow as we expand our identification and \nunderstanding of the needs of children with CCN. The increasing number of identified children and youth \nusing communication devices in classrooms has meant that front-line professionals need to increase their \nknowledge of alternative communication systems and their implementation in school, home, and \ncommunity environments.   \nOur SE  RCSD has provided funds for professional development of teachers and SLPs in this area. The 5 day \ncourse in Edmonton with Dr. Karen Erickson and David Koppenhaver in July 2015, was funded by RCSD and \nhad great impact in expanding our understanding of CCN, in pockets. We need to continue professional \nASC - Nov 17, 2016 - Item 15 - page 28\nmailto:rauno.parrila@ualberta.ca\ndevelopment and continue to expand our understanding of the communication and educational needs of \nthis population across our region.  \nFor the past two years, the Province-wide Low Incidence Team has offered a summer symposium in \nLethbridge with one of the sessions focused on complex communication.  In both years, the complex \ncommunication session has been well attended by teachers, educational assistants, and health professionals \nseeking to increase their ability to support students using AAC.  \nWe are very interested in the development of a certificate program that would be available to both \neducation and health professionals, especially given the option for distance/virtual delivery.  Not unlike \nother rural communities in the province, finding a way to release staff to attend courses in Edmonton is \nchallenging.  The development of an online certificate program available through the University of Alberta is \na tremendous opportunity for our professionals working and living in Southeast Alberta communities.  \nWe look forward to hearing more about the program once approved through the University processes.  \nSincerely, \nDonna Balas \nRegional Manager \ncc.

We are mandated by the provincial government to work \ncollaboratively across levels and systems and share our collective, limited resources and expertise as we \nsupport over 400 children and youth with complex learning and communication needs in the Calgary \narea. \nWe work closely with our partners to learn about and adopt consistent communication methods and \ntools across systems.  In April we hosted a professional education day which focused on teaching \nmethods for emergent literacy learners using aided language systems.  Our partnership also developed \nan information prescription on complex communication for families and care providers to access vetted \nresources and first-hand accounts from children, families and care providers working through complex \ncommunication challenges.   \nWhile research suggests the role of the teacher is critical in the educational success of students with \ncomplex communications needs, we know t collaborative approach is well received by children and \nyouth, families and their ‘wrap around team’ members.  In Alberta, speech and language services in \nschools are primarily consultative in nature, leaving the teacher and educational assistants to implement \nnot only educational supports for students with complex learning needs, but also augmentative and \nalternative communication (ACC) devices and supports. \nWe are continually exploring ways to build system capacity and sharing opportunities with our partners, \nand are very interested in the development of a distance education certificate program that could be \nmade available to all of our partners.  Such an approach supports our collaborative approach in working \nwith our children and youth as they learn to communicate with family, peers, and teachers in class, \ncommunity and home environments. \nASC - Nov 17, 2016 - Item 15 - page 31\nmailto:rauno.parrila@ualberta.ca\nBeing able to access this specialized curriculum online will be well received by our partners who are \noften separated by geography, program, system, and schedule.  We look forward to being able to access \nand promote this wonderful opportunity in the near future. \nSincerely, \nJanice K.

Post-Secondary Learning Act (PSLA): The PSLA gives GFC \nresponsibility, subject to the authority of the Board of Governors, over \nacademic affairs (Section 26(1)). Further, the PSLA gives the Board of \nGovernors authority over certain admission requirements and rules \nrespecting enrolment (Section 60(1)(c) and (d)). The Board has \ndelegated its authority over admissions requirements and rules \nrespecting enrolment to GFC. GFC has thus established an Academic \nStandards Committee (ASC). \n2. PSLA: The PSLA gives Faculty Councils power to “provide for the \nadmission of students to the faculty” (29(1)(c)). \n3. UAPPOL Admissions Policy: “Admission to the University of Alberta \nis based on documented academic criteria established by individual \nFaculties and approved by GFC. This criteria may be defined in areas \nsuch as subject requirements, minimum entrance averages, and \nlanguage proficiency requirements. In addition to academic requirements \nfor admission, GFC authorizes each Faculty to establish such other \nreasonable criteria for admission of applicants as the Faculty may \nconsider appropriate to its programs of study, subject to the approval of \nGFC (e.g. interview, audition, portfolio, etc.) \nThe admission requirements for any Faculty will be those approved by \nGFC as set forth in the current edition of the University Calendar. In \naddition to the admission requirements, selection criteria for quota \nprograms, where they exist, will also be published in the current edition \nof the University Calendar. The responsibility for admission decisions will \nbe vested in the Faculty Admission Committees or in the Deans of the \nrespective Faculties, as the councils of such Faculties will determine.” \n4. UAPPOL Admissions Procedure: \n“PROCEDURE \n1. EFFECTIVE DATE OF CHANGES TO ADMISSION REGULATIONS \nFollowing approval by GFC: \na. Where changes to admission regulations may disadvantage students \nin the current admission cycle, normally implementation will be effective \nafter the change has been published in the University Calendar for one \nfull year (i.e., effective the second year that the information is published \nin the University Calendar). \nASC - Nov 17, 2016 - Item 16 - page 2\nItem No. 16 \nGFC ACADEMIC STANDARDS COMMITTEE \nFor the Meeting of November 17, 2016 \nFor example, a change approved in May 2005 would be first published in \nthe 2006-2007 University Calendar in March 2006. Therefore the \nstatement cannot come into effect until September 2007 (affecting \napplicants who apply for the September 2007 term beginning July 2006). \nb. Where changes to admission regulations are deemed by the \napproving body to be ‘advantageous to students’, normally the date of \nimplementation will be effective immediately or at the next available \nintake for the admitting Faculty.” \n5. PSLA: The PSLA gives Faculty Councils the authority to “determine \nthe conditions under which a student must withdraw from or may \ncontinue the student’s program of studies in a faculty” (Section 29(1)(d)). \n6.
