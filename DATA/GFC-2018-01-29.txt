Discussion: Members commented on the diversity of experiences between Faculties, how experiential learning is integral to some programs, and how it looks different in every Faculty. It was recognized that it would therefore be difficult to have a single definition. Members also discussed: how to value communication, networking and personal skills rather than only technical skills; whether experiential learning should be embedded/recognized as course work; how to make access to international experiences as equitable as possible when cost could be a barrier; the role of student groups in providing experiences; how it should be a place where fundamental learning meets practical experience; the need to reflect on the experience as part of the learning; and recognition of prior learning. Regarding engagement with departments, Dr Forgie noted that the Deans have been asked to identify champions of different types of experiential learning. The Chair thanked members for their comments and invited them to contact Dr Forgie directly with further comments and suggestions.",

            "Description": "Purpose of the Proposal: The purpose of the draft document is to give GFC the opportunity to provide feedback on recommendations for the future direction of PLLC. Materials before members are contained in the official meeting file. The Chair noted the opportunity for the Peter Lougheed Leadership College (PLLC) to evolve into an umbrella leadership institution and allow the university to build a leadership brand. He referred to the recommendations provided which map out a strategy for the PLLC going forward. Discussion: There was a discussion on the cost of residence; it was noted that the requests for 2018-19 far exceed the available spaces. It was also noted that the new principal will look at ways to ensure that the space is being used effectively and also the availability of forum space for students. A member supported the recommendations and requested a graduate student be included on the selection committee. Regarding the certificate, it was noted that it would continue but changes could proposed in the future.",

DRAFT Recommendations for PLLC Future Direction \nPrepared by: Catherine Swindlehurst, Chief of Staff, Office of the President  \nGENERAL FACULTIES COUNCIL \nFor the Meeting of January 29, 2018 \nItem 9.1 \nQuestion from GFC Member Kyle Foster (submitted by email on January 11, 2018) \nTo the sub-committees of the GFC, \nReforming and understanding policy for the GFC and its standing committees is forefront for the \nGFC’s ad hoc committee.   Inquiries on the composition of each standing committee have been \nasked, and while the subject has been addressed, full and clear statements on the rationale \nbehind the composition have not been given. \nWhat is the sub-committee’s rationale for the composition? How does the current sub-\ncommittee’s composition align with the ad hoc committee’s recommendations? If the sub-\ncommittee has yet to discuss its composition, what recommendations will the sub-committee \nfollow to determine composition? \n----  \nResponse from President and Chair, General Faculties Council  \nIn April 2017, General Faculties Council approved the following documents proposed by the ad \nhoc Committee on Academic Governance including Delegated Authority: \n Principles of Delegated Authority \n Principles of Committee Composition, and  \n Roles and Responsibilities of Members \nThese documents continue to guide the implementation of the recommendations contained in \nthe ad hoc committee’s report endorsed by GFC in April 2017. The GFC Executive Committee \nestablished a transition committee to advise and guide the implementation of the \nrecommendations to be completed on or before April 2019.  \nOne set of recommendations calls for revisions to the terms of reference of the GFC standing \ncommittees. These committees are currently in various stages of this review and this process \nwill continue over the next year.  \nThe transition committee is currently working on a strategy to assist committees in their \napproach to the review of their terms of reference which will focus discussion on areas of \nresponsibility and delegated authority to ensure that each committee is fulfilling its \nresponsibilities to GFC. This will be followed by a review of committee composition which will \nreflect the Principles of Committee Composition and Roles and Responsibilities of Members \napproved by GFC.  Depending on the nature of the committee, there may be some instances \nwhere the work of the committee dictates variations to these principles; in such cases, the \ncommittee will come forward with an explanation on the need for the proposed membership. \nhttp://www.governance.ualberta.ca/~/media/Governance/Documents/GO05/GEN/Linked%20Documents%20on%20GFC%20Home%20Page/Principles_for_Delegation_of_Authority.pdf\nhttp://www.governance.ualberta.ca/~/media/Governance/Documents/GO05/GEN/Linked%20Documents%20on%20GFC%20Home%20Page/Principles_of_Committee_Composition.pdf\nhttp://www.governance.ualberta.ca/~/media/Governance/Documents/GO05/GEN/Linked%20Documents%20on%20GFC%20Home%20Page/Roles_and_Responsibilities_of_Members.pdf\nThe transition committee is currently developing some targeted questions to assist committees \nwith this discussion. \nThe questions regarding committee composition raised by a member of GFC at the October \nmeeting highlighted the importance of ensuring there is clear rationale regarding committee \ncomposition, and this rationale will be included with the proposals for revised terms of reference \nwhich will come before GFC for discussion and approval.  For the terms of reference approved \nby GFC in October 2017, these committees will also receive the transition committee questions \non committee composition to reconsider their membership. \nThe transition committee will be reporting at the February 26, 2018 GFC meeting on the status \nof the ad hoc committee recommendations and will, at that time, provide more details about \nguiding questions on committee composition. \nItem No. 10 \nGENERAL FACULTIES COUNCIL \nFor the Meeting of January 29, 2018 \nGeneral Faculties Council Standing Committee Report \nGFC Executive Committee  \n1.

This was done to ensure\nproper environmental conditions were being met\nfor the long-term conservation of the collection.\n• A storage reorganization project for the University\nof Alberta Art Collection stored at University Terrace\nbegan in June 2017 and will continue. The project\nwill involve an inventory of the collection,\ndigitization of works of art, and creation of\naccessible storage for art placement candidates.\n• There was a significant incident in the Vascular Plant\nHerbarium involving a burst pipe. Although there\nwas minimal short-term damage to the collection,\nthe heat and humidity caused by the burst pipe\ncould have long-term consequences for the\ncollection.
