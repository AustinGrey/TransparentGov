The University of Alberta gives a national and international voice to \ninnovation in our province, taking a lead role in placing Canada at the global forefront. \nValues \nThe University of Alberta community of students, faculty, staff, and alumni rely on shared, deeply held values \nthat guide behaviour and actions. These values are drawn from the principles on which the University of \nAlberta was founded in 1908 and reflect a dynamic, modern institution of higher learning, leading change \nnationally and internationally. \nAbove all, we value intellectual integrity, freedom of inquiry and expression, and the equality and \ndignity of all persons as the foundation of ethical conduct in research, teaching, learning, and service. \nWe value excellence in teaching, research, and creative activity that enriches learning experiences, advances \nknowledge, inspires engaged citizenship, and promotes the public good. \nWe value learners at all stages of life and strive to provide an intellectually rewarding educational \nenvironment for all. \nWe value academic freedom and institutional autonomy as fundamental to open inquiry and the pursuit of \ntruth. \nWe value diversity, inclusivity, and equity across and among our people, campuses, and disciplines. \nWe value creativity and innovation from the genesis of ideas through to the dissemination of knowledge. \nWe value the history and traditions of our university, celebrating with pride our people, achievements, and \ncontributions to society.  \nI N S T I T U T I O N A L  S T R A T E G I C  P L A N  -  M A Y  2 0 1 6   \n5 \nD\nR\nA\nF\nT\nAt the University of Alberta, we begin with people—people with ideas, talent, and \npurpose. Then, we act. \nWe seek knowledge. We educate citizens. We ask the big questions. We push the limits of human \nunderstanding and knowledge. We engage with partners and communities close to home and around the \nworld to lead positive change. We empower creative people to take risks and make imaginative leaps towards \nas yet undetermined futures. \nWhy? The answer is simple: We are a public university acting for the public good. \nWhen we act, we provide meaningful educational experiences, promote innovative thinking, and develop \noriginal and compelling solutions that matter. When we lead, we tackle the most important local, national, and \nglobal challenges. When we excel, our work sparks and feeds widespread social, cultural, and economic \nbenefits for others—indeed for the uplifting of the whole people. \nIn For the Public Good—our institutional strategic plan for the coming decade—we embrace and affirm our \nvision to inspire the human spirit through outstanding achievements in learning, discovery, and citizenship in a \ncreative community, building one of the world’s great universities for the public good. \nWe forge ahead, motivated and supported by the University of Alberta’s 108-year history of leadership, \nachievement, and public service. Inspired by this plan, we will strive to achieve the following strategic goals: \nBUILD a diverse, inclusive community of exceptional students, faculty, and staff from \nAlberta, Canada, and the world. \nEXPERIENCE diverse and rewarding learning opportunities that inspire us, nurture \nour talents, expand our knowledge and skills, and enable our success.  \nEXCEL as individuals, and together, sustain a culture that fosters and champions \ndistinction and distinctiveness in teaching, learning, research, and service. \nENGAGE communities across campuses, city and region, province, nation, and the \nworld to create reciprocal, mutually beneficial learning experiences, research projects, \npartnerships, and collaborations. \nSUSTAIN our people, our work, and the environment by attracting and stewarding the \nresources we need to deliver excellence to the benefit of all. \nIn pursuit of these shared goals, the University of Alberta will deepen our dedication to excellence and extend \nour record of public leadership, playing a lead role in building a better province, a better Canada, and a better \nworld. \nI N S T I T U T I O N A L  S T R A T E G I C  P L A N  -  M A Y  2 0 1 6   \n6 \nD\nR\nA\nF\nT\nThe University of Alberta is the province’s leading educator, generator of new ideas, and engine of social, \ncultural, and economic prosperity.

Thank you for your engagement, advice, \nand feedback throughout the months of consultation and preparation of the document. \nAs a community, we have developed one long-term, multi-layered plan to guide the overall decision-\nmaking and governance processes of the University of Alberta. Some of the goals, objectives and \nstrategies envisioned here can be implemented immediately; others will unfold over the course of the \nnext decade. We anticipate the need for an in-depth review in year five. \nAt the highest level, “For the Public Good” is meant to empower and enable each member of the \nUniversity of Alberta to build, experience, excel, engage, and sustain. The successful implementation of \nthe plan will depend on all of us, individually and collectively, taking action. \nFollowing approval of “For the Public Good,” we will have three immediate tasks. \nThe first will be to determine priorities for the short, medium, and long-term. The president and \nprovost will lead this process and assign responsibility for specific goals at the institutional level. At the \nsame time, leaders across the university will begin to develop, or continue to work towards, parallel \nstrategic priorities and objectives that flow from the plan for specific faculties, departments, and units.  \nThe second will be to develop an equitable, meaningful, and relevant set of qualitative and \nquantitative measures by which we will monitor our progress and success on an annual basis over \nthe coming years. These measures will be determined by the president and provost in consultation with \nthe Institutional Strategic Planning Advisory Committee, Board of Governors, vice-presidents and \ndeans, General Faculties Council, and other key stakeholders across the university. \nThe third will be to create a transparent, effective, and sustainable annual institutional reporting \nprocess to ensure that we hold ourselves accountable to the plan at all levels of the university. As the \ntitle of this plan suggests, we must also develop avenues for internal and external communication of the \nuniversity’s annual progress to demonstrate in detailed, concrete ways how we, as a public university, \nare indeed acting for the public good. \nOnce the plan is approved, we will continue to communicate frequently on the progress and outcomes \nof these initial steps.  \nDavid H.

All material \neconomic, environmental or fiscal implications of which we are aware have been considered in \nthe preparation of this report.  \nMichael Phair \nChair, Board of Governors \n5 \nMessage from the President \nThe past year at the University of Alberta has been marked by transition, reflection, \nengagement, and renewal. On July 1, 2015, I assumed the presidency of the university, \nfollowing a decade of exceptional leadership from President-Emeritus Indira Samarasekera. \nUnder her leadership, the University of Alberta grew in national and international prestige and \ninfluence, inspired by a bold, global vision outlined in the university’s 2005-2015 strategic plan, \nDare to Discover, and supported by an outstanding record of excellence in teaching, research, \nand service. As the success of Dare to Discover demonstrates, a university’s strategic plan is \nthe single most powerful tool for building a shared vision, enabling co-ordinated efforts, and \nmaximizing finite resources.  \nOver the last six months, Provost and Vice-President (Academic) Steven Dew and I have \nengaged the faculty, staff, and students of the University of Alberta in a critical period of \ninstitutional strategic planning to develop a new set of goals to guide us throughout the coming \ndecade. We recognize that the University of Alberta, like universities around the world, faces \nreal and significant challenges. Globalization, demographic and generational shifts in student \nand faculty populations, technological change in every arena, and highly mobile human \nresources are some of the key factors shaping the evolution of universities and their core \nmission of research and teaching. Universities are also affected by major economic and political \nforces, such as recent global declines in oil and gas prices.  \nAs we look to the future, we are convinced that the opportunities for positive change are far \ngreater for the University of Alberta than for many other universities across Canada and the \nworld. We sit at the centre of the province’s Campus Alberta and Edmonton’s City of Learners \nand are working with our post-secondary partners to provide Albertans with multiple integrated \npathways to achieve their educational goals and aspirations. We are home to talented faculty \nwith proven excellence in teaching and research, who are leading major research projects of \nlocal, national, and global significance. We continue to attract increasing amounts of external \nresearch funding and philanthropic support due to improved internal supports and systems. \nMost importantly, we are well supported by a provincial government committed to ensuring \nAlbertans have access to post-secondary institutions of the highest quality. \nThe Government of Alberta’s renewal of this support with the introduction of Bill 3 in June 2015 \nhas provided the critical funding we need to put future institutional strategic plans in action, \nparticularly in terms of attracting and hiring new faculty members which is always the first, \nessential step toward enriching student experience, increasing quality in teaching, learning, and \nresearch, as well as ensuring access for qualified students.  \nLooking to the future, we believe that we must and can diversify the U of A’s student population, \nattracting students from all over Canada and from traditionally underserved populations \nincluding First Nations, Métis, and Inuit peoples. We aim to deepen our engagement with \ndiverse partners to conduct and translate learning and research into evidence-based public \npolicy, improved industrial practices, changed attitudes, and healthier, more compassionate \ncommunities. And, we will continue to build multi-level, cross-sectoral national and international \npartnerships with high-ranking universities and institutions across Canada and the world. \n6 \nAlberta’s wealth in both people and natural resources, combined with its desire for social, \ncultural, economic, and environmental innovation and diversification, mean that in partnership \nwith the province the University of Alberta is set to play a major role in the fundamental \nreshaping of this province—and in doing so, to build a stronger, better, more compassionate \nand prosperous Canada.  \nDavid H. Turpin, CM, PhD, LLD, FRSC \nPresident and Vice-Chancellor \n7 \nThe University in 2015-16 \nThe University of Alberta remains an essential partner in achieving a prosperous future for the \nprovince through the education and training of the next generation of dynamic scientists, \nbusiness owners, social scientists, policy-makers, musicians, artists and volunteers. The U of A \nis now in the process of charting its course for the coming years with a revitalized Institutional \nStrategic Plan that will help our university meet the needs of the province and the nation in \nforging a thriving civic culture and a more productive and equitable society.  \nAlberta is facing challenging times, unlike anything we have seen in decades. With an \nunprecedented drop in the price of oil, it is becoming increasingly clear that diversifying the \nprovincial economy—and investing in knowledge and innovation to help us get there—is the \nbest strategy for avoiding the worst ramifications of the unpredictable boom-and-bust cycle.  \nFuture success will depend on Alberta’s ability to continue to develop top talent, to attract and \nretain world-class leaders and visionaries across disciplines, to advance the province as a \nglobal economic leader, to foster an innovative and entrepreneurial society and to encourage a \nthriving creative culture.  \nWithin a highly competitive global environment, the university this year continued to be \nrecognized for research excellence, ranking among the top 100 universities in the world and \nfourth in Canada on the QS World University Rankings for 2015-16. A breakdown of those \nrankings by subject places the U of A among the world’s top 50 in nursing (fourth), pharmacy \nand pharmacology (32), education (41), anthropology (42), mining engineering (44) and English \nlanguage and literature (50). Over the last decade, U of A researchers have attracted total \nsponsored research funding in excess of $4.6 billion (averaging more than $400 million per \nyear), putting the U of A fourth among Canada’s research-intensive universities. In both 2009–\n2010 and 2012–2013 (the most recent years in which complete data are available), the U of A \nhas ranked third in the U15 for sponsored research income per full-time teaching faculty – these \nfigures reflect the U of A’s status as a pre-eminent research university within Canada and \ninternationally. \nThe post-secondary environment continues to undergo significant changes, however, and the \npast year saw the university continue to innovate in response to evolving demands. Teaching \nand learning practices have continued to shift away from traditional lecture-style presentations \nto a greater breadth of learner styles and more opportunities to co-create and engage with \nknowledge by focusing on emerging technologies to reach beyond classrooms and to enhance \nclassroom activities. The university embraces innovation in both research and teaching – for \nexample, the new Donadeo Innovation Centre for Engineering, which celebrated its grand \nopening in June 2015, brings students and faculty from all engineering disciplines together into \nan exceptional space for collaboration and learning. University-wide, the U of A continues to \nlead all Canadian institutions with 41 academic staff who have received national 3M Teaching \nFellowships, Canada’s highest award for undergraduate university teaching.   \nThe university also strives to attend to its greater mission to transform society and culture by \nensuring all content respects Indigeneity, equity and diversity. The university is focused on \nrecruiting and welcoming a more diverse student body, and by reducing barriers to access for \ntraditionally under-represented groups, is contributing to addressing Alberta’s historically low \n8 \nrate of participation in post-secondary education. To support these goals, and to enrich the \noverall student experience, the U of A has made major investments in residence capacity; \nprojects underway in 2015-16 will, when completed, add over 900 residence spaces and \nposition the U of A to welcome more students from across Canada and the world.      \nThe university also recognizes the critical importance of a sustained and powerful response to \nthe findings of the national Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC). This year saw the \nopening of Wahkohtowin Lodge on Augustana Campus, a venue that offers a welcoming space \nfor students and community while honouring traditional territories providing opportunities for \nnon-Indigenous students to learn more about Indigenous people and cultures.   \nMore broadly, the university is committed to enhancing the communities in which it operates, as \nwell as the communities with which it engages, both near and far. Through programs like \nCommunity Service-Learning (CSL), the U of A is providing students with opportunities to work \nand have a direct impact on the local community – last year, over 1500 students were registered \nin a course with a CSL component, working with over 180 different community partners. And \nthrough ventures like TEC Edmonton, named by UBI Global as the 16th best business incubator \nin the world in 2015, the U of A is helping to ensure that university research benefits the Alberta \neconomy – TEC Edmonton’s clients have generated more than $470 million in the last five \nyears. \nTo support its mission, the university is committed to fiscal sustainability, and has continued to \npursue steps that include but are not limited to growing its endowment, generating new net \nrevenues, increasing federal government support for the indirect costs of research and \nleveraging the establishment of its land trust.  \nIn every aspect of its mandate, the U of A is a partner in social, cultural, and economic \ndevelopment, fostering and establishing the provincial, national, and international connections \nand understandings that support leading global enterprise and citizenship for Albertans. It’s all \npart of meeting Alberta’s changing needs and ensuring that the province remains a vital part of \nthe national knowledge economy. The university remains steadfastly committed to partnership \nwith the Government of Alberta to explore opportunities for growth, continued diversification of \nAlberta’s economy and leadership in serving the province of Alberta. \n9 \nSummary Statistics \nTable 2.

Of 89 disclosures received during the 2015-16 fiscal year, one qualified as \na public interest disclosure under the Public Interest Disclosure (Whistleblower Protection) Act. \nA formal investigation was conducted and found insufficient support for a finding of wrongdoing. \nMoreover, some issues were not within the university’s purview to investigate. The disclosing \nindividual was referred to the appropriate federal body. \n10 \nGoals, Priority Initiatives, Expected \nOutcomes and Performance \nMeasures \nThe 2015-16 Annual Report is transitional in nature as the University of Alberta is in the midst of \nan institutional strategic planning process, the aim of which is to develop a plan that reflects \ncommon values and a collective vision of what the university aspires to be. Together, the \nuniversity community is establishing new goals and strategies that will support the university’s \nvision and provide direction that both responds to and takes advantage of changing external \nand internal environments. In the years ahead, the university will look to this strategic plan to \nguide all institutional academic and administrative priority-setting, decision-making and \ngovernance. As always, the principles of access and quality resonate throughout the university’s \nactivities. \nThe university is focused on six key priorities as outlined in the transitional 2016 Comprehensive \nInstitutional Plan (CIP): \n• Faculty renewal \n• Student experience \n• Teaching and learning \n• Research excellence \n• Community engagement  \n• Infrastructure \nIn the CIP, the university has identified priority initiatives, expected outcomes and performance \nmeasures associated with each of these goals.  \nTo reflect current institutional priorities, this year’s Annual Report is organized around these \ngoals and performance measures. Since these goals were defined during the past year, the \nmeasures provided below report the current state and trends related to these priorities, rather \nthan progress toward achieving priority initiatives and expected outcomes. Next year, the U of A \nwill be in a position to report on progress made towards achieving the goals outlined in the \nstrategic planning process.  \n11 \nFACULTY RENEWAL \nAs noted in the 2016 CIP, there is a need to address the low number of assistant \nprofessors. These new professors play a critical role in the academy by bringing with \nthem vibrant perspectives and contributing to the university’s teaching and innovative \nresearch capacity. This deficit has been created by reduced hiring after a series of \nchallenges within the university’s base operating budget. Identifying, recruiting and \nsupporting the next generation of faculty is critical. Success will be influenced by social, \nintellectual and physical supports such as social forums and gathering places, critical \nmasses of scholars to support the development of strong ideas and new and \nmodernized infrastructure including spaces, labs and classrooms. \nHIGHLIGHTS \n• Famed virologist Lorne Tyrrell was named the winner of the 2015 Killam Prize for Health \nSciences. Just five Killam prizes of $100,000 are awarded annually by the Canada \nCouncil for the Arts’ Killam Program, in support of scholars of exceptional ability \nengaged in research projects of outstanding merit. In 1988, Tyrrell, now the director of \nthe Li Ka Shing Institute of Virology, along with chemistry researcher Morris Robins, \ndeveloped the first antiviral agent for hepatitis B, which led to one of the largest industry \ncollaborations (Glaxo Canada) with a Canadian university, resulting in the licensing of \nlamivudine. \n• World-renowned food researcher Feral Temelli is leading a UAlberta team in a new \npartnership with France's Innovation Fluides Supercritiques, building collaborations and \nindustry connections to advance the application of “supercritical fluids” – substances with \nproperties similar to both liquids and gases – for crop processing and oilsands uses. \n• Seeking expert advice on innovation and economic diversification, the Alberta \ngovernment called on Joseph Doucet, dean of the Alberta School of Business, to chair \nthe new Premier’s Advisory Committee on the Economy.  \nTable 3.

During \nthe celebration, Turpin announced the U of A’s intention to build the Maskwa House of \nLearning on North Campus to create a culturally relevant and inclusive environment for \nIndigenous students. He also announced that, beginning in September, every first-year \nstudent accepted to the U of A will be guaranteed a spot in residence. Studies show that \nliving in residence leads to higher levels of academic success, retention and participation \nin campus life. \n• Andrew Leach, an energy and environmental economist in the Alberta School of \nBusiness, is leading a panel tasked with formulating a new climate change policy for the \nprovince. \nTable 4.

The \nuniversity must foster a welcoming and supportive environment respectful of \nIndigeneity, equity and diversity. To succeed, students must understand they are \nessential members of the university community and must see the university as a \nnecessary and relevant stepping stone towards engagement with the rest of the world. \nExperiential learning (e.g. research opportunities, co-op and internship programs or \ninternational experiences) positions students strongly for future career opportunities, \nand students require facilities that allow them to feel comfortable and that promote \nengagement with people, ideas and learning supports. As such, the university is \nfocused on recruiting a more diverse student body and creating programs and spaces \nsuch as the Maskwa House of Learning on North Campus, as well as refreshed science \nlabs at Augustana Campus, that support and welcome Indigenous, rural students to \npursue advanced degrees.  \nHIGHLIGHTS \n• The U of A continues to lead the country in Academic All- Canadians—student-athletes \nwho have maintained an average of 80 per cent or better—thanks to 142 more this year. \nThe U of A’s all-time total increases to 2,461, the most in Canada. For All-Canadian \nSarah Farley, a co-op student in the third year of the civil and environmental engineering \nprogram, nothing could be better than a schedule that blends academics and athletics – \nshe managed to blend a co-op placement with at the Diavik Diamond Mine in the \nNorthwest Territories with a spot on the Pandas rugby team. \n• In 2015, the Golden Bears hockey team repeated as CIS champions and in doing so \nsecured the program’s 15th national title. As well, the Pandas and Bears curlers swept \naway all comers, with their first and second national titles, respectively. \nTable 7.

The U of A remains committed to attracting outstanding \nundergraduate and graduate students, post-doctoral fellows, and professors from Alberta, \nacross Canada, and abroad. Our academy represents Canada’s and Alberta’s cultural diversity \nand is an inclusive community that values its founding Indigenous people, minorities and rural \nand northern communities. Along with an exceptional and highly skilled technical and \nprofessional staff, these individuals create an integrated environment of teaching, learning, \nresearch and creative activities. They enable the breadth and quality that characterizes the \nuniversity’s public and private partnerships in Alberta, its participation in national consortia and \ninitiatives and its collaborations with top-tier international institutions and agencies. \nAccess to programs at the U of A evolves in response to student demand, workforce needs, and \nnew fiscal resources or constraints. In 2015-16, total enrollment across undergraduate and \ngraduate programs was 34,643 Full-Load Equivalents (FLE), exceeding the enrolment plan \ntarget of 33,129 FLE. This difference is accounted for by higher-than-expected graduate \nenrolments at the Master’s and especially doctoral levels. International students made up \n19.29% of total enrolments.   \n19 \n Table 12.

Teaching and learning practices have shifted \naway from traditional lecture-style presentations to embrace a greater breadth of learner \nstyles and more opportunities to co-create and engage with knowledge, leveraging \nemerging technologies to reach beyond classrooms and to enhance classroom \nactivities. The university endeavours to embrace these shifts and to better support \nprofessors and future professors who want to change the way they teach— to provide \nteaching supports and skill development and to provide better physical spaces and \ntechnological systems that permit innovative teaching, learning and assessment.  \nHIGHLIGHTS \n• The U of A welcomed nearly 39,000 students back to school Sept. 1 to begin the \nschool’s 107th year of classes. Although about 68% of students call Alberta home, the U \nof A population includes almost 4,200 students from every province and three territories \nin Canada, and an international contingent from 146 countries. \n• The Centre for Teaching and Learning, an on-campus resource that provides tools and \nresources to help teachers innovate and excel, offered dozens of workshops for faculty \non students on such diverse topics as blended learning, student engagement and \nmeasuring learning outcomes. \nTable 13.

Examples of each of these sessions would include Resume Writing, \nConflict Resolution, StartUp U, Time Management, and Working in a Team.  \n24 \nRESEARCH EXCELLENCE \nResearch drives innovative developments leading to economic growth and prosperity in \nour society. As the leading research-intensive institution in Alberta, and one of the top \nfive in Canada, the U of A has a particular responsibility to ensure that its people and \nthe materials and resources they need—such as labs, IT infrastructure and supports, \nlibraries and access to communities—are of the highest quality possible. The research \nworld has shifted to team-based explorations and approaches to discovery that are \nmore multidisciplinary in nature and globally relevant. The university competes \nnationally and internationally for the best researchers, as well as for the top funding \nsources to support research activities. To recruit exceptional researchers and to support \nthem in producing the highest-calibre outcomes, ranging from fundamental knowledge \ncreation to new applied technologies, and including the training of scholars and \nprofessionals, attention and resources must be devoted to research facilities and \ndefining (and then pursuing) research excellence in a shifting context. This requires \nintellectual and physical supports including new hires, research assistants, \ninfrastructure and specifically targeted development and investment in partnerships with \ncommunities, industries, and other countries.  \nThe university offers research and doctoral programs across seven thematic areas: humanities \nand fine arts, social structure and systems, science and technology, energy, environment, food \nand bio-resources and health and wellness. This full spectrum of inquiry positions the U of A’s \nacademy and its graduates to make the comprehensive contributions towards scientific, social, \nand cultural innovations needed to support the goals Alberta has set for itself: effective resource \nand environmental management, a broadened economic base and resilient and healthy \nindividuals and communities.  \nOver 200 graduate programs, attended by 7,572 graduate students, and nearly 600 post-\ndoctoral trainees are all intricately entwined with the U of A’s learning, teaching, and discovery \nmandate. Individuals educated to the PhD level enable large-scale, visionary, and sometimes \nrisky research agendas. The Faculty of Graduate Studies and Research Professional \nDevelopment program advances research and develops professional skills and qualities sought \nby employers, making the U of A’s graduate students competitive in the global market for \ntraditional educational positions (e.g., professors), industry positions (e.g., industrial research \nand development) and within communities (e.g., government officials). \nGlobal Engagement  \nGlobal engagement is vital to high-quality research efforts. The development of multinational or \nglobal research networks expands institutional capacity to address complex global issues in a \nmore robust and efficient way. Creative solutions to complex problems can be readily shared \nacross communities and nations through collaborations with other academic organizations, \nbusinesses and industry, non-profits and government agencies. In 2015-16, the U of A has \nremained committed to sustaining and advancing strategic international partnerships of direct \nbenefit to Alberta that will: \n● foster the global exchange of talent and expertise \n● increase exposure to a diversity of thinking on global issues \n25 \n● enhance access to a wider variety of research infrastructure, knowledge, resources, \nstate-of-the-art equipment, and advanced techniques \nSignificant international research collaborations also emerge and are sustained at the unit, \nprogram, and faculty level. Key examples have been identified in table 18 below. \nHIGHLIGHTS \n• In early 2016, cell biology researcher Tom Hobman became one of the world’s first \nresearchers to begin trying to combat the Zika virus, a mosquito-borne virus linked to an \nexponential increase in reported cases of microcephaly, an often fatal congenital \ncondition associated with incomplete brain development in newborns. \n• Research by the U of A’s Stephanie Montesanti showed the connection between \ninterpersonal violence and social factors like education, income, housing and gender, \nsuggesting that the best strategies for preventing violence might be those that develop \nsafe housing, personal skills and employment assistance.  \n• In a world first, researchers in the Computer Poker Research Group essentially solved \nheads-up limit Texas hold ‘em poker with their program, called Cepheus. The discovery \nbuilds on the U of A’s renown in the application of AI to game-playing problems, \nhighlighted when U of A researchers solved checkers in 2007. \n• Research on new antennas and front-end circuits for 5G networks is underway at the U \nof A. Our researchers are also working on ways to wirelessly power remote sensors and \ndevelop a new type of 3-D printer capable of manufacturing electronic devices, sensors \nand antennas in one integrated process. \nHIGHLIGHTS \n• Early-stage research by neuroscience PhD student Shraddha Sapkota, along with \nfaculty in psychology and chemistry, shows that body fluids like saliva may help us \nunderstand the potential of developing Alzheimer’s, even among people not yet \nexhibiting related memory problems. The saliva technique shows promise for predicting \nand tracking cognitive decline and is a safe, easy, non-invasive and affordable \ndiagnostic tool. \n• Crop researcher Elzbieta Mietkiewska isolated genes from pomegranates and was able \nto incorporate them into high- value oilseed crops such as canola and flax. This process \nadds punicic acid, a polyunsaturated fatty acid that has been found to help slow the \ngrowth of cancer cells. \n• Thanks to the School of Public Health, Alberta has the clearest picture yet of the \nprevalence of addiction. Researchers found nearly one in 10 men and one in 20 women \nin the general Alberta population struggles with alcohol misuse, and one in five Albertans \ndeals with addictions that range from substance use and gambling to behavioural \naddictions. \nHIGHLIGHTS \n26 \n• A vaccination research team led by Lorne Babiuk, professor and Vice President \n(Research), was named as part of a $5M federal grant to test a heat-stable combination \nvaccine created to protect livestock against up to five deadly diseases that cause losses \nof up to 25 per cent in Africa’s livestock sector. \n• Using potato peels and culls, a U of A research team led by Marleny Aranda Saldaña \ncreated a starch- based bioactive film that is eco-friendly and rich in antioxidants, with \napplications for the food packaging and cosmetic industries. \n• A new study led by pediatrics professor Anita Kozyrskyj reveals infants with a fewer \nnumber of different bacteria in their guts at three months old are more likely to become \nsensitized to foods such as milk, eggs or peanuts by the time they are one year old. \nPM2 Prestigious national and international awards for faculty, post-doctoral fellows, and \ngraduate students2 \nTable 15.

Discoveries included rolling back the \nclock on snake evolution by nearly 70M years; a new species of a long-necked dinosaur \nfrom a skeleton found in China that lived 160M years ago; the oldest known crown-group \ntrue higher crab, which lived 110M years ago in the forest of Colombia; and evidence of \ndimorphism observed in a pair of oviraptors preserved side by side in Mongolia. \n• An international team of researchers, led by rehabilitation medicine professor Greg \nKawchuk, used MRI video to determine that the distinctive popping sound heard when \ncracking knuckles is caused by the rapid creation of a gas-filled cavity within the synovial \nfluid, a super-slippery substance that lubricates the joints. \n• U of A researchers have developed a new “under the skin” islet transplantation \ntechnique—an evolution of the U of A’s Edmonton Protocol developed in the late ‘90s \nthat temporarily enables severe Type 1 diabetics to stop taking insulin. The new \ntechnique offers less risk and greater patient benefit, and holds potential for regenerative \nmedicine beyond diabetes. \nHIGHLIGHTS \n• The federal government named the U of A home to the $27 million Canadian Glycomics \nNetwork (GlycoNet), one of four new Networks of Centres of Excellence. GlycoNet is a \nnational network of industry and academic partners, featuring 60 researchers at 22 \ninstitutions. The U of A has a strong history in cutting-edge carbohydrate research, \noffering potential treatments for conditions ranging from genetic diseases to influenza. \n• U of A cattle researchers are playing a leading role in a project that received $10.3 \nmillion to assemble the world’s largest database of cattle characteristics in an effort to \nincrease feed efficiency and reduce methane emissions in dairy cattle. The money \ncomes on the heels of a $9.8 million grant from government and industry to U of A swine \nresearchers to develop genomics tools to manage the nutritional content of pig feed to \nensure healthier pigs. \n• The U of A and the Mexican government signed an MOU that will act as the blueprint for \na $16 million partnership that promises to help Mexico improve its burgeoning \nhydrocarbon sector. This agreement comes amidst energy reforms that have seen \nMexico open its oil and gas sector after 75 years of state ownership. \nTable 18. PM3 Research consortia and partnerships formed with top-tier international \npartners: \nSpecific initiatives: \n● Germany: $3 million per year for five years to continue collaboration with the Helmholtz \nAssociation and the numerous partnerships this collaboration fosters. \n● China: $3 million per year for five years to foster linkages with Tsinghua University, one of the \n28 \nworld’s leading universities with particular expertise in the areas of energy and environment. \n● France: $1 million per year for five years to foster the France-Alberta Science and Technology \nInitiative (FAST). \nActivities Related to the university’s priority countries: \nChina \n• Tsinghua University - SCENEREI (Sino-Canada Energy and Environment Research and \nEducation Initiative): Funding was secured from the provincial government and leveraged through \nthe faculties of engineering, science, and business to support 24 joint research projects with \ncollaborators in China until January 31, 2017. \n• MOST (Ministry of Science and Technology): A proposal to Alberta Innovation and Advanced \nEducation for an additional $500,000 grant to pursue activities with China under the Joint \nResearch Labs program was approved, and the U of A was awarded the funding in March 2015. \nSome joint China-U of A projects have been identified and formal proposals for funding are \npending. \nGermany  \n• Helmholtz-Alberta Initiative (HAI): A five-year extension of the memorandum of understanding in \nHAI between the Helmholtz Association and the U of A was signed in September 2014. Areas of \nresearch focus in HAI include: \no Energy and Environment  \no Infectious Diseases  \no Neurodegenerative Diseases  \no Diabetes  \n• Fraunhofer Society: A Memorandum of Agreement was established between the Fraunhofer \nInstitute for Process Engineering and Packaging and the Fraunhofer Institute for Environmental, \nSafety, and Energy Technology in partnership with the U of A.  \n• Leibniz Association: Initiatives between the Leibniz Association and the U of A in the areas of \ndigital humanities (e.g., Science 2.0 and Citizen Sciences) and digital education are under \ndevelopment. \nActivities related to other countries: \nFrance  \n• FAST! (France-Alberta Science and Technology Initiative): The Office of the Vice President \n(Research), through the HAI team, worked closely with University of Alberta International and the \nFrench Embassy to facilitate a panel discussion on campus Oct. 29, 2015, with a focus on climate \nchange and energy transition. The event was part of a series of French Ameri-Can Climate TalkS \n(FACTS) across Canada and the United States in preparation for the UN-led COP21 climate \nconference that took place in Paris in December 2015. \nMexico \n• SENER (Mexican Ministry of Energy): Provost and Vice-president (Academic) Steven Dew signed \na letter of intent Dec. 4, 2015, with SENER. The Agreement focuses on facilitating work on \nhydrocarbons, and it is anticipated that this new collaboration will stimulate the exchange of \ngraduate students and professors working on topics of mutual interest, and possibly lead to joint \ncertificate or master's programs. \nIndia \n• IC-IMPACTS (India-Canada Centre for Innovative Multidisciplinary Partnerships to Accelerate \nCommunity Transformation and Sustainability): Now in its third year of operation, IC-IMPACTS \ncontinues to focus on change for local communities in both India and Canada. It currently has 158 \nresearchers involved, is training 327 highly qualified personnel and has funded 29 research \nprojects. The IC-IMPACTS innovative Summer Institute is an annual program that equips \n29 \nCanadian and Indian graduate students with skills in research, innovation, commercialization, and \nleadership. The 2016 Summer Institute will be held in Edmonton from May 29 to June 3, and will \nfocus on nanotechnology in the areas of infrastructure, water, and health. \nOther: \n• Worldwide Universities Network (WUN): The U of A joined this network of 18 research-intensive \ninstitutions across Europe, North America, Africa, Asia, and Oceania in 2008. WUN creates \nopportunities for international collaboration and gives the U of A an international voice in terms of \nits research strengths and contributions. \nSource: The Office of the Vice President (Research) \nHIGHLIGHTS \n• Paleontologists have discovered a new species of iguana in Southern Brazil that dates \nback 80M years and suggests ancient iguanas roamed throughout the single landmass \nof Pangaea before its final breakup. \n• A team of U of A researchers developed a natural supplement from the yolks of chicken \neggs containing antibodies that prevent the absorption of gliadin, a component of gluten \nthat triggers the autoimmune response in those with celiac disease. The product is being \ntested for its effect on treating the symptoms of celiac disease to offer more dietary \nfreedom and a better quality of life for people with both celiac disease and gluten \nintolerance. \n• A U of A psychologist worked out a mathematical theory of why certain nonsensical Dr. \nSeuss words like sneedle are funny. He gave his subjects a series of non-words and \ndiscovered the perception of humour was quantifiable: the weirder the word, the funnier \nits rating. \n• Sports medicine researchers found that while mixed martial arts (MMA) may be bloodier \nthan boxing, it is less dangerous – MMA fighters face a slightly higher risk of minor \ninjuries, whereas boxers are more likely to experience serious harm from concussions \nand other head trauma, loss of consciousness, eye injuries and broken bones. \nTable 19.

Researchers \nfound an increased number of species in the understory vegetation, an increased \namount of cover, a high abundance of the common lichens and tree diameter growth up \nto 30 per cent greater than it had been prior to the oilsands development. \n• The U of A will soon house Canada’s ice core collection—some dating as far back as \n800,000 years. A rich source of information on past climate change, ancient microbes, \npollutants and extreme weather events, the cores will play a key role in climate change \nscience at the U of A, nationally and globally. \n• A diamond research team found that ancient seawater was involved in forming \ndiamonds in Canada’s North. Last year the same researchers confirmed the presence of \nmassive amounts of water deep beneath the Earth’s surface, furthering theories that \nEarth’s transition zone may contain as much water as all the world’s oceans. \nTable 20.

The university strives to \nmaintain and expand connections with communities, increasing engagement and \nconsultation. This includes direct interaction such as meetings or events with community \nmembers and stakeholder groups, as well as the development of welcoming spaces \nand partnerships around facilities to enhance university integration with community \ngroups. The development of facilities, programming and, most important, relationships \nwill be priorities in this area. Interaction with industry provides expanded experiences for \nour students as they prepare to enter the workforce.  \nHIGHLIGHTS \n• In February of 2015, the province named former city councillor and community builder \nMichael Phair the new chair of the U of A board of governors. \n• The U of A announced aid for up to 10 Syrian students affected by the conflict in their \ncountry to study on campus through a new President’s Award for Refugees and \nDisplaced Persons. \n• This hockey season, a small team from Calder Bateman worked feverishly with the \nUniversity of Alberta’s Institute for Sexual Minority Studies and Services, or iSMSS, to \nbring Pride Tape from concept to reality. With a list of champions including Oilers captain \nAndrew Ference, Pride Tape is a badge of support from the hockey community to \nLGBTQ youth. A Kickstarter crowdfunding campaign will pay for the first 10,000 rolls and \nlead off a conversation about ending homophobia in sports.  \n• The U of A launched the Speakers’ Bureau in July 2015 to showcase its talented \nscholars to the community.  Bridging scholars to the community has demonstrated to \ncitizens the importance of post secondary education, research and its impacts on \npeople's daily lives. To date, hundreds of community members have been engaged with \nthe U of A’s researchers and scholars through speaking events at community gathering \nplaces as well as through a partnership with the Edmonton Public Library for an evening \nspeakers series. \nTable 21.

The engagement efforts in addition to surpassing the university's \ncampaign goals are a successful contribution to the success of the Capital Region \nCampaign. The university's active involvement with the United Way positions the \ninstitution as a major contributor to improving the lives of citizens in the city of \nEdmonton. \n• The Community Connections Awards demonstrate the deeply rooted connections \nbetween the U of A and the communities that we serve. This is the fourth year the \nawards are taking place. The Community Scholar Award recipients are Catherine Chan, \nPhD, and Rhonda Bell, PhD, professors in Human Nutrition in the Faculty of ALES for \ntheir work in creating The Pure Prairie Eating Plan to support those living with chronic \ndiseases.  \n• The U of A Community Leader Award went to the Sexual Orientation and Gender \nIdentity Advocacy Committee for creating an annual professional conference which \nbrings speakers and subject matter experts together to help understand issues \nexperienced by members of the LGBTQ community. Their advocacy work has been \ninstrumental in amending the medical school curriculum, fostering a new generation of \nhealth care professionals who are better informed and more sensitive to the barriers \nfaced by LGBTQ individuals \n33 \nINFRASTRUCTURE \nAs Alberta’s largest and oldest post-secondary institution, the U of A manages more \nthan 1.7 million square metres of complex facility inventory, ranging in age from more \nthan 100 years old to brand new. Existing facilities must be able to keep pace with the \nongoing teaching, research, and administrative needs of a changing campus community \nand expanding research mandate. There is also a need to ensure that the university has \nthe necessary infrastructure to support and foster continued enrolment growth and key \nfaculty recruitment. Continued research growth requires increasingly complex labs and \nequipment, and increased participation of under-represented populations. Among the \nuniversity’s capital priorities are maintaining and refurbishing older facilities, such as the \nhistoric Dentistry/Pharmacy building; constructing new academic buildings such as the \nTranslational Lab on North Campus and the new Science Lab at Augustana; creating \nnew and contemporary residence spaces to support more students with diverse needs; \ncreating buildings and spaces to address reconciliation responsibilities, such as the \nMaskwa House of Learning; and building facilities that enhance community \nengagement, such as the Edmonton Galleria Project and the Twin Arenas on South \nCampus.   \nMajor Funded Capital Projects  \nThe university made substantial progress in advancing its capital investment agenda in \n2015-16.  \nMajor projects completed in 2015-16 include: \n• Donadeo Innovation Centre for Engineering: This facility, which provides 28,400 \nsquare metres of space to support expanded educational and research activities in \nthe Faculty of Engineering, was completed in spring 2015 and fully occupied in \n2015-16. \n• Chemical Materials Engineering Building: Significant renewals were completed for \nthree floors, and the renewed space was reopened for occupancy. \nMajor projects underway in 2015-16 include: \n• Student housing: Residence projects underway will add a total of 962 beds to our \ninventory and will increase the university’s ability to provide housing to 18.1 per cent of \nfull-time students. These new residences will provide housing for faculty cohorts, and \nsupport the university’s goal of providing purpose-built housing for up to 25 per cent of \nits full-time student population. Residences are being developed through debt financing \nby the institution.  \no Peter Lougheed Hall: This residence expansion project will add 142 beds to our on-\ncampus housing inventory. The new residence will support the Peter Lougheed \nLeadership College, part of the larger Peter Lougheed Leadership Initiative between \nthe U of A and The Banff Centre, focused on leadership development of \nundergraduate students. Construction commenced in 2015-16. \n34 \no East Campus Village 9: This facility will accommodate up to 300 upper-year \nundergraduate students in four and six bedroom apartments. This new community \nfeatures fitness, social, study, project, and amenity spaces designed to enhance the \nstudent experience. Major planning work was completed in 2015-16 and the project \nis near construction-ready. \no Lister Hall Tower 5: This new community will accommodate up to 520 students \n(based on double occupancy) in a modern, dormitory-style community designed to \nenhance the experience of students in their first year. Major planning work was \ncompleted in 2015-16 and the project is near construction-ready. \n• Research and Collection Resource Facility (RCRF): This records repository project \ninvolves construction of a purpose-built facility of approximately 3,437 gross square \nmetres to house 5.1 million volumes (anticipated requirement to 2035) on South Campus \nwith easy access. The new facility will include all required environmental and retrieval \nsystems expected in a modern records depository and will be expandable to \naccommodate future needs. Construction commenced in 2015-16.  \n• Devonian Garden infrastructure: This project will update the gardens’ current aged and \nmissing infrastructure (roads, gas, power, and sewer) to a standard to facilitate the \nplanned development and increased visitorship to the garden.  \n• Devonian Garden Islamic Garden: In June 2009, His Highness the Aga Khan announced \nplans to create a traditional Islamic garden within the university’s Devonian Botanic \nGarden in recognition of the growing partnership between the university and the Aga \nKhan University. Design is advancing to facilitate the proposed garden and building \ninfrastructure and will be construction-ready in 2016. Together with other gardens on the \nDevonian Botanical Garden site, this space will provide learning and research space, \ncommunity outreach programs and visitor and tourism support. \nA complete summary of progress on funded and unfunded capital priorities is presented in \ntables 24 and 25. \nHIGHLIGHTS \n• The university’s District Energy System provides substantial savings in utility costs not \nonly to the university, but also to other taxpayer-funded institutions in the greater \ncampus area (GCA), such as the hospitals, the Jubilee Auditorium, Canadian Blood \nServices, Alberta government facilities, etc. Over the last five years, the university’s \npurchase prices for natural gas and power have been the lowest amongst the major \npost-secondary institutions in Alberta, averaging 25 per cent less for natural gas and 28 \nper cent less for power. \n• To support its District Energy Plan, the university has commenced replacement of aging \ninfrastructure in the heating plant while simultaneously providing a reliable supply of \nsteam and power to the greater campus area. This project began in 2014 and will be \ncompleted over seven-to-ten years. \n• Under the successful Energy Management Program, the university initiated a new series \nof energy projects for campus facilities, financed through borrowing and paid back \nthrough the resulting energy savings.  \n35 \n• The accumulated impact of our ongoing and significant investment in energy initiatives \nhas aided in reducing greenhouse gas emissions and lowering operating costs, and has \ncontributed significantly to the reduction of deferred maintenance liabilities. \nFigure 1. Impact of Energy Management Plan Measures on CO2 Emissions, 1990-2030 \nHIGHLIGHTS \n• Under the leadership of the Office of Sustainability, the university measures, tracks and \nreports on performance using the Sustainability Tracking, Assessment & Rating System \n(STARS™). The university achieved a Gold rating in 2014 (up from a Silver rating in \n2012) by increasing efforts across four categories: academics, engagement, operations, \nand planning and administration. \n• Through the University of Alberta Property Trust Inc., a wholly-owned subsidiary, the U \nof A is working to manage and develop university-owned lands and to raise dedicated, \npermanent funding to support the core mission of the university. The development of \ndesignated lands is also intended to contribute to the demand for high-quality, \nresidential, mixed-use in-fill developments, of vibrant, livable communities on the \nuniversity and in the city’s core.  \nHIGHLIGHTS \n• The university and the City of Edmonton have recently executed a Memorandum of \nUnderstanding to investigate and develop a new Twin Arenas facility that would meet \ncommon community and programming objectives, supported by sound business case \nprofiles and a rigorous community consultation process while addressing deferred \nmaintenance liabilities. \n36 \nFinancial Highlights \nTo be provided by Financial Services after approval of Financial Statements.\n37 \nInternationalization \nThe University of Alberta’s international collaborations create exceptional learning, discovery, \ncitizenship and innovation opportunities to advance the institutional vision of being one of the \nworld’s top publicly funded institutions for the benefit of our students and the province. \nGlobal Engagement \nU of A programs enhance perspectives on challenging global issues and promote cross-cultural \nunderstanding and communication skills. These experiences equip students with the necessary \nknowledge and skills to be successful in an increasingly global environment. Our student-\ncentred initiatives, which promote global engagement, include: \n• enhanced experiential, internship and co-op experiences in international settings \n(examples include the e3 program in Berlin, Brazil and Washington, as well as other \neducational and research abroad programs in more than 60 countries) \n• increased opportunities for U of A students to participate in shorter-duration international \nexperiences, either as an integral component of academic courses or independently \n(examples include the Alternative Reading Week program in the Faculty of Agricultural, \nLife & Environmental Sciences - ALES) \n• multiple formal joint and double degree programs with partner institutions from around \nthe world.  \nResearch \nThe university is a research-intensive institution with output that is recognized globally in diverse \ndisciplines. Through active, collaborative research with teams from all over the world, professors \nadvance knowledge, education and pedagogy in their respective disciplines. Global research \nengagement has many benefits to the U of A and the province, including leveraging funding \nresources and expertise from other parts of the globe to address challenges that affect \neveryone, including Albertans. The U of A is continuing to engage in high-quality, \nmultidisciplinary, multinational research projects in many parts of the globe, including: \n• strengthening existing strategic international partnerships with India, China, Germany, \nthe United States, and Brazil \n• fostering new, multi-disciplinary, multi-national research projects in diverse disciplines \nwith partner institutions from other countries \n• leveraging international funding agencies to secure resources to tackle emerging \nproblems in regions of interest.  \nDiversity \nThe presence of international students and foreign-trained experts broadens the perspective, \nimpact, and relevance of the U of A’s teaching, research, creative activities, and community \nservice work. International students who are educated at the U of A and remain in Alberta \nprovide the province with additional highly skilled, innovative, and entrepreneurial professionals. \nThey also bring cultural diversity together with global connections, insights and alternative \nperspectives on issues and challenges that better position the university, businesses and the \nprovince. The recruitment of exceptional undergraduate and graduate students from targeted \n38 \nhighly ranked foreign institutions advances the university’s academic enterprise and objectives. \nIn 2014–2015, approximately 14 per cent of our undergraduate population and 35 per cent of \nour graduate population were international students.  \nOff-Shore Program Delivery \nThe following table reports core metrics for off-shore program delivery, as per the provincial \nGuidelines for Off-Shore Delivery of Alberta Post-Secondary Programs and Training.  \nWhile this table includes all credential programs offered outside of Canada and joint/dual degree \nprograms with students currently registered, it under-represents the full scope of the university’s \ninternational educational activities. First, it does not include stand-alone courses or international \nco-op and experiential components of domestic programs. Second, it does not fully reflect joint \ndegree programs. In certain joint degree programs, students based at a foreign home university \nmay spend time at U of A as visiting students during the course of their program, often working \nwith a U of A faculty mentor, but may petition for joint degree status only as they prepare to \ngraduate. These students are not captured in the program enrolment data reported below.\n39 \nTable 22.

Core IT functionality for research includes data \nstorage and server and app hosting. \n• Support for access: offering enhanced systems and processes for undergraduate \nadmissions and graduate student scholarships and awards, including enrolment \nmanagement systems and an institutional data warehouse accessible by admissions \npersonnel across faculties. \n• Support for teaching and learning: increasing capacity to use digital technologies to \nenhance learning experiences on campus and for distance education, including support \nfor alternative delivery programs (such as the Master of Arts in Communications and \nTechnology), blended delivery, and other innovative delivery models (such as enabling \nsatellite course sites for courses in Rehabilitation Medicine).  \n• Support for efficiency and sustainability: enhancing the efficiency of administrative \nsystems, including performance reporting and data capture and monitoring of student \nprogress. \nIn support of these priorities, the university delivered the following major IT enhancements in \n2015-16: \n• successful deployment of a new graduate admissions system to three early-adopter \ndepartments, with full roll-out now underway \n• implementation of a new financial system for Olds College, enabling more timely and \naccurate year-end reporting and responding to concerns identified by the College and \nthe provincial Auditor \n• launch of the online university calendar \n• performance enhancements for the Electronic Documents and Records Management \nSystem, allowing the system to handle about 9,000 transcripts per day from the Alberta \nPost-Secondary Application System (up from 800) \n• implementation of changes to the PeopleSoft system to enable new Registrar initiatives  \n• enabling of anonymous IDs for publisher websites, allowing instructors to use assigned \nevaluation materials on publisher websites while preserving student privacy \n• support for Peter Lougheed Leadership College to deploy BlackBoard communities (an \nonline venue for hosting teaching and instructional materials) in the College’s first course \nofferings \n• transition of the U of A PeopleSoft environment to the IBM cloud, providing improved \nresilience and availability at the same cost \n43 \n• migration of the U of A moodle from the Kelowna RackForce data centre to the U of \nA/University of Calgary shared data centre, with live failover tested successfully \n• migration of classroom booking software, Ad Astra, to the Ad Astra private cloud, \nreducing infrastructure and support costs. \nOther major projects were initiated in 2015-16 and will be completed in 2016: \n• substantial upgrades to the PeopleSoft system supporting HR processes \n• implementation of a system for purchasing to be used across the university \n• implementation of a system for planning and budgeting to be used across the university. \n44 \nCapital Plan \nThe university’s Capital Plan endeavours to take a balanced approach in identifying the \nUniversity of Alberta’s planning, engineering, and construction needs. The university’s highest \nproject priorities support and are strategically linked to Comprehensive Institutional Plan goals, \nand have been identified as requiring additional funding support from the Alberta government. \nCritical projects are further refined to the following groups:  \n● new (or replacement) projects  \n● expansion projects  \n● preservation projects (> $5 million)  \n● minor preservation projects (< $5 million) \n● IT deferred maintenance  \n● health and Safety  \n● building system renewals \nFour Areas of Focus: \n1. Functional renewal and reduction in deferred maintenance liability: preserve \nexisting physical assets by addressing deferred maintenance and functional renewal that \nacknowledges the changes in research and teaching requirements.  \n2. Envelope funding for pre-design services: target planning dollars for priority projects, \nthereby ensuring well-defined project scope and budget accuracy. \n3. Student housing: provide purpose-built, supportive student housing for up to 25 per \ncent of full-time enrolment. \n4. New space: strategically plan and construct critical new facilities, respecting the varied \nneeds of the university’s five distinct campuses. \nThe following tables identify current capital priorities that address these areas of focus, \npresented in order of priority within each category (New, Expansion and Preservation).  \n45 \nTable 24.
