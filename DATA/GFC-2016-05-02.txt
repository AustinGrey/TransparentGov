            "Description": "Purpose of the Proposal: To provide General Faculties Council (GFC) with an update from the Academic Governance Working Group. To engage GFC in a discussion on the terms of reference of GFC with particular attention to “3. Mandate of the Committee”. GFC will be asked to consider: Are we living up to the principles of the Mandate? What is the desired level of clarity on delegated authority? Is current practice matching the Mandate? Are we striking a correct balance between full delegation and no delegation? Are appropriate matters being referred to full GFC from Standing Committees? Is this your vision of Academic Governance? Discussion: Dr Elliott reported that the Academic Governance Working Group had added a number of new members and had met several times since the March GFC meeting. He noted that the Working Group identified a number of operational improvements that had been implemented and initiated a process to review the Terms of Reference for each GFC Standing Committee. Dr Elliott provided an overview of GFC’s authority over academic affairs as articulated in the Post- Secondary Learning Act (PSLA) and spoke of the shared governance model utilized by the University. He then spoke on the principles of delegation. Dr van der Baan, as Chair of the GFC Nominating Committee, gave an overview of the processes used to fill GFC and GFC Standing Committee vacancies emphasizing that the Nominating Committee strives to ensure that there is a breadth of representation from across the University and that the interests and expertise of the applicants are considered. He pointed out that most of the Nominating Committee members also sit on the Executive Committee and hence a separate committee (Replenishment) is responsible for providing candidates to GFC in this instance. A member expressed concern that the process seems restricted to those members already involved and that creating a bank of names to fill vacancies limited the ability of members to serve on committees. Dr van der Baan acknowledged that the Terms of Reference in this regard are out of date with current practice and reiterated the commitment to broad representation on standing committees. Members engaged in a discussion of the mandate of GFC. Members raised the following issues: how are strong divisions within committees identified and brought forward; how much can GFC rely on Chair’s instinct to bring items forward; how does research fit in; technology enhanced participation should be available for online students to be able to participate in governance; GFC could benefit from seeing materials seen by the Academic Planning Committee (APC); GFC maintains the right to comment on anything of interest to the university. A question arose about revisions to the PSLA; the Provost noted that changes to the Act would likely be limited to those related to the new labour legislation. The Chair noted that although Chairs of GFC Standing Committees may play some part in setting the Agendas, most items come from other places. He emphasized that as Chair of GFC, he tries to ensure that GFC is engaged in big, strategic issues at the academy. A member suggested that the language within GFC’s Terms of Reference could be strengthened in this regard to clarify that GFC should be the body to review important academic issues. After a review of GFC’s specific powers under the PSLA, members commented on whether the list was reflective of current practices or whether changes to the delegations were necessary. Comments provided included: the intersection of operational and academic affairs merits additional review including such things as the decision to transition the Centre for Writers from the Faculty of Arts; and the issues of delegation are complex and require more time to consider. The Chair indicated that the work of unravelling past delegations is significant and thanked members of the Working Group and University Governance for their hard work in doing so for this meeting. Members discussed the delegated authorities of GFC’s Standing Committees and the balance of such delegations. On this point, the Chair noted that governance review is dependent on the contents of each proposal and that some items are approved by GFC while others must go forward to the Board of Governors. He reminded members that the Board of Governors retains ultimate authority over academic affairs of the University of Alberta and that preserving the roles of each body within the bicameral system of governance is critical to the success of the institution. He stated that in his role, he must ensure that the separate areas are clearly respected. In response to a member’s question, the Chair provided members with the history of General Faculties Council and why the University of Alberta Senate does not have the authority over institutional academic affairs. A question arose in relation to student discipline and a member expressed concern about the appeal process related to the Student Groups procedure. A GFC member serving on the Academic Planning Committee commented that delegation is an active process where committee members act on the behalf of GFC; he noted that trust in the individuals sitting on committees to exercise delegated authority appropriately is a paramount issue of consideration. Members then engaged in discussion on the use of consent agendas, academic governance training opportunities, secret voting at GFC, clarifying the student role on GFC and making the process clearer to students. A member spoke in favour of constructive, collegial debate at GFC meetings. A member stated that the procedural rules of GFC seem ad hoc and unclear; the Chair commented that members of GFC have rejected the adoption of Robert’s Rules of Order several times. Several student members commented that the 2:00 p.m. start time is problematic and that there was not enough advanced notification about today’s meeting given that their terms had commenced May 1. The Chair thanked members for their comments and reminded members that there is only one more meeting of GFC this academic year. He emphasized that reviewing GFC and its nine Standing Committees is an extremely complicated but very important exercise.",

(EXEC 12 JAN 1998) \nIf a Faculty representative, or a non-student appointed member, misses three consecutive meetings, or \nmore than five meetings in any one academic year, without a reason satisfactory to the members of the \nGFC Executive Committee, the Executive Committee shall declare the position vacant.  If the position is \ndeclared vacant, the Dean will recommend a replacement and advise the Secretary to GFC about the \nmethod used to obtain the replacement. (EXEC 27 APR 1998)  (GFC 15 JUN 1998)    \n4 \n3. Mandate of the Committee \nPowers Retained by General Faculties Council \nAll powers and responsibilities under Section 26 of the PSLA not expressly delegated now or in the \nfuture shall be retained by General Faculties Council. (GFC 02 DEC 1966) \nThe issues which remain with GFC or which would be referred by a Standing Committee to GFC would \ngenerally be in the nature of the following: \n• high level strategic and stewardship policy issues or matters of significant risk to the University;  \n• alterations to the mandate, terms of reference, composition, or structure of a Standing \nCommittee; \n• those things which a Standing Committee considers to be of major strategic significance to or \nlong-term impact on the University;  \n• those matters on which, in the opinion of a Standing Committee chair, there has been a strong \ndivision of opinion within the Standing Committee; and \n• issues in which there is a lack of clarity as to which Standing Committee is responsible. \nPowers of GFC under the PSLA \n• exercise any power of a faculty council that the general faculties council considers desirable to \nexercise; (PSLA Section 26(1)(a)) \n• determine all programs of study to which clause (b) does not apply that are to be offered by the \nuniversity for credit toward the requirements for any degree or diploma; (PSLA Section 26(1)(c)) \n• consider all matters reported to it by any faculty council and communicate its opinion or action \non those matters to the faculty council concerned; (PSLA Section 26(1)(i)) \n• make rules and regulations for the management and operation of libraries; (PSLA Section \n26(1)(k)) \n• make recommendations to the board with respect to affiliation with other institutions, academic \nplanning, campus planning, a building program, the budget, the regulation of residences and \ndining halls, procedures in respect of appointments, promotions, salaries, tenure and \ndismissals, and any other matters considered by the general faculties council to be of interest to \nthe university; (GFC 24 NOV 1980) (GFC 20 NOV 1995). (PSLA Section 26(1)(o)) [Some \naspects of this authority have been delegated to other bodies or Officers and as set out in the \nterms of reference for the appropriate Standing Committees of GFC.] \nPowers Under the PSLA as Delegated in Whole or in Part (PSLA Section 26(1)) \nSubject to the authority of the board, a general faculties council is responsible for the academic affairs \nof the university and has delegated its authority to \n• consider and make decisions on the reports of the faculty councils as to the programs of study \nin the faculties; (GFC 30 MAR 1981) (PSLA Section 26(1)(b)) \n• determine the timetables for examinations and for lectures and other instruction in each faculty; \n(PSLA Section 26(1)(d)) \n• consider and make decisions on the reports of faculty councils as to the appointment of \nexaminers and the conduct and results of examinations in the faculties; (PSLA Section 26(1)(e)) \n• provide for the granting and conferring of degrees other than honorary degrees; (PSLA Section \n26(1)(f)) \n• provide for the preparation and publication of the university calendar; (PSLA Section 26(1)(g)) \n• hear and determine appeals from the decisions of faculty councils on applications, requests or \npetitions by students and others; (GFC 29 JAN 1973) (GFC JUN 23 1975) (EXEC 01 NOV \n2004) (PSLA Section 26(1)(h)) \n5 \nhttp://www.uofaweb.ualberta.ca/gfcpolicymanual/content.cfm?ID_page=37719&section=38695&subsection=38702&contentshow=subsection\nhttp://www.uofaweb.ualberta.ca/gfcpolicymanual/content.cfm?ID_page=37719&section=38695&subsection=38703&contentshow=subsection\n• determine the date for the beginning and end of lectures in the university and also the beginning \nand end of each university term; (PSLA Section 26(1)(j)) \n• recommend to the board the establishment of faculties, schools, departments, chairs and \nprograms of study in the university in any subject that the general faculties council thinks fit; \n(GFC 27 MAY 2002) (PSLA Section 26(1)(l)) \n• make rules and regulations respecting academic awards; (GFC 27 MAY 2002) (PSLA Section \n26(1)(m)) \n• determine standards and policies respecting the admission of persons to the university as \nstudents; (PSLA Section 26(1)(n)) \n• authorize lecturing and teaching on the university premises by persons other than members of \nthe staff of the university; …(Delegated to the appropriate Dean or Director who will act in \nconsultation with the Chair of the Department or other appropriate persons (GFC 02 DEC \n1966)).

Delegated in part to \nDeans with respect to enrolment of students who constitute a danger or who put the public at \nrisk and to the GFC Practice Review Board (PRB). Delegated in part to instructors with respect \nto disruptive behavior in class).  \n4. General Faculties Council Procedures \nGFC has previously voted against adopting Robert’s Rules of Order. GFC is governed, instead, by \nprecedent (as set out in the following procedural rules) and, in situations not covered by precedent, \nGFC is guided by the Chair, whose rulings will be subject to challenge (see GFC 28 OCT 1974). \nDate of GFC Meetings \nCouncil shall normally meet once a month, usually on the last Monday of the month.  The date of each \nmeeting shall be announced one month in advance. (GFC 28 OCT 1968) \nTo enable student and staff members of GFC to attend all meetings, the meetings of GFC shall not be \nscheduled during the period set aside for final examinations and Reading Week. (GFC 24 APR 1978) \n(EXEC 06 NOV 2006) \nThe May meeting of GFC may be held on a Tuesday in order not to conflict with the date of the \nChancellor's Cup. (EXEC 04 OCT 2004) \nGFC Agendas \na. Reports \nReports not requiring action by GFC will be discussed by the Executive Committee (with \ncommittee chairs in attendance) and placed on the GFC agenda for information.  If a GFC \n6 \nhttp://www.uofaweb.ualberta.ca/gfcpolicymanual/content.cfm?ID_page=37719&section=38696&subsection=38708&contentshow=subsection\nmember has a question about a report, or feels that the report should be discussed by GFC, the \nGFC member should notify the Secretary to GFC, in writing, two business days or more before \nGFC meets so that the committee chair can be invited to attend.  Such reports will be discussed \nas the last of the standing items.   (EXEC 06 NOV 2006) \nThe Board Learning and Discovery Committee has directed the Provost and Vice-President \n(Academic) and the Chair of the Board Learning and Discovery Committee, in consultation with \nthe Secretary to General Faculties Council, to review proposals which set out minor, editorial, \nand/or strictly administrative changes to existing University policies and procedures and \ndetermine whether or not, after the proposals have been duly considered and endorsed by the \nGFC Executive Committee or General Faculties Council, the Board Learning and Discovery  \nCommittee would be asked to take formal action on such proposals or simply receive such \nitems for information only. \nIf the Provost and Vice-President (Academic) (or delegate) and the Chair of BEAC (or delegate) \nagree the amendments shall go forward to the Board Learning and Discovery Committee for \ninformation only, the amendments will be considered to be formally approved by the GFC \nExecutive, on behalf of GFC and the Board, at the time the Executive’s decision on the matter is \nrendered or, if considered by GFC, approved by GFC on behalf of the Board. (BG 10 JAN 1997) \nb. Board Reports to GFC \nBoard Reports that are filed with GFC shall be distributed to GFC members for information.  \n(EXEC 06 NOV 2006)   \nc. Executive Committee Minutes \nThis Report is for information only which means that while questions may be asked for \nclarification, no debate may take place on any item.  If a member believes that Council should \ndiscuss a particular action of the Executive Committee, the concern should be sent to the \nExecutive Committee prior to debate at General Faculties Council (GFC 28 OCT 1974) (EXEC \n06 NOV 2006) \nGFC Minutes \nThe record of discussion shall reflect fully the basis of decisions.  ((EXEC 17 JAN 1968) (EXEC 06 \nNOV 2006) \nGFC agendas, minutes and memberships shall be made available to the public.  (EXEC 06 NOV 2006) \nOpen Meetings \nCouncil Chamber Space \nAdmission will be granted on a first-come, first-served basis, to the limit of available space in the \nCouncil Chamber, on the understanding that a limited space may be reserved by the officer responsible \nfor staff or students who have a special interest or competence in particular items on the agenda, and \nwho have been given permission by the Chair to attend and to speak. (GFC 28 OCT 1968) \nNew Committees and Ad Hoc Committees \na. New Committees: When GFC establishes a new committee, GFC (or delegate body) shall provide \nclear, explicit, and detailed terms of reference. (GFC 24 NOV 1980) \nb. Ad Hoc Committees: When an ad hoc committee is in doubt as to the scope of its terms of reference, \nit shall seek clarification and guidance from the Executive Committee of General Faculties Council. \n(EXEC JUN 1971) \n7 \nhttp://www.uofaweb.ualberta.ca/gfcpolicymanual/content.cfm?ID_page=37719&section=38696&subsection=38709&contentshow=subsection\nhttp://www.uofaweb.ualberta.ca/gfcpolicymanual/content.cfm?ID_page=37719&section=38696&subsection=38713&contentshow=subsection\nWhen GFC establishes an ad hoc committee, a reporting date shall be set by the Secretary to GFC. \n(EXEC 03 MAY 1982) \nAd hoc committees shall be considered as being discharged once their reports are received or \naccepted by General Faculties Council unless the committee recommends otherwise, or General \nFaculties Council requests it to continue. (GFC 29 APR 1968) \nAgenda Approval Procedures \nGFC has delegated to the Executive Committee the authority to decide which items are placed on a \nGFC Agenda.  New items cannot be introduced at Council meetings except by a two- thirds vote of \nthose present.  In cases where the Chair or Secretary has been informed in advance of a request to \nadd a new item, the proposal shall be circulated, time permitting, to GFC members, and to Deans for \nonward transmission to staff. (GFC 28 OCT 1974) (GFC 20 SEP 1982) (EXEC 18 OCT 1982) \nWhen the Agenda is being approved, the Chair will entertain a request to change that order, for \nspecified reasons. (EXEC 20 SEPT 2001) \nAmendments \nAn amendment is a subsidiary motion.  It is used to modify the wording - and within certain limits the \nmeaning - of a pending motion before the pending motion itself is voted upon.  Its adoption does not \nadopt the motion thereby amended, and its rejection leaves the pending motion unaltered. (GFC 28 \nOCT 1974) \nThe amendment must be germane; that is, it must be closely related to or have bearing on the subject \nof the motion.  No new subject can be introduced under the pretext of being an amendment. (GFC 28 \nOCT 1974) \nAn amendment must be seconded and is debatable.  Such debate must be confined to the desirability \nof the amendment and must not extend to the merits of the motion to be amended, except as may be \nnecessary to determine whether the amendment is advisable. (GFC 28 OCT 1974) \nAn amendment can be amended, by a motion to amend the amendment. (GFC 28 OCT 1974) \nA majority vote is required. (GFC 28 OCT 1974) \nCalling the Question \nCalls of \"Question!\" by members from their seats are informal expressions of individual members' \ndesires to proceed to a vote on the matter under discussion.  (Such calls are disorderly if made while \nanother member is speaking.)  Upon hearing such a call, the Chair will ask members if they are ready \nto vote on the motion being discussed.  If there appears to be opposition to closing the debate, the \nChair may ask for a motion to close debate.  If seconded, members will then vote on this motion and \nproceed accordingly. (GFC 28 OCT 1974) \nChallenging the Chair \nThe Chair may allow debate on a point of order before making a ruling.  The Chair should state the \nbasis on which such a ruling is made and no debate thereon is permitted. (GFC 28 OCT 1974) \nWhen the Chair rules on a question of procedure, any member may rise and state to the Chair, \"I \nrespectfully appeal to this Council from your ruling.\"  The Chair will respond by stating, \"The Council \nhas heard the ruling of the Chair.  The question is:  Shall the ruling of the Chair be sustained?\"  This \nissue is then put to the vote. (GFC 28 OCT 1974) \n8 \nCommittee of the Whole \nDebate should be either for or against a motion.  However, an issue may arise which is not so clear cut \nor for which the rules may seem to be a hindrance.  In such a case, a motion that Council resolve itself \ninto a Committee of the Whole may be made.  If carried, the visitors are asked to leave the Chamber, \nthe Chair steps down and another Chair is appointed or elected for the duration of the meeting of the \nCommittee of the Whole.  Minutes are not taken and members may speak more freely and informally.  \nA motion need not be seconded in order to be discussed. (GFC 28 OCT 1974) \nWhen the Committee of the Whole reaches agreement, a motion is made \"that the Chair rise and \nreport,\" upon the adoption of which motion the Committee of the Whole is dissolved, the Chair of \nCouncil resumes the Chair and the Chair of the Committee reports to the Chair of Council the action \ntaken by the Committee of the Whole. (GFC 28 OCT 1974) \nDebate Procedures \nIn a special debate, no member may speak for a second time until the Chair is satisfied that all those \nwishing to speak for the first time have done so. \nDebate upon a new item on the Agenda will not be entertained after Council has been sitting for three \nhours.  (GFC 28 OCT 1974) \nImpeachment \nNo member of Council can be impeached. (GFC 03 FEB 1971) \nInterrupting a Speaker \nA member who has the floor may not normally be interrupted.  However, the Chair may interrupt a \nspeaker if the speaker is out of order by using unacceptable language, is abusive of other members, or \nis not speaking to the motion.  If the Chair does not do so, a member may raise this as a point of order.  \nA speaker may not be interrupted because the listener does not agree with what is being said. (GFC 28 \nOCT 1974) \nMotion \nA motion is a formal proposal that the assembly take certain action. To make a motion, a member must \nobtain the floor, that is, the member must be recognized by the Chair.  (In the interest of clarity, it is \nadvisable to write out a motion in advance; giving a copy thereof to the Secretary usually expedites \nbusiness.)  The person making a motion will be invited by the Chair to speak first in any ensuing \ndebate. (GFC 28 OCT 1974) \nA motion must be seconded.  A second merely implies that the seconder agrees that the motion \nshould be debated and not that the seconder necessarily favors the motion.  If no seconder is found, \nthe motion is dead and the meeting moves on to other business. (GFC 28 OCT 1974) \nMotion to Adjourn \nA motion to adjourn is a motion to close the meeting. It must be seconded, is not debatable or \namendable and requires a majority vote. (GFC 28 OCT 1974) \nDuring the months of March and April, motions to adjourn require a two-thirds majority if substantive \nitems of business remain on the agenda.(GFC 26 NOV 2001) \nMotion to Table \nA Motion to Table enables Council to lay aside the pending question until some future time. (GFC 28 \nOCT 1974)  \nA Motion to Table must be seconded and cannot be debated, except that the mover may make a brief \nstatement on what information s/he believes would be necessary to lift an item from the table, followed \n9 \nby the proposer of the original item, who may make a brief comment to Council on the impact of the \ntabling motion. (GFC 28 OCT 1974) (GFC 24 FEB 2003) \nMotion to Take From the Table \nA Motion to Take from the Table is a motion to bring back before Council the matter laid aside.  Upon \nsuch a motion, there shall be a majority vote and no debate. (GFC 28 OCT 1974) \nMotion to Reconsider \nA Motion to Reconsider enables a majority in Council, within a limited time and without notice, to bring \nback for further consideration a motion which has already been voted on. (GFC 28 OCT 1974) \nA Motion to Reconsider has the following characteristics: \n1.    It can be made only by a member who voted originally with the prevailing side.  (This \nprevents abuse by a defeated minority.) (GFC 28 OCT 1974) \n2.     It can be moved only on the same or on the next succeeding meeting day after the original \nvote was taken. (GFC 28 OCT 1974) \n3.    No question can be twice reconsidered. (GFC 28 OCT 1974) \n4.    Such a motion suspends action on the motion to which it applies until it has been decided. \n(GFC 28 OCT 1974) \n5.     Action which cannot be reversed cannot be reconsidered. (GFC 28 OCT 1974) \n6.     A motion to reconsider is debatable - unless the motion to which it applies was \nundebatable.  Only a majority vote is required. (GFC 28 OCT 1974) \nThe effect of a Motion to Reconsider is to restore proceedings to the point immediately prior to the vote \nto which it applies. (GFC 28 OCT 1974) \nMotion to Rescind \nA Motion to Rescind is the motion by which a previous act or order can be cancelled or \ncountermanded.  A Motion to Rescind must be seconded, is debatable and amendable. (GFC 28 OCT \n1974) \nA Motion to Rescind requires a two-thirds vote of the total membership if no Notice of Motion has been \ngiven.  If Notice of Motion to Rescind has been given at the previous meeting, a majority vote will \nsuffice. (GFC 28 OCT 1974) \nA Motion to Rescind is only used when a Motion to Reconsider is out of time. (GFC 28 OCT 1974) \nNotice of Motion \nA Notice of Motion is a method of informing the membership in advance of the intention to make a \nspecific motion. (GFC 28 OCT 1974) \nWhen Notice of Motion has first been given at a GFC meeting, the GFC Executive Committee will \ndecide whether it is appropriate that such a motion be placed on the Agenda of the next GFC meeting. \n(GFC 28 OCT 1974) \n10 \nPoint of Order \nIt is the right of every member who notices a breach of the rules of Council to insist on their \nenforcement.  If the Chair fails to notice such a breach, any member may make the appropriate Point of \nOrder, calling on the Chair for a ruling.  If the Chair, being in doubt, refers the point of order to the \njudgement of Council, it thereby becomes debatable. (GFC 28 OCT 1974) \nA Point of Order is the only time when a member is allowed to interrupt a speaker who has the floor. \n(GFC 28 OCT 1974) \nA Point of Order does not require a seconder, it is not debatable (except in the circumstance noted \nabove), it is not amendable, and cannot be reconsidered. (GFC 28 OCT 1974) \nA Point of Order should not be raised which has nothing to do with procedure and is merely a tactic to \nsay something which would not normally be allowed. (GFC 28 OCT 1974) \nQuestion Period Procedure \nGeneral Faculties Council has approved the practice of a Question Period of one half hour in length, \nwhich is a regular standing item on the Agenda of each regular meeting of General Faculties Council. \nWritten questions may be submitted to the Secretary at any time before a GFC meeting.  If a written \nresponse is required, then written questions must be received at least SIX working days before a GFC \nmeeting.  The questions should contain no argument or opinion or facts other than those necessary for \nexplanation. \nThe administration will make every attempt to submit written responses to University Governance in \ntime for mailing to GFC members (normally by the Thursday before a Monday GFC meeting). \nSupplementary questions may be asked during the Question Period providing they relate to the subject \nmatter of the question under discussion. \nThe answer should contain no argument or opinion or fact other than those necessary for explanation.  \nThe answer is not debatable. \nAfter written questions and replies have been received by Council, questions from the floor will be \npermitted.  The total time for Question Period is 30 minutes, unless Council, at the end of that time, \nvotes to extend.  If GFC members want to have an issue debated, they are asked to submit the issue to \nthe Executive Committee. \nQuestions may be submitted in writing in advance of GFC meetings.  In such cases, the Secretary will \ndirect it to the appropriate officer(s) of the University for a reply.  Questions must be factual in nature \nand contain no argument. (GFC 24 FEB 2003) \nIf the recipient considers that a question is not factual, contains argument or opinion or facts other than \nthose necessary for explanation of the question, or is outside the scope of GFC responsibilities, or that \nan excessive amount of time, effort, expenditure and/or resources will be required to provide an \nanswer, the recipient shall return the question to the questioner and work with the questioner to narrow \nthe scope of the question.(GFC 24 FEB 2003) \nIn cases of dispute between the recipient and questioner, or where no agreement can be reached, the \nrecipient or questioner may refer the question to the GFC Executive Committee for a ruling on whether \nthe question is proper.  If the Executive Committee deems that the question is not proper, the question \nwill not be answered – the Executive Committee’s decision is final and binding. (GFC 24 FEB 2003) \n11 \nWhere a question is submitted from the floor during the Question Period, the Chair will rule on whether \nor not it can be answered expeditiously from the floor.  If it cannot, the question will then be referred to \nthe appropriate officer as if it were a written question.  (GFC 24 FEB 2003) \nIn order to provide more time for Administration to submit an answer, the Secretary to GFC will: \n1. Mail the answer to GFC members if the Secretary to GFC receives it in time for the mailing. \n2.  If the Secretary to GFC receives the answer after the mailing but before the GFC meeting, the \nSecretary will set the answer out on the tables at the meeting and e-mail it to members prior to the \nmeeting. \nQuorum \nA quorum is the minimum number of members who must be present for business to be transacted \nlegally.  In the case of General Faculties Council this is one-third of the total membership, except in the \nmonths of April, May and June when the quorum shall be one-quarter of the total membership. (GFC 28 \nOCT 1974) (GFC 20 SEP 1982) (GFC 03 APR 1995) (GFC 18 MAR 1996) \nVoting Procedures \nWhen the electronic voting system installed in the Council Chamber shows a difference of five or less in \nthe votes counted for and against a Motion, there shall be a second electronic vote. The second vote \nshall be the final result.  (GFC 28 OCT 1974) \nVoting shall be by majority vote except on a Motion to Rescind without previous notice, when a two-\nthirds vote of those present is required. (GFC 28 OCT 1974) \nThe results of all votes taken at GFC meetings shall be announced by the Secretary.  The results of \nGFC votes shall not be recorded in the Minutes. (GFC 28 OCT 1974) (GFC 28 APR 1980)  \nAll members of GFC are charged with the responsibility of examining issues before Council and voting \nas they judge fit on such issues.  No member of GFC, regardless of how that person gains membership \non Council, is an instructed delegate. (GFC 28 OCT 1974) \nThe Secretary \nThe following are the main duties of the Secretary: \n• To serve the General Faculties Council and its Executive Committee as Secretary by arranging \nall meetings, preparing agendas and ensuring that comprehensive documentation, including an \noutline of the issues, is distributed. \n• To take whatever action is necessary in order to implement all decisions made by General \nFaculties Council and its Executive Committee. \n• To ensure that minutes concerning all meetings of General Faculties Council and action \nsummaries concerning all meetings of the GFC Executive Committee are available. (EXEC 30 \nAUG 1999)  \n• To ensure the rotation and replenishment of student and staff members on General Faculties \nCouncil and all its Standing Committees. \n• To act as the Officer responsible for the operation of procedures established for the approval of \nall new or altered courses at the University and for the approval of changes to existing \nprograms.
