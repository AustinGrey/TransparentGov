Discussion: The Chair reported that over 400 pages of material had been gathered through meetings, round tables, forums, and online contributions; however, there had been limited feedback on the University’s vision, mission and values statement, which are integral elements of the institution’s mandate. In the discussion that followed, it was suggested that the wording was adequate but could be strengthened and made more concise. A member suggested that the University of Alberta’s unique delivery of a bilingual and multicultural educational experience should be emphasized within the statements, and that students are requesting specific changes to the language in this regard. A member noted that the language used within the “Pride” section could be amended. A member offered concluding remarks that although the existing and proposed statements are adequate, that there are remaining gaps, and she encouraged a deeper look into them. The Chair thanked members for their suggestions, and pointed out that there are still opportunities to provide feedback, in person and online.",

            "Description": "Purpose of the Proposal: To frame the initial discussion of the revitalization of academic governance and establish next steps in the process of considering recent reports and discussion papers on GFC reforms. Discussion: The Chair noted that collegial governance involves many individuals participating in the decision-making process and that the current GFC has been shaped by decisions made by its members over time. He added that GFC will continue to change in response to the decisions made by the current membership. The Chair referred the members to the package developed by GFC Executive Committee to frame the discussion on academic governance at the University of Alberta. He further noted that the two Motions added to the agenda relate to this important issue and would be considered with this item. A member noted that this is an important and timely discussion. Members commented on a number of items: one member suggested the GFC should consider mandatory attendance to ensure that the diverse views of all Faculties are represented; another member suggested that the day and time of GFC meeting should be re-visited as a Tuesday or Thursday slot might work better for student attendance. A member noted that the information about academic governance on the University Governance website was difficult to understand. A member noted that Council on Student Affairs (COSA), a body under GFC within the Post-Secondary Learning Act (PSLA), was going be reviewed in terms of mandate, structure and scope. Members discussed the importance of communication, suggesting that improving the flow of information from GFC and its Standing Committees should be a priority. A member noted that GFC may be hindered legislatively by the Post-Secondary Learning Act (PSLA), indicating that the Board of Governors retains a lot of unilateral authority over matters at the University. The member further noted that there has been discussion surrounding this balance of power among other western Canadian universities recently. The Chair, in response, pointed out that GFC graduate student member Mr Brayden Whitlock had recently published an article on this issue entitled, “Who Watches Academic Watch Dogs?” The Chair stated that the University of Alberta’s GFC is twice the size of the average academic senate, which may have an impact on how decisions are made and invited members to discuss GFC’s delegations. Members expressed concern that the delegation of authority meant that important items were not reaching the floor of GFC and that GFC was just rubber stamping decisions. Members agreed that committee delegations should reviewed on a regular basis. It was noted by a member that, when delegations are made, the full implications may not be realized. One member expressed his struggle with the mandate of GFC Executive to consider urgent matters on behalf of GFC. Regarding committees, a member pointed out the value of having smaller, more specialized bodies to consider proposals in detail and noted that standing committees consider very technical things which, in concert with member composition, provide a very high-quality service to GFC. A member suggested that standing committees should realize when strategic items should be brought forward to GFC. A member cautioned that de-delegation could overload GFC with a lot of minor business, such as course and program changes. A member noted that the issue may be how to get GFC involved in meaningful initiatives and suggested GFC engage in a discussion of principles. Another member indicated that GFC should be involved in the discussion of critical issues and that a cultural change may be required to foster this. The Chair of the GFC Nominating Committee, Dr van der Baan, noted that the committee uses a summary document of each GFC Standing Committee’s Terms of Reference, which members have found useful. He also reminded members that a new replenishment cycle has begun should members choose to serve on a standing committee. A member suggested that the standing committees could be asked to provide GFC with an annual report of activities undertaken with delegated authority from GFC. Another member noted that the standing committees have started regularly reporting to GFC on activities. It was also noted that minutes and meeting materials are available online at the governance website. A member suggested that members of GFC could be notified when agendas for all upcoming GFC standing committee meetings were available online. The Chair suggested that the process could begin with a review of GFC’s delegations, and he invited the University Secretary to comment. Ms Haggarty-France noted that in addition to GFC’s delegated authority to its Standing Committees, there is delegated authority from the Board of Governors, within the University of Alberta Policies and Procedures Online (UAPPOL), to individuals, and to other units such as Faculty Councils.; A member indicated her strong support for using the Students’ Union Report as the basis for the future changes to academic governance, citing the specificity in the document, such as improvements to minutes and receiving advice. There was a discussion on what was meant by the term “guided by” in the Motion. A member of GFC indicated that this meant to indicate that the document will be considered. He further noted that this document was selected because it specifically mentions discussions, reporting and a commitment towards the notion of collegial governance and informed decision-making. The Chair clarified that if the Motion is carried, GFC is not held to all of the recommendations within the Report. The mover and seconder agreed to the friendly amendment to say “informed by” instead of “guided by”. The Chair stated that the GFC Executive Committee would review this issue in greater detail and report back to GFC with a plan. He also noted the possibility of scheduling an additional meeting of GFC in this academic year for further discussion.",

Discussion: Dr Forgie and Dr Delinger summarized the findings of the report evaluating the move to online Universal Students Ratings of Instruction (USRIs) at the University of Alberta. They reported that the transition of the USRI from paper format to electronic means has resulted in a drop in average response rates, but noted that median scores remained the same with lab sections experiencing a greater decrease in response rates compared to lecture sections. Dr Delinger noted that this is consistent with the experience of other institutions that have made the transition to electronic USRI tools. Dr Forgie noted that the data would continue to be monitored. During the ensuing discussion, members expressed several comments and questions surrounding how much money this initiative has saved the institution; whether the data could include the race and gender of the instructor; an update in regards to written comments; and USRI usage for courses with ten students or less.",

Ms Persson added that the most frequently disclosed matters continue to be discrimination and harassment, but OSDHR received report of numerous other issues including safety, fraud and the application of collective agreements. Ms Persson also provided members with a summary of OSDHR educational activities undertaken within the community during the reporting period.",

I am \nenergized by the progress of the Institutional Strategic Plan and am hopeful that members of campus \nwill be able to see themselves reflected in the plan. \nWe have occasionally heard through this consultation process, “why do we need a plan for the whole \nuniversity?” By providing a clear direction, the university’s strategic plan is the single most powerful tool \nfor building a shared vision, enabling co-ordinated efforts, and maximizing finite resources. Our goal is \nto develop a plan that all members of the U of A community create and embrace. It must reflect our \ncommon values and capture our collective vision of what the university aspires to be. In the years \nahead, we will look to this one strategic plan to guide all institutional academic and administrative \npriority-setting, and decision-making.  \nIt was great to see so many GFC members at the joint Board of Governors, GFC, Senate and Alumni \nCouncil Executive retreat on November 23rd. This retreat was the first time that all four of these \nconstituents met around a shared purpose: to identify and understand the critical opportunities and \nchallenges facing the University of Alberta over the next ten years. I look forward to bringing these \ngroups together again to have continued dialogue.  \nI look forward to a robust discussion at this GFC about the mission and values of the university and \nwhether they reflect our current experience and future aspirations. Equally important is the discussion \naround academic governance and how the academic community makes decisions within a collegial \nenvironment.  \nThe coming year will give us some renewal of leadership with several Dean searches set to be \ncompleted in the coming months and with the search for our next Chancellor underway. I encourage all \nmembers of the university community to consider nominating a deserving individual for this key role in \nthe next month.  \nYours sincerely,  \nDavid H. Turpin, CM, LLD, FRSC \nPresident and Vice-Chancellor \nhttp://www.president.ualberta.ca/\n2 \nREPORT OF THE PRESIDENT TO GENERAL FACULTIES COUNCIL \nJANUARY 2016 \nBuilding Community Engagement \nMy focus has been on establishing connections with the university and with our supporters locally, \nprovincially and nationally. Below is a summary of those activities since the last General Faculties \nCouncil meeting: \nInternal Groups \nCampus Forum – Provost and Vice-President (Academic) Steven Dew and I have co-hosted several \nCampus Fora to allow for broad-based engagement throughout the institutional strategic planning \nprocess. Attendees have included, faculty, staff and students, and each Forum has also been \nlivestreamed with over 700 individuals watching online. This consultation is part of a series of \ninstitution-wide events to engage the campus community in the development of the university’s next \ninstitutional strategic plan that have taken place on several campuses.  \nRoundtable Discussions – We held several roundtables with the campus community in the month \nleading to the Holiday Break. These sessions facilitated deeper discussion around many topics and \nbrought to light a number of considerations for the ISP. \nConvocation Ceremonies – It was a privilege to address the convocants who received their degree at \nthe fall ceremonies. I was inspired to see so many bright faces cross the stage and shake their hands \nas they became alumni of the U of A. In addition, the University of Alberta welcomed three more \nhonorary degree recipients into our prestigious group: Hugh Bolton, Her Honour Lois Mitchell and \nSamantha Nutt each received an honorary degree during the fall convocation ceremonies. \nPresident’s Executive Committee – While I meet with this group weekly, we were able spend some \nextra time in January on in-depth discussions around the Institutional Strategic Plan. Our one-day \nretreat focused around a discussion of the feedback we have received thus far. \nExternal Groups \nGovernment – Since my last report I hosted Minister Lori Sigurdson, Minister of Advanced Education \nand Minister of Jobs, Skills, Training and Labour for a tour of North Campus with the team from the \nHealth Sciences Council. This was her first official tour on campus and the morning was a great \nsuccess. \nI have also continued our extensive engagement with government through meetings with MPs Linda \nDuncan and Randy Boissonnault and a visit to Ottawa January 20-22nd to meet with several federal \nofficials. I have also met with provincial deputy ministers.  \nDonors and Industry Supporters – Engaging with key donors and industry partners is a critical aspect of \nmy role and I am pleased with the results of these meetings. Through fostering these relationships, the \nuniversity can realize a variety of positive outcomes. I have travelled recently to Calgary, and Ottawa \nand continue to have strategic meetings in Edmonton, as well.  \n3 \nInitiate Institutional Strategic Planning Process  \nThe undertaking of an Institutional Strategic Plan is among my top priorities at the University of Alberta. \nI am pleased with the progress thus far. We are now coming to the end of the first phase of the \ninstitutional strategic planning process and quickly moving towards the next step: the preparation the \nfirst draft of the plan.  \nWe have convened the Institutional Strategic Planning Advisory Committee, which consists of 21 \nrepresentatives from across U of A’s campuses, faculties, disciplines, student groups, and employee \ncategories. Steve and I have asked them to provide their input and advice throughout the ISP drafting \nprocess. Members of the committee have attended consultation events to listen and learn from the \ncommunity, and they are helping us to assess, interpret, and analyze feedback from the in-person and \nonline feedback to identify emerging themes and draft potential strategies. A list of committee members \ncan be found on the ISP website.  \nSteve and I have held a series of campus forums and roundtable strategic planning discussions. One or \nboth of us have also met directly with the Students’ Union Council, the Students’ Council of Faculty \nAssociations, the Graduate Students’ Association, President’s Advisory Committee of Chairs, GFC’s \nAcademic Planning Committee, Senate Plenary, Indigenous Education Council, Library Council, among \nothers, to consult with them on building the next strategic plan. Additionally we have met with many \ngroups of faculty, staff, and students, as well as members of the Board of Governors, Senate, and \nAlumni Council. In total more than 700 people attended campus consultation events and we have \nreceived more than 100 online and email responses. Members of the ISP Advisory Committee have \nbeen on hand at many public events to listen and hear from the community. \nThe feedback collected through all of these avenues has been as posted online for review by the \nuniversity community. This step allows us to share what we have heard from members of our \ncommunity, and to facilitate a conversation about the process and the outcomes so far. Each set of \nnotes includes a summary page, followed by a complete transcript. We will continue to update this \nrepository as our consultation continues.  \nWe are now working with the ISP Advisory Committee and executive team to identify emerging themes \nand begin the task of drafting specific strategies and goals. We aim to have a first draft available to the \ncampus community by late February or early March, and will continue to elicit feedback through \ncampus forums and online mechanisms as we move forward.  \nAdvancing Specific Priorities \n1) Maskwa House of Learning - Update \nI have received significant and encouraging support for the Maskwa Proposal. Many individuals and \ngroups from the Indigenous community, government and university communities have shown great \ninterest in the project and I am heartened from the support to-date.  \n4 \n2) Scholarship for Syrian Students \nThis award has been offered to two students originally from Syria who have now begun their studies at \nthe University of Alberta. This initiative will continue to search for candidates for the program and assist \ndeserving scholars in need. \nGood News  \nWith the caliber of work being done across our campuses every day we are fortunate at the University \nof Alberta to have many successes I could tell you about. Every day our faculty, operational staff and \nstudents have news-worth accomplishments, each with a history, a future and a team of individuals that \nhelped make it happen. Here is a short update on a few priority projects:  \n1) Maintained relative standing in the Times Higher Education World University Rankings of “most \ninternational universities” – Amongst 13 Canadian universities, the University of Alberta has \nmaintained its position as fourth behind the UBC, McGill and Montreal. All Canadian universities \nthat ranked on this list of top 200 schools from around the world dropped somewhat in absolute \nrank due largely to a change in methodology of the ranking from previous years.  \n2) CAUS team (Financials) – Olds College financials are now being handled by University of \nAlberta. This project has been in the works for several years and the success of this project is \nbased on significant time and effort from the CAUS team. The successful implementation of \nCAUS Financials at Olds College lends to the opportunity and promise to expand this program \nat other institutions. \n3) University of Alberta International (UAI) Share the Cheer – Over the holiday season the \nuniversity community opened their doors to international students who may be far from family or \nmay be unfamiliar with some of the traditions celebrated in Edmonton and Canada. This year \n176 individuals and 6 families were matched with 71 staff, faculty, and alumni hosts. Thank you \nto all those who hosted.  \n4) Mountains 101 – The University of Alberta is set to launch its next Massive Open Online Course \n(MOOC) this coming fall. The U of A’s Canadian Mountain Studies Initiative has struck a \npartnership that will see Parks Canada assist with course content and distribution of promotional \nmaterials. This will be the third in a successful series of U of A MOOCs to date. The timing is \nwonderful if you feel like exploring the Rockies this summer in preparation for the release of the \ncourse as our National Parks will have free entry throughout 2016 in recognition of 150 years \nsince confederation.  \n5 \nAwards: \nCouncil for Advancement and Support of Education (CASE) – The U of A’s Advancement Strategic \nCommunications Team has been honored with 21 awards in District VIII. The awards span all aspects \nof communications — from writing to photography and videography, social media and design.  \nWeston Family Prize for Lifetime Achievement in Northern Research – University of Alberta researcher \nIan Sterling has been awarded a Lifetime Achievement work for his efforts over more than 35 years to \nunderstand the ecology of the Artic and its marine life. His work has led to an new era of understanding \nof the North.  \nDistinguished Service Award for Legal Scholarship - The Law Society of Alberta/Canadian Bar \nAssociation Alberta Branch has awarded Mitchell McInnes, a professor in the Faculty of Law, with a \n2016 Distinguished Service Award in Legal Scholarship. This award is an honour for Mitchell, the \nFaculty of Law and the university and recognizes his prolific scholarly output and impact.  \nItem No. 4 \nGENERAL FACULTIES COUNCIL \nFor the Meeting of January 25, 2016 \nOUTLINE OF ISSUE \nAgenda Title: Institutional Strategic Plan – A discussion on Vision, Mission and Values \nMotion:  N/A \nItem   \nAction Requested Approval Recommendation  Discussion/Advice Information \nProposed by David H.

Any institution’s vision, mission, and values define its community’s core story and attributes \nand provide a frame for its strategic goals and priorities—the same is true for the University of Alberta. \nOur vision, mission, and values help to answer to two key questions: “who are we?” and “why do we \nundertake the work we do?” As the academic core of the University, GFC is the right body to engage in \nthis discussion. \nAt the January 25th meeting, we would like GFC to consider whether our current vision, mission, and \nvalues statements continue to be appropriate or if updates are needed. For your added consideration, \nwe also include: 1) three core values common to all Canadian universities; and 2) a list of values and \nprinciples that have implicitly and explicitly emerged from the ideas and feedback received during our \nconsultations to date, some of which underline the continued currency of our values, while other \nperhaps push us in new directions.  \nWe look forward to hearing your input and advice on this next Monday. \nDavid H.

The White \nPaper was discussed at GFC Executive in April 2013 and at GFC in June 2013. The SU \nDiscussion Paper was discussed at GFC Executive in March 2014.  \nIn addition, in response to calls for increased discussion at GFC meetings, the GFC Executive \nCommittee developed and discussed guidelines for discussion topics for GFC meetings in \nJanuary/February 2015. \nIn response to a request from the floor at the September 28, 2015 GFC meeting, the Report of the \nTask Force on GFC Reforms was posted online for the information of the community with the \ncommitment of further discussion at GFC on this issue. \nThe GFC Executive Committee reviewed all four documents and associated meeting minutes at \nthe December 7, 2015, and January 11, 2016 meetings in order to frame the discussion for full \nGFC. \nRecommendations made in reports and institutional governance principles: \nMany recommendations were articulated in the SU Discussion Paper and the Report of the Task \nForce, and links to these documents are included. The recommendations made should be \nconsidered in context. Some may continue to resonate, while others, for a variety of reasons, may \nnot.  \nA number of themes arose from these documents: \n• Lack of substantive discussion at GFC \n• Questions regarding delegation \n• Committee structure – role, size, number, membership, overlap, gaps (IT, research), \ninformation flow between committees \n• Slow pace with which proposals go through governance pathways \n• Online records, particularly archives \n Page 2 \nAnother complication with the recommendations is that they are presented at a high level of detail \nwithout asking more foundational questions about the contemporary vision and underlying \nprinciples of governance at the institution. \nFraming a GFC Discussion \nIt is recognized that academic governance is a cornerstone of the University. An effective, \nengaged General Faculties Council and its standing committees is essential to fulfilling the \nresponsibility of GFC. It is clear that subsequent to a re-appraisal of the principles of governance, \nkey issues will be identified and a course of action can be established toward addressing each \nissue. \nThis conversation should start with a high level discussion on the principles that should guide any \nchanges to the current structure that we might want to make. What is the business that full GFC \nshould be discussing and deciding upon? Where does GFC see the balance to be struck between \nlarge policy/strategy issues and more detailed matters? What do you expect of academic \ngovernance? \nThis conversation will hopefully lead to a more detailed set of questions and discussions around \nacademic governance. \nNext Steps  \nIn its mandated role as the executive body of GFC, GFC Executive Committee is willing to facilitate \nmoving the process forward.  \nThe GFC Executive Committee suggests that, after a high level discussion of academic \ngovernance by full GFC and conversation about key issues, the GFC Executive Committee or \nsome other group be tasked to develop concrete plans to prioritize and address the issues in \naccordance with the principles and emphases expressed by full GFC.   \nThe committee is requesting direction and guidance from GFC on how it wishes to proceed.  \nThe following documents and minutes are included with the GFC January 25, 2016 Agenda materials - Item \n5: Academic Governance at the University of Alberta: \n• Academic Governance: Moving Forward - White Paper on General Faculties Council Reforms, \nGFC meeting of June 3, 2013 \n• Minutes of GFC Executive, April 26, 2013 \n• Minutes of GFC, June 3, 2013 \n• Students’ Union Discussion Paper on General Faculties Council, GFC Executive Committee \nmeeting of March 13, 2014 \n Page 3 \n• Minutes of GFC Executive Committee, March 13, 2014 \n• Report of Task Force on GFC Reforms, July 31, 2014 \n• Guidelines for Discussion Topics for Meetings of General Faculties Council (GFC), GFC Executive \nCommittee meeting of February 23, 2015 \n• Minutes of GFC Executive Committee, September 8, 2014 \n• Minutes of GFC Executive Committee, November 12, 2014 \n• Minutes of GFC Executive Committee, January 12, 2015 \n• Minutes of GFC Executive Committee, February 23, 2015 \nItem No. 6 \nGENERAL FACULTIES COUNCIL \nFor the Meeting of June 3, 2013 \n OUTLINE OF ISSUE \nAgenda Title: Academic Governance:  Moving Forward \nMotion:  N/A \nItem   \nAction Requested Approval Recommendation  Discussion/Advice Information \nProposed by Indira Samarasekera, President and Chair, General Faculties Council \nPresenter Indira Samarasekera, President and Chair, General Faculties Council \nSubject General Faculties Council (GFC) and GFC Standing Committees \nDetails \nResponsibility Indira Samarasekera, President \nThe Purpose of the Proposal is \n(please be specific) \nTo engage the GFC Executive Committee and General Faculties Council \n(GFC) in a discussion with regard to the role and responsibilities of GFC \nand its standing committee system and to discuss the striking of a \nPresidential task force to review the Terms of Reference and activities of \neach GFC committee and provide recommendations for reform. \nThe Impact of the Proposal is See ‘Purpose’.  \nReplaces/Revises (eg, policies, \nresolutions) \nN/A \nTimeline/Implementation Date Summer and Fall, 2013. \nEstimated Cost N/A \nSources of Funding N/A \nNotes N/A \nAlignment/Compliance \nAlignment with Guiding \nDocuments \nDare to Discover and Dare to Deliver \nCompliance with Legislation, \nPolicy and/or Procedure \nRelevant to the Proposal \n(please quote legislation and \ninclude identifying section \nnumbers) \n1.

White Paper on General Faculties Council Reforms (pages 1 – 3) \nPrepared by: Catherine Swindlehurst, Director, Office of the President, swindlehurst@ualberta.ca  \nmailto:swindlehurst@ualberta.ca\n1 \nDraft White Paper on General Faculties Council Reforms \nOffice of the President \nMay 24, 2013 \nIntroduction \nThe General Faculties Council is integral to the governance and operation of the University of \nAlberta. An effective governance system, particularly within GFC, is imperative to building \nexcellence across the institution. Good governance depends on ensuring the institution has \nrelevant processes and structures to support informed representatives of the University in their \ndecision-making on behalf of the University community. Within GFC and its standing \ncommittees, there are 370 members who provide their time, expertise and service to the \nuniversity community. GFC depends on an engaged community of members working within an \neffective governance system. \nIn order to ensure that our governance system is working effectively, we, as members of this \nsystem, must undertake a periodic review of the structures and processes to ensure that they \nare effective and clearly defined. With significant changes to our institution on the horizon, now \nis the time to ensure that we have the best governance foundation in place to support our \npeople to make the best decisions for the future of the University of Alberta. We have the \nopportunity to revitalize GFC and ensure that the committees are engaged and debating the \ntopics that are the mandate of the GFC, as outlined in the Post-Secondary Learning Act. \nPlan \nIn order to ensure that the GFC system is functioning effectively and efficiently, GFC should \nundertake a review of all of its committees and the overall GFC structure. This process is timely \ngiven the provincial government’s commitment to ensuring effective governance practices \nwithin Alberta’s post-secondary institutions, and compliance with the Public Agencies \nGovernance Framework and the upcoming Alberta Public Agencies Governance Act (APAGA). \nA small task force will be struck by the President, the Chair of GFC, to conduct an independent \nreview of the Terms of Reference and activities of each committee and provide \nrecommendations for reform. In order to maintain its objectivity, the GFC Task Force will \nconsist of two faculty members who have relevant academic and/or professional background \nand expertise in governance. The GFC Secretary will consult with the Task Force in an advisory \ncapacity.  \nAttachment 1\nhttp://www.qp.alberta.ca/1266.cfm?page=p19p5.cfm&leg_type=Acts&isbncln=9780779737932\n2 \nFigure 1: GFC Committee Structure (from Governance 101 presentation) \nThe GFC Task Force will objectively review GFC committees’ structure and activities, and the \nevolution of these, as compared to each committee’s terms of reference, and the PSLA. \nSpecifically, the GFC Task Force will examine: \n1. Each GFC committee’s Terms of Reference to ensure that the terms are up-to-date and \nreflect University policies and the PSLA, but also the current operations of each \ncommittee. \n2. Each committee’s activities to ensure that they are focused on governance issues \nrelevant to that committee, and not activities that are the responsibility of other \ncommittees or administrative offices. \n3. The alignment of the committees to identify duplication and/or gaps in committee \nactivities, as it relates to the governance pathways within GFC committees.  \nIt is imperative that GFC and its committees, University Governance, the Offices of the \nPresident and the Vice-Presidents remain at arms’ length in this process, to ensure that the GFC \nTask Force retains its independence and objectivity in gathering its data and drafting its report \nand recommendations. \nThe GFC Task Force will submit a report of its findings and recommendations to President \nSamarasekera, the Chair of GFC, for review, by the end of August, 2013. The President will \nreview the findings and present the recommendations to the GFC Executive, at its meeting on \nOctober 7, 2013. GFC Executive will consider the recommendations and forward them on to \nGFC for discussion at Council’s October 28th GFC meeting.  \n3 \nTimeline \nIn order to have recommendations approved and ready for implementation in Fall 2013, the \nfollowing timeline is proposed: \n• April 26, 2013 – the GFC Reform White Paper is presented to and discussed by GFC \nExecutive. An implementation plan and process will be decided at this meeting, and \nrecommendations for task force membership. \n• June 3, 2013 – The implementation plan is presented to GFC, and the task force is struck.  \n• August 31, 2013 – Task force report due to the Chair of GFC.  \n• October 7, 2013 – Recommendations presented to GFC Executive for consideration. \n• October 28, 2013 – Recommendations presented to GFC for discussion. \nGeneral Faculties Council  \nExecutive Committee \nApproved Open Session Minutes \nFriday, April 26, 2013 \n2-31 SAB, South Academic Building \n2:00 PM – 4:00 PM \nATTENDEES: \nVoting Members: \nMartin Ferguson-Pell \n(Delegate) \nActing Provost and Vice-President (Academic) and Chair, GFC Executive \nCommittee (delegate) \nColleen Skidmore \n(Delegate) \nVice-Provost and Associate Vice-President (Academic)  \nGerry Kendal Vice-Provost and University Registrar \nDustin Chelen Students’ Union Vice-President (Academic) \nNathan Andrews Graduate Student Association Vice-President (Academic) \nEd Blackburn Academic Staff, Member of GFC \nLise Gotell Academic Staff, Member of GFC \nWendy Rodgers Academic Staff, Member of GFC \nChris de Gara Academic Staff, Member of GFC \nAnita Molzahn Academic Staff, Member of GFC \nDuncan Saunders Academic Staff, Member of GFC \nKaori Kabata Academic Staff, Member of GFC \nAdam Woods Undergraduate Student, Member of GFC \nPresenter(s):  \nMartin Ferguson-Pell Acting Provost and Vice-President (Academic) and Acting Chair, GFC \nExecutive Committee \nIndira Samarasekera President and Chair, General Faculties Council (GFC) \nStaff:  \nGarry Bodnar Director, General Faculties Council (GFC) Services and Secretary to GFC \nMarion Haggarty-France University Secretary \nAndrea Patrick Scribe \nOPENING SESSION \n1.  Approval of the Agenda \nMaterials before members are contained in the official meeting file. \nMotion:  de Gara/Rodgers \nGFC Executive Committee / 4/26/2013 \nPage 2 \nTHAT the GFC Executive Committee approve the Agenda. \nCARRIED \n2. Comments from the Chair and President, General Faculties Council (GFC) \nDr Ferguson-Pell reminded members to check for updates on the Change@Ualberta website regarding the \nimpact of the Provincial Budget and the Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) (previously called the \n“Letter of Expectation”) between the Ministry of Enterprise and Advanced Education (EAE) and the \nUniversity of Alberta. \nDr Ferguson-Pell reported that the tuition increase for the 2013-14 academic year, approved by the Board \nof Governors, was recently disallowed by the Ministry of EAE and that there will be resulting difficulties if \nthe University of Alberta is no longer allowed to increase tuition when necessary. \nHe noted that Faculty-specific budget letters will be forwarded to each Dean shortly. \nDr Ferguson-Pell reported that Central Administration is currently revising the institutional budget, and it will \nbe available for review by the May 22, 2013 GFC Academic Planning Committee (APC) meeting. \nDr Samarasekera briefed members on the meeting between the Ministry of EAE and the 26 Alberta post-\nsecondary presidents held on April 11, 2013.  She noted that the presidents met separately on the morning \nof the meeting and, at that time, items for discussion included the shared sentiment that post-secondary \ninstitutions were blindsided by the funding cuts announced within the Provincial Budget. \nShe stated that the subsequent meeting with the Ministry was a success, citing frankness and openness in \nthe messaging from the presidents to the Ministry.  She reported that those messages related to the \nnegative impact of the budget cuts on Campus Alberta initiatives, issues related to duplication, and the joint \nimpact of receiving sudden, significantly reduced funding as well as losing the ability to increase tuition \nwhen necessary.  She added that the presidents attempted to dispel myths at the meeting.  \nDr Samarasekera noted that further negotiations at the meeting led to the conversion of the Letter of \nExpectation into an MOU format, with additional time to make appropriate revisions extended to \nSeptember, 2013. \nDr Samarasekera reported that the presidents met on April 15, 2013 in Red Deer, and there was \nagreement to create a council of presidents.  She noted that each president will draft a position paper on \ncertain relevant issues including the re-opening of the Post-Secondary Learning Act (PSLA), funding \nframework, tuition, and Campus Alberta. \nDr Samarasekera stated that she continues to push for long-term investment in the University of Alberta.  \nShe explained that the major problems within Alberta’s post-secondary educational landscape relate to \naccess and quality, and that these problems are evidence-based. \nShe reported that Mr Thomas Lukaszuk, Minister of EAE, has offered to continually meet with presidents, \nboard chairs, and students and that she hopes the messaging towards all three groups will be consistent.  \nShe noted that she has a meeting with the Minister next week. \nDr Samarasekera briefed members on the Board of Governors’ Strategic Retreat, held from April 16-19, \n2013.  She stated that the timing of the Retreat was beneficial considering the recent challenges faced by \nthe University of Alberta, however purely coincidental as it was planned approximately one year ago. \nGFC Executive Committee / 4/26/2013 \nPage 3 \nShe reported that the Board of Governors committed unanimously to being one of the best universities in \nthe world and that they requested short- and long-term plans from her, as President.  She stated that the \nRetreat provided clear direction in terms of excellence and reinforced the need to look internally as an \ninstitution into processes and practices that ensure excellence and that a sustainable budget is created \naround excellence, as well. \nDuring the ensuing discussion, members expressed several comments and questions in relation to these \nissues, including, but not limited to:  whether the Deans will have unilateral authority to determine Faculty \ncore cuts; why there was not a request for staff to take a salary cut; clarification about the Ministry’s idea \nthat Campus Alberta equalizes all institutions; that professors are being improperly identified as the source \nof the budget problem at the University of Alberta; and speculation into scenarios next year, in relation to \nfunding. \nDISCUSSION ITEMS \n3. Academic Governance:  Moving Forward \nMaterials before members are contained in the official meeting file. \nPresenter: Indira Samarasekera, President and Chair, General Faculties Council (GFC) \nPurpose of the Discussion:  To engage the GFC Executive Committee and General Faculties Council \n(GFC) in a discussion with regard to the role and responsibilities of GFC and its standing committee \nsystem and to discuss the striking of a task force to review the Terms of Reference and activities of each \nGFC committee and provide recommendations for reform. \nDiscussion: \nDr Samarasekera noted that as President and Chair of General Faculties Council (GFC), she is interested \nin reviewing the GFC Standing Committee Terms of Reference, governance structure, and processes, as \nwell as the general scope of purview for each GFC Standing Committee in relation to administrative issues \nand responsibilities. \nShe noted that, first, there needs to be an effort to introduce debate into GFC, citing the value of large-\nscale, academy-wide discussions surrounding timely and relevant issues such as the re-opening of the \nPost-Secondary Learning Act (PSLA).  She suggested that perhaps such issues could be identified by the \nGFC Executive Committee initially and then placed on each GFC Agenda for debate and deliberation by \nCouncil members.  She added that a significant portion of time at GFC is spent approving routine items. \nShe reported that, secondly, the structure of the GFC Standing Committees contribute to onerous \nduplication of presentations and that there needs to be an effort to streamline the approval process for \nproposals moving through the governance system.  She noted that the private sector utilizes “consent \nagendas” and suggested that this might be an appropriate amendment to current practices at the University \nof Alberta. \nDr Samarasekera stated that, thirdly, there needs to be a review of each individual GFC Standing \nCommittee’s Terms of Reference to ensure that there is a distinction between governance and \nadministration. \nDr Samarasekera reported that her proposal to address these issues includes striking a GFC Task Force, \ncomprised of a small group of governance experts, who will review the current GFC Standing Committee \nGFC Executive Committee / 4/26/2013 \nPage 4 \nand GFC Terms of Reference, as well as their activities, to suggest reforms where necessary to invigorate \nand enrich the scope of the governance environment and ensure that there are effective processes and \npractices in place at a time when changes are imminent at the institution. She added that the group could \nwork over the summer and present its findings and recommendations to full GFC membership at the first \nCouncil meeting in the academic year 2013-2014. \nMr Chelen was invited to present a Students’ Union (SU) proposal, distributed for members’ review, \nentitled, “GFC ad hoc Subcommittee on Collegial Governance, Terms of Reference,” and he explained that \nthe proposal reflects a joint effort between the SU and the Graduate Students’ Association (GSA).   \nIn relation to Dr Samarasekera’s comments, Mr Chelen noted that students have arrived at similar \nconclusions about the governance process and structure, although his proposal suggests a broader task \nforce membership and a timeframe for the project which is longer to allow thorough review and University-\nwide consultation. \nMr Woods stated that GFC should be a forum to discuss and freely debate a large scope of issues and that \nno decisions should be made by a few people privately. \nMr Andrews suggested that students should be represented within the membership of the GFC Task \nForce.  \nDr Samarasekera stated that the purpose of the GFC Task Force is to provide a blueprint of how to take \nadministration out of governance and to review in a clinical fashion the GFC Standing Committees, adding \nthat timely, expert advice is essential in the current financial climate, to prove to the Board of Governors \nthat internal processes remain effective and efficient.  She explained that once this ‘audit’ is completed, \nGFC members will decide how to proceed. \nMs Haggarty-France reported that the last external review of the governance process and structure \noccurred in the early 2000s and that, at one point in the mid 1970s, there were 32 GFC Standing \nCommittees, as opposed to 11 currently.  She stated that the University of Alberta has one of the leanest \nacademic governance committee structures in Canada.  She stated that with the replenishment of the \nAssistant GFC Secretary position in University Governance, there has been increased opportunity to be \nmore strategic and effective.  She stated that it will be beneficial to review governance processes and \npractices and that this may provide further opportunity to educate the community about the different roles \nwithin governance and why each GFC Standing Committee has a distinct and separate mandate. \nDuring the ensuing discussion surrounding this issue, members expressed several comments and \nquestions, including, but not limited to:  clarification about how internal Department-level, Faculty-level, and \nsenior administrative committees add to the perception of a prolonged governance course; the methods \nand outcomes of the last GFC Standing Committee Terms of Reference review; that proposals seem overly \nvetted within the current governance structure; discussion about the proposed timeframe of the GFC Task \nForce; that due to over-exposure during the governance process, proposals and items for discussion seem \n‘fait accompli’ when presented at GFC meetings; that summer might not be the ideal time for the GFC Task \nForce to complete their work; that students should be part of the review process; that perhaps a small \ngroup, viewing things through an administrative lens, could review the GFC Standing Committee Terms of \nReference and then present a report for consultation within the governance structure; that the GFC \nStanding Committees require individual delegated authority to avoid duplication; that trust between the \ngovernance committees is a key issue; that certain GFC Standing Committee functions could be placed on-\nline; that the forum of GFC should include contentious debate, as currently practiced at Students’ Council; \nthat GFC lacks discussion on divisive issues and that Council votes are predictable; clarification about \nGFC Executive Committee / 4/26/2013 \nPage 5 \nwhether the GFC Task Force will be considered Presidential in its origin or rooted within the GFC \nExecutive Committee and/or another entity of the GFC Standing Committee reporting structure and the \nimplications of either entity of origin;  that members of the individual GFC Standing Committees are the \nbest group of experts to review the GFC Standing Committee Terms of Reference;  that though there is \nroom for more enriched discussions at GFC, the main mandate of GFC remains reviewing and/or \napproving items that have been refined through the existing governance processes; that the GFC Terms of \nReference should be reviewed prior to selecting topics for debate and discussion; that institutional support \nof this endeavor will require updates to members over the summer; and that there are too many GFC \nStanding Committees with complex Terms of Reference.    \nDr Samarasekera concluded that the GFC Task Force will be a Presidential task force and that she will \ntherefore begin to recruit members immediately.  She added that the subsequent report will be presented \nat the first GFC Executive Committee meeting of the 2013-2014 academic year.  She instructed members \nto continue to discuss issues that could be added to GFC Agendas for debate and discussion including the \nre-opening of the PSLA and Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between the Ministry of Enterprise and \nAdvanced Education (EAE) and the University of Alberta, as well as other relevant academy-wide issues. \n4.

Comments from the President \nPresident and Chair, Dr Indira Samarasekera, welcomed all to the 389th meeting of General Faculties \nCouncil (GFC) and reported:   \n On the retirement of several longstanding GFC members, notably Mr Gerry Kendal, University \nRegistrar, and Mr Ernie Ingles, Vice-Provost and Director, School of Library and Information \nStudies.  She thanked all departing members of GFC for their dedication and hard work. \n On the Provincial Government’s vision of Campus Alberta, the re-opening of the Post-Secondary \nLearning Act (PSLA), and a recent meeting with Mr Thomas Lukaszuk, Deputy Premier and Minister \nof Enterprise and Advanced Education (EAE).  She stated that she will be attempting to gather \nconcrete objectives from the Provincial Government surrounding their plans for Campus Alberta.  \nShe noted that the PSLA serves the University of Alberta well, and it may not be beneficial to re-\nopen it.  At the request of Dr Samarasekera, Acting Provost Dr Ferguson-Pell was invited to \ncomment on a recent meeting he had with Minister Lukaszuk.  He reported that during this meeting, \nthe Minister discussed results-based budgeting, plans for a possible institute that would foster \ncommercialization opportunities across Campus Alberta, potential changes to Alberta Innovates, re-\nGeneral Faculties Council / 6/3/2013 \nPage 4 \nopening the PSLA, and performance criteria for Campus Alberta.  He noted that the discussion did \nnot yield many specific details on these matters. \n On the Memorandum of Understanding (MOU). She reported that following a request from the \nAlberta Council of Presidents, citing the need for the document to be vetted through governance \nprocesses, the Ministry of EAE has agreed to move the deadline for completion of the MOU to \nOctober 31, 2013.  She noted that the University of Alberta will collaborate with fellow \nComprehensive Academic and Research Intensive (CARI) institutions of Alberta in completing \ncertain sections of the MOU and provided members with a governance timeline of a draft MOU \npresentation at the June 21, 2013 Board of Governors meeting, a first draft in July, and then \ndiscussion of the draft MOU at the September 16, 2013 GFC meeting, with an aim to submit a final \ndocument by the stated deadline of October 31, 2013.  She emphasized that the MOU will be a \ncondensed document.  She reminded members to monitor the posts on the University’s Colloquy \nblog for updates. \n On the Worldwide Universities Network (WUN).  She explained to Council that WUN is a group of \n19 research-intensive universities which collaborate on global research topics.  She reported that at \nthe recent WUN meeting, members discussed ideas surrounding the Network’s areas of focus:  \nclimate change, understanding cultures, higher education, and public health.  She noted that food \nsecurity was determined to be the next area of focus and that proposals would be prepared for \nconsideration by several international funding agencies. \nACTION ITEMS \n4.

He drew members’ attention to \nthe corresponding letters of support for the proposal and noted that programs and courses would not be \nnegatively impacted. \nMotion: Amaral/Molzahn \nTHAT General Faculties Council recommend to the Board of Governors the proposed merger of \nAugustana Faculty’s Department of Fine Arts and Department of Humanities into a single Department of \nFine Arts and Humanities, as submitted by the Dean of Augustana Faculty and as set forth in Attachment \n1, to take effect July 1, 2013.                                                                                                 \n                                                                                                                                                          CARRIED \nGeneral Faculties Council / 6/3/2013 \nPage 7 \nDISCUSSION ITEMS \n6. Academic Governance – Moving Forward \nMaterials before members are contained in the official meeting file. \nPresenter: Indira Samarasekera, President and Chair, GFC \nPurpose of the Discussion: For information. \nDiscussion: \nPresident Samarasekera explained to members that she will be creating an arm’s length GFC Task Force \nto review GFC and its Standing Committees, noting that the review will examine Terms of Reference for \nGFC and each GFC Standing Committee, compare them with the Terms of Reference and activities of \nother GFC Standing Committees, and ensure that there is a clear delineation between governance and \nadministration.  She stated that now is the time to ensure that processes at the University of Alberta are \nstreamlined, effective, and strategic, and she added that GFC should be a forum in which substantive \ndiscussions and debates occur.  She added that she hopes to decrease the level of repetition within the \ngovernance process, ensuring that members’ time is utilized efficiently in an environment when there is a \nneed to do more with fewer resources. \nShe reported that the GFC Task Force will be populated by two faculty members with expertise in \ngovernance as well as one graduate student representative who, similarly, has some expertise in this area.  \nShe stated that a report from the GFC Task Force will be presented to the GFC Executive Committee and \nto GFC in the Fall.  \nDuring the ensuing discussion, members expressed several comments and questions, including, but not \nlimited to:  that it is beneficial to routinely review governance processes for efficiency; clarification on \nwhether the University of Alberta has faculty members with an expertise in university governance; how the \nreview aligns with “Dare to Deliver”; clarification of the scope of the review; that GFC is seen by some to be \na “rubber stamp”; that the GFC Executive Committee retains a lot of power and is seen to be operating \nbeyond GFC; concern that some GFC Standing Committees report to the Board of Governors and, \nseemingly, not GFC; that all GFC Standing Committees should report directly to GFC; that the material on \nthis item, provided to members, did not contain information on the inclusion of the graduate student \nrepresentative on the GFC Task Force; a suggestion to include an undergraduate student representative \non the GFC Task Force; concern that the summer months would not be enough time to complete the \nreview; and clarification about the cross-over between administrative issues and governance. \nAt the conclusion of the discussion, Dr Samarasekera noted she was amenable to this Task Force \nincluding an undergraduate student representative. \n7. The Umbrella Committee (TUC) Report \nMaterials before members are contained in the official meeting file. \nPresenter: Martin Ferguson-Pell, Acting Provost and Vice-President (Academic) \nPurpose of the Discussion: For information. \nDiscussion: \nGeneral Faculties Council / 6/3/2013 \nPage 8 \n Dr Ferguson-Pell explained that ‘The Umbrella Committee (TUC) Report’ represents the final report for \nTUC, adding that the Strategic Initiatives Group (SIG), under the direction of its Chair, Dr Erasmus Okine \n(who was in attendance at this meeting of GFC), will address any remaining topics not considered by TUC \nduring the time in existence. He noted that all other matters are being considered by the Renaissance \nCommittee (REN). \nMembers expressed several comments and questions in relation to this item, including, but not limited to:  \nclarification with regard to the role of REN; and clarification about Central Administration’s plan to address \nthe issue of indirect costs of research. \nACTION ITEM \n8. Budget Principles (and Update) \nMaterials before members are contained in the official meeting file. \nPresenters:  Martin Ferguson-Pell, Acting Provost and Vice-President (Academic); Phyllis Clark, Vice \nPresident (Finance and Administration) \nPurpose of the Proposal:  Section 3(4)(a) of the GFC Academic Planning Committee (APC) Terms of \nReference on budget matters states that GFC APC is to “recommend to GFC on budget principles.” The \nbudget principles as recommended by GFC APC at its meeting of May 22, 2013 are attached for GFC’s \nconsideration. \nDiscussion: \nDr Ferguson-Pell explained to members that in an effort to provide clear guidelines for the University of \nAlberta to direct future academy-wide changes, a set of budget principles had been drafted. \nMembers expressed a number of comments and questions in relation to the budget principles, including, \nbut not limited to:  a suggestion to include the words “publicly funded” within principle 1; clarification about \nthe meaning of “demonstrable excellence”; a suggestion to amend punctuation within the document; that \nCentral Administration may not be able to minimize job losses because certain losses will be directed and \ndecided by individual Faculties; clarification about increasing international student enrolments but not the \nnumber of Canadian students; that Central Administration may have minimal control over increasing the \nnumber and quality of graduate students; clarification about how the costs of new initiatives will be weighed \nagainst the need to maintain existing programs and staff in the current financial climate; clarification about \ncommunicating with frequency and openness in relation to releasing each Faculty’s budget letter publicly; \nwhether Central Administration could release the budget letters to University of Alberta leaders “in \nconfidence”; a suggestion to include an “unintended consequences” clause into the principles; a suggestion \nto include a principle that might address increasing workload and changing working conditions for existing \nstaff; that there could be issues surrounding equity, as a large percentage of full professors are male; \nclarification about the details of determining Faculty-specific differential cuts; that the principles do not \ninclude information about process; clarification about what is being done to prepare for cuts in 2014-2015 \nand 2015-16; clarification about the future impact on tuition rates; and clarification about resource planning \nto ensure that international students maintain their health and wellness while at the University of Alberta. \nMembers discussed suggested revisions and the Mover and Seconder to the Motion before Council agreed \nto several ‘friendly amendments’ to the budget principles. \nMotion: Belosevic/Ingles \nGeneral Faculties Council / 6/3/2013 \nPage 9 \nTHAT General Faculties Council recommend to the Board of Governors the budget principles that will \nguide the University in developing the strategies that will enable the institution to achieve a sustainable \nbudget, as provided by the President’s Executive Committee and as set forth in Attachment 1, as \namended, to take effect upon final approval.                                                                    \n                                                                                                                                                          CARRIED \nDISCUSSION ITEM \n9.

Anchored in collaboration and consultation, it allows the \nUniversity to incorporate and harness the various ways the academy pursues its teaching, learning, \nresearch, and service missions. We all benefit from collegial governance; it is at the heart of our success as \nan institution.” \n- Dare to Deliver 2011-2015 \nI. Guiding Principles \nThis paper was created with the intent to stimulate discussion within the academy, especially among \nmembers of General Faculties Council (GFC), on how academic governance1 could be reformed to better \nalign with the following principles: \n• The University of Alberta is governed collegially, which is grounded in a belief that faculty, \nstudents, and administration should have equal opportunity to participate in decision-making \nprocesses. \n• GFC should inclusive of both administrators and members irrespective of the nature of their \naffiliation with the academy. \n• All members should have the ability to meaningfully participate in GFC \n• The University should make decisions that are informed by and respectful of the diverse \nperspectives in the academy \n• GFC should be able to make decisions and provide advice in a timely manner \nWhat follows is meant to stimulate reflection and conversation among members of the academy. This is \nnot an objective review of GFC, but rather an introspective reflection on academic governance.  \nThis discussion paper has been shared with members from AASUA, the GSA, NASA, and administration, \nand will be shared broadly with current members of GFC. Feedback is encouraged, especially on the below \nthree questions, and can be sent via email to vp.academic@su.ualberta.ca: \n• What are the roles of GFC at a research-intensive public university like the U of A? \n• What concerns or recommendations for reform are there for GFC at the U of A? \n1 Diverse definitions of governance are available in the context of higher-education governance, and these definitions may vary \nslightly depending on the nature of governance model practiced by the institution and / or the higher education system. For the \npurposes of this report, we adopt the governance definition provided in the OECD Report titled Tertiary Education for the \nKnowledge Society Vol. 1, Special Features: Governance, Funding, Quality by Paulo Santiago, Karine Tremblay, Ester Basri and Elena \nArnal (2008). Governance “encompasses the structures, relationships and processes through which, at both national and \ninstitutional levels, policies for tertiary education are developed, implemented and reviewed. Governance comprises a complex \nweb including the legislative framework, the characteristics of the institutions and how they relate to the whole system, how \nmoney is allocated to institutions and how they are accountable for the way it is spent, as well as less formal structures and \nrelationships which steer and influence behavior” (OECD 2008, p.68). \nAttachment 1\n   2\t\n• What concerns or advice is there surrounding the recommendations contained in this DRAFT \ndiscussion paper? \nIt cannot be overemphasized that this report is a draft – it will be revised based on feedback from the \nacademy, and highlighted in an appendix. Furthermore, this report is not intended to provide \nrecommendations that are a “silver bullet” to the issues discussed by students, GFC, or the President of \nthe University, but rather this report is intended to open discussion for incremental change as part of a \nbroader analysis of GFC. The final report will attempt to collate the feedback from the academy, and \nshould act as a resource along with Dr. Samarasekera’s GFC Audit as GFC decides how it wants to \nproceed with GFC reform.  \nWe acknowledge that the views in this discussion paper ultimately reflect the values and experiences of \nundergraduates at the academy. Through consultation and research, we have attempted to broaden the \npaper to reflect other diverse perspectives from the academy. We apologize in advance if anyone or any \ngroup has been left out from our research process, and welcome your feedback. \nII. Background \nOver the past three decades, the post-secondary education sector in Canada has experienced many \ndramatic changes characterized by the increasing public divestment in post-secondary institutions, rising \nenrolment, fierce competition for research dollars, rapid internationalization, massive transformation in \nteaching and learning led by technological advancements and so forth. The combination of these rapid \nchanges has pushed and pulled the post-secondary sector in various directions, and the University of \nAlberta is no different. In addition, these challenges are more often being met by the entire academy, and \nnot just by administrators, who have increasingly specialized in the nuanced management of higher \neducation and research institutions. Collectively the challenges that face universities and the increasing \nneed for specialized expertise among administration have, in a sense, rendered the tradition of collegial \ngovernance ineffective. As a consequence, voices of interest and concern from among rank and file faculty \nas well as graduate and undergraduate students can be easily ignored during the rapid evolution of the \nuniversity. Now, more than ever before, it is important to ensure that the mechanisms at place within an \nacademy, to ensure that all members are engaged and empowered to work towards the betterment of the \nUniversity, are current and relevant. It is also noteworthy that many Canadian universities, including the \nUniversity of Toronto, University of Calgary, Concordia University, and University of Northern British \nColumbia, have engaged in review of governance, internally and /or externally. \nThe University of Alberta has a bicameral governance structure as mandated by the Provincial \nGovernment through the Post-Secondary Learning Act (PSLA). The PSLA legislates that General Faculties \nCouncil at the University of Alberta is responsible for governing the academic affairs of the university. \nThis includes recommending to the Board the establishment of Faculties, Departments, and programs of \nstudy, creating policies respecting academic awards, admissions, and libraries, and exercising any power of \nFaculty Council. To this end, the PSLA mandates the inclusion of representatives from various \nconstituencies and members-at-large from the campus community, such as students, faculty, staff and \nadministrators in GFC to ensure that the legislative obligations of GFC are appropriately upheld. This \nmodel of collegial governance, which holds as vital the values of shared authority and interdependent \nresponsibility, is essential to ensuring that the academy’s voice is heard and that the University evolves to \nreflect the multitude of ways we achieve our mission of excellence in teaching, research, and service. \n   3\t\nHowever, in recent years there has been a sense of discontent among students, staff and faculty, about the \nnature in which decisions are being made regarding issues that affect the wider university community.  \nOn January 17, over a dozen undergraduate students wrote to the President with concerns over the \nprocess and structure of GFC. At the core of their letter was a sentiment that they didn’t feel welcome or \nvalued as members of the academy. The President responded and re-affirmed that students are essential to \na collegial academic governance model, while also acknowledging that GFC’s ability to engage the academy \ncould be enhanced. The Graduate Students’ Association (GSA) and the SU believed that GFC should be \nengaged in a discussion on its functioning, and proposed a GFC Collegial Governance Committee with \nbroad representation to make recommendations for reform. At the same time, the Office of the President \nof University of Alberta submitted the White Paper on General Faculties Council Reform, which proposed to \nundertake a review of GFC and its subcommittees to ensure “effective and efficient” functioning of the \nGFC system. The President chose to convene her GFC Audit Task Force with a mandate to “objectively \nreview of GFC committees’ structure and activities” in reference to each committee’s terms of reference \nand the PSLA, as well as to ensure that GFC and its subcommittee were not focused on issues that were \n“the responsibility of other committees or administrative offices”. The committee initially consisted of \nfaculty members from Business and Law, and later included an undergraduate and graduate student with \nacademic expertise in public governance. The Task Force is expected to present its findings and \nrecommendations before GFC for discussion in early 2014. \nWhile the Students’ Union sees value in an objective audit of General Faculties Council, we also believe \nthat the academy should also introspect on the context and challenges that face GFC. Indeed, it speaks \nvolumes about GFC’s struggle to enact its legislated responsibility over academic affairs if it cannot even \nreflect on its own structure and procedures. Therefore, as members with vested interest in GFC, the \nStudents’ Union believes that there is a need to empower GFC to engage in a review of the state of \nacademic governance at University of Alberta.  \nIII. Purpose \nA good governance system places equal emphasis on the structures of governance in place as well as the \nprinciples (i.e. the procedures and norms) by which such structures operate and communicate. Therefore, a \nreview of the state of academic governance must comprise of an assessment of both. To this end, the \nStudents’ Union at University of Alberta has prepared a report titled A Review of the State of Academic \nGovernance at the University of Alberta, which presents a review of academic governance from the \nundergraduate students’ perspective. To stimulate further discussion and deliberation, each of the \nfollowing sections will be accompanied by a set of recommendations for reform. The first set of \nrecommendations reviews procedures that guide operations and communications of GFC and its \ncommittees. The purpose of the second set of recommendations is to examine the scope and nature of \nactivities undertaken by GFC – as mandated by the PSLA - and in comparison to that of GFC equivalents \nat other Canadian peer institutions to explicitly identify issues within GFC mandate and recognize the \nextent of that mandate.   \nTwo factors form the underlying rationale for undertaking this project; further, these factors are also \nimportant in understanding the Students’ Union’s research approach to this project. To begin with, \nacademic governance at University of Alberta is under the purview of GFC as mandated by the Post-\nSecondary Learning Act. Student representation and participation in GFC is further required by the PSLA. \nNevertheless, the Act does not set any expectations of periodic assessment of the performance of GFC, \nwhether the procedures that guide the activities at GFC or the nature and structure of GFC. In other \nwords, no guidelines or rules exist that seek to evaluate the extent of meaningful engagement and genuine \n   4\t\nparticipation of GFC members.  In this sense, the GFC is left to its own devices to evaluate and identify \nfactors that may enhance or limit member engagement and participation in the decision-making processes \nthat characterize the shared governance structure represented by GFC.  \nAdditionally, over the years, undergraduate student members of GFC have expressed their thoughts and \nopinions on GFC, during informal and internal conversations within the Students’ Union (and formally at \nGFC on different occasions) that focused on the challenges and barriers undergraduates face in being \nactive members of GFC as well as the opportunities they try to seek utilize, as and when available at GFC, \nto enhance the extent of engagement they can have in decision making processes. Many of these \nconversations have revolved around procedural matters. Despite identifying ongoing challenges to \nundergraduate participation at GFC, students have at the same time maintained their faith in the platform \nGFC provides as a shared decision making body on issues that are especially relevant to undergraduates at \nthe University of Alberta. In the same spirit, they have also recognized the need to examine the current \nstatus quo and identify and support ways to reinforce GFC as the focal point of academic governance \nmechanism, propel its dynamism as a deliberative body, and strengthen its accountability to members of \nthe academy. However, the informal nature of these conversations and lack of systematic documentation \ncreated a need for a comprehensive research plan. \nIV. Research process \n[to come] \nV. Recommendations \nPart I: Recommendations for Reforming Governance Procedures \nFollowing is a set of 9 recommendations that address diverse dimensions of governance procedures practiced by GFC \nat the University of Alberta. These recommendations emerge from several formal and informal discussions \nwith past and current GFC undergraduate student representatives about their experiences of representing \nand serving the University of Alberta. \nIt is worth acknowledging that these recommendations may resonate with a wider group of campus \nstakeholders, especially faculty and graduate students, who by virtue of not being in administrative roles, \nrely heavily on governance processes and practices at GFC to increase their knowledge and understanding \nas well as participate in decision making processes on important academic and student affairs issues on all \nfive campuses of the University of Alberta.  \n1. Revitalize GFC as the venue for debate and discussion on topics of importance to the academy \nThe GFC at University of Alberta represents the center-stage for decision making on all academic and \nstudent affairs issues that affect the academy in its entirety. Despite having delegated some of its \nauthority, as part of its PSLA derived mandate, to a variety of subcommittees, it must remain the venue \nfor discussion and debate on proposals and decisions forwarded to it by its subcommittee. To ensure that \nGFC members are provided with adequate opportunity to acquaint themselves with multiple massively complex, \ncrosscutting issues occurring in parallel but addressed by GFC subcommittees individually, it is recommended that: \na. The frequency of GFC meeting is changed from the existing once a month schedule to be held \nevery two weeks to maintain continuity that is often lost in the course of a month long gap, and \nto allow for more frequent discussions and debates on important issues. \nb. GFC meetings be held on a Tuesday or Thursday of the week for one hour and thirty minutes \nduring a scheduled class block, instead of a two hour session on Monday that overlaps two one \n   5\t\nhour scheduled classes. This will allow for increased participation of students and teaching \nfaculty who otherwise have to choose between attending class and having a voice.  \nc. The GFC meeting be video recorded and / or live-streamed to allow absentee members to stay \nup to date with events and discussion at missed GFC meetings. This will also allow for \nmembers of the University community who are not members of GFC to observe the meetings \nand be informed of issues that affect the institution as a whole.  \n2. Empower newly elected members and aid in transition to foster effective engagement \nIn fulfilling its purpose of overseeing the academic affairs of the academy, the GFC expects each \nmember to use good judgment, act responsibly and ethically, and participate to the fullest of their \npotential in governing the University. Some members of GFC are disadvantaged by the fact that they \nhave only recently become a part of the University community, and this is most true with students. To \nensure that the GFC and its individual members are effectively undertaking the roles and responsibilities referred to in the \nGFC term of reference, are able to fully participate and meaningfully contribute to the dialogue at GFC, it is \nrecommended that: \na. With the assistance of University Governance, the Chair of GFC and its subcommittees submit \na written report at the end of each academic year that highlights substantive items discussed or \napproved, as well as items that are likely to come forward in the future. These reports should \nbe clearly available on the University Governance website at all times. \nb. The annual reports submitted by Chairs of GFC and its subcommittee shall be discussed at the \nfirst GFC meeting of the academic year (i.e. in September) to stimulate discussion, to ensure \naccountability, to ensure checks and balances in authority delegation and as well, to allow new \nmembers an opportunity to fully understand past activities and ongoing issues considered by \nGFC and its subcommittee during the year before.   \n3. Create a culture of inclusivity and joint-ownership \nThe PSLA requires participation and representation from diverse representative groups at the \nUniversity of Alberta: students, faculty, staff and administrators of the academy. In doing so, the PSLA \nrecognizes the distinct contribution each representative group stands to make to the academy and thus, \naffirms its commitment to allow these groups a voice in the decision making processes that guide this \ninstitution. In recognizing the sprit of this belief, the university has a responsibility to ensure that all stakeholder \ngroups can effectively and equitably fulfill their legislative obligation, and so it is recommended that: \na. The President of the University and Chair of the GFC present a welcoming commentary at the \nonset of the academic year which commemorates the significance and vitality of GFC to the \ninstitutional community and reminds all stakeholder groups and representatives of their \nobligation to actively participate in dialogues at GFC, irrespective of whether they arrive at the \nUniversity as learners, teachers, or managers.  \nb. Nametags be created for display during all GFC sessions for all counselors, devoid of formal \ndesignation at the academy, which allows the Chair and members to address each other by \nname, acknowledging that all GFC members are first and foremost individuals. \nc. Letters be issued by the University of Alberta President’s Office attesting to the work of \nstudent members of  GFC for the pertinent academic year, as part of a University Academic \nAccommodation Policy, to be used by students to excuse themselves from coursework on days \nand times when GFC meetings are scheduled. \n4. Encourage leadership of a supportive and inclusive environment for committee dialogue \n   6\t\nThe Chairs of GFC and GFC committees play a crucial role in guiding and facilitating the Council and \ncommittees’ deliberations on important issues, ensuring that all voting members are able to present \ntheir concerns and comments on issues in the manner suggested in GFC and its committees’ terms of \nreferences. Given that this facilitator role as Chair of GFC has both the power and the responsibility to uphold the \nvalues of collegial governance that the University espouses, it is recommended that:  \na. The Chairs of GFC and its committees regularly encourage the committee to reflect on the \nprinciples of collegiality as well as the committee terms of reference to ensure that \nconversations remain in-scope and constructive.  \nb. The Chair of GFC and its committees safeguard practices of good governance – such as \ncreating the agenda, amending the agenda after approval of committee members, and providing \nsupporting documentation for agenda items within the allotted timeline - that are fundamental \nto ensuring fair functioning of the committee. Further, in rare cases when decisions are made \nbased on precedence, ensure that documentation of such precedence is appropriately cited and \nmade available to all voting members of the committee prior to making a final decision.  \nc. University Governance provide Chairs of GFC and its committees with resources on effective \nand equitable meeting facilitation that acknowledges the diverse perspectives and contexts \nwhich committee members bring to the table. \n5. Adopt clear, concise and useful outlines of issue \nThe “outline of issue” attached before documents accompanying items in the agenda forms an \nimportant and comprehensive source of information for GFC and its committee members to \nunderstand the issue, assess its scope and direct and indirect impact on them and the academy, identify \nthe office that has authority over the issue, consultations on the issue that have occurred or are yet to \noccur, the governance route the issue will follow and so forth. However, very frequently, the ‘purpose’ \nand ‘impact’ sections of the outline of issue are unpolished, leaving readers with insufficient knowledge \nof the implications of the issue / proposal. Similarly, while the routing section indicates the \nconsultative route the proposal has taken, it doesn’t capture a comprehensive summary of changes the \nproposal may have undergone, which does not allow GFC and its committee members to fathom the \nfull scope of alterations the proposal has witnessed. Finally, for issues that are introduced for purely \ndiscussion purposes and where members have no authority to make modifications, an overly \ncomplicated outline of issue results in redundancy. Outlines of issue should provide members with extensive time \ndemands to quickly grasp the content, implications, and concerns behind an item. Hence, it is recommended that, \na. The GFC Secretary ensure that purpose and impact sections of the outlines of issue are \ncomprehensive to ensure that all GFC members, irrespective of their familiarity with the issue, \nare able to accurately assess the true impact of the agenda item.  \nb. The approval routing section in outline of issues be more enhanced to show members of GFC \nany substantive changes made to issues as they make their way through the governance system.  \nc. GFC adopt a simplified outline of issue for items that are solely brought forward for \ndiscussion, to reduce procedural overload and members are more easily able to consult the \nacademy on a topic. \n6. Enhance minutes reporting and adopt early circulation practices \nThe minutes captured at GFC and its committee meetings are the official record of discussions and \ndeliberations on a multitude of issues considered at GFC and its committees. The discussions that \nprecede a final vote and decision on a matter are essential in understanding the growth of the \nUniversity, and provide a valuable record of the diverse perspectives of the academy. Minutes are \ngenerally circulated a week before the scheduled meetings. However, the reporting of the meeting \n   7\t\nminutes – devoid of any identifying information about the speaker – seldom captures the spirit of the \ndebates. Further, given the three-week gap (and longer during summer months and winter break) in circulation of \nminutes post the actual occurrence of meetings artificially stalls continuous thought and conversations (outside the \ncommittee) on key issues. Thus it is recommended that: \na. GFC and its committees move back to more comprehensive meeting minutes, which not only \ncaptures the spirit of the meeting, but also includes an identification of representative \ndesignation of the speaking member, along with any action items that arise through the course \nof a meeting. \nb. Draft minutes be circulated earlier to allow members to reflect upon them while they are still \nmindful of recent in-session committee discussions and to allow for conversations to continue \noutside committees. \nc. Minutes be recorded and circulated for all standing subcommittees of GFC committees, which \nincludes the Academic Standard Committee Subcommittee on Standards (ASC SOS) to ensure \ntransparency and continuity of inter-committee flow of information.  \n7. Establish a culture of easy-to-access records  \nUniversity Governance maintains the official record of all meeting materials and minutes of \ndiscussions as part of GFC and its committees’ activities and these are available to be accessed publicly \nupon a request submitted to the GFC Secretary (except those records with implications under FOIPP \nregulations). The importance of these materials in helping a member to acquaint themselves with past \ndeliberations and course of actions undertaken on important issues examined at GFC or one of its \ncommittees, in evaluating rationales for precedence based decision making, or simply as a reference \nmaterial to inform a better understanding of the activities undertaken by GFC cannot be stressed \nsufficiently. However, as a higher education instruction committed to both the generation and preservation of \nknowledge, to ensure that our governance resources are accessible and preserved for members to access, it is \nrecommended that  \na. University Governance create an online archive for storing all meeting materials for GFC and \nits committee meetings, including submissions related to written questions and responses that \nare normally included in GFC meeting materials. Such an archive would have historical \ndocuments accessible separately and appropriately titled for greater searchability. \nb. Further, University Governance investigate a system of online cataloguing and tagging that will \nallow for seamless issue tracking to aid in new member Orientation, future research on prior \ndiscussions and decisions, and to allow members to watch how issues may have entered, \nevolved, and exited the governance routes.  \n8. Educate GFC members on the role of the GFC Secretary \nAccording to the terms of reference of GFC, a primary responsibility of the GFC Secretary is “to serve \nthe General Faculties Council and its Executive Committee as Secretary by arranging all meetings, \npreparing agendas and ensuring that comprehensive documentation, including an outline of the issues, \nis distributed.”2 However, misconceptions and lack of knowledge exist among GFC student members about the role \nof the GFC Secretary and the accompanying mandate to serve all members of GFC particularly in acting as a \n2 As indicated on pg. 12 of the GFC Terms of Reference available on the GFC webpage hosted by University Governance, \nUniversity of Alberta. See here: \nhttp://www.governance.ualberta.ca/GeneralFacultiesCouncil/~/media/Governance/Documents/GO01/TER/General-\nFaculties-Council.pdf \n   8\t\n“resource person where information may be obtained on any matters, which fall within the purview of \nGeneral Faculties Council”3. It is recommended that: \na. At the start of the academic year, the University Secretary undertake activities to explicitly \neducate those new to GFC on the Secretary’s role and mandate to serve as an impartial \nresource person to the entire GFC, with respect to questions, concerns and comments relating \nto any matter under the purview of GFC. \n9. Introduce systematic evaluations to improve operations and communication of GFC and its \ncommittees \nIn fulfilling its purpose of overseeing the academic affairs of the academy, GFC should have the tools \nto regularly engage in self-reflection and enhancement to adapt to rapidly changing needs and \ncircumstances. To provide GFC with the information that allows for continuous improvement that responds to the \nneeds of its members, it is recommended that: \na. The University Secretary develops a survey tool for annual governance evaluations for GFC \nand its committees. The survey would be to gather feedback from members on the efficiency \nof operations and communication of GFC and its committees, with an aim to enhance \nmembers’ ability to wholly engage and participate in dialogue.  \nb. The findings and insights from a member survey are presented at the last meeting of GFC for \nthe academic year along with a brief report identifying next steps.  \nPart II: Recommendations for Governance Structures \n1. Make explicit the role of Libraries in the Committee on the Learning Environment \nWhile the University of British Columbia, the University of Manitoba, McGill, and Queen’s all have \nGFC standing committees specifically to address issues related to libraries, the University of Alberta \nGFC lacks clarity on where library-related issues might be addressed. While the PSLA Section 26(1)(k) \nindicates that GFC is responsible for making “rules and regulations for the management and \noperations of the libraries,” it is not clear from a review of the terms of references of GFC committees \nas to which committee oversees library related issues. Libraries are quintessential in supporting the \nUniversity’s strategic and academic priorities and how libraries allocate resources to address strategic \npriorities has significant bearing on the scholarly environment for students and faculty. Even more so \nthan before, the rapid changes in learning approaches and practices accompanied by advancements in \ntechnology and digitization requires that serious consideration be given to discussing the library’s \nchanging role in the life of the academy. In 2004, the Teaching and Learning Committee and the \nLibraries Committee merged to form the Committee on the Learning Environment, however the terms \nof reference of CLE don’t fully reflect the role of Libraries in the learning environment. The mandate to \ngovern libraries, particularly in areas of strategic initiatives and resource planning for research and learning tools, closely \nfit within CLE mandate and intended purpose. Therefore, it is recommended that  \na. The Terms of Reference of CLE be amended to include the governance of libraries, including \nuniversity-wide library policy, library strategic planning, and discussions on new developments \nin academic libraries including copyright and open access policies. \nb. Library policy respecting users of the libraries be transitioned into UAPPOL \n3 Ibid. pg. 13. \n   9\t\nc. CLE membership include an elected librarian \n2. Enhance awareness, discussion, and governance of the University’s excellent research \nenterprise \nA number of Canadian peer institutions have standing committees of GFC to govern and deliberate \non issues impacting research and scholarly activity. While a University Research and Policy Committee \n(URPC) exists under the mandate of the office of Vice-President (Research), the URPC does not fall \nwithin the direct purview of academic governance per se. Issues impacting the University’s research \nmandate typically enter governance through APC before being passed to the Board Learning and \nDiscovery Committee. To enhance the academy’s awareness of and ability to govern research policy, without adding to \nthe burden of members of the academy, it is recommended that: \na. The GFC Committee on the Learning Environment mandate include issues and policy \nrespecting research, museums and collections, and centers and institutes, as delegated by APC. \n3. Rethink the governance of teaching awards as policy guided by CLE instead of a committee \nguided by GFC \nThe University of Alberta is the only U13 member that governs teaching awards through a separate \ncommittee. In order to reduce the number of committees of GFC to allow for a leaner and more \nefficient governance body, the academy should consider transitioning UTAC’s terms of reference into \na policy, that the Committee on the Learning Environment would be responsible for. To reduce the \nnumber of committees that University Governance supports without impacting the integrity of the selection process it, is \nrecommended that: \na. The GFC Committee on the Learning Environment be given the power to approve policy \nrespecting major teaching awards. \nb. The University Teaching Awards Committee be disbanded as a GFC subcommittee, with the \nprinciples contained in its Terms of Reference being transitioned into a UAPPOL policy on \nSelection of Major Teaching Awards. \n4. Govern standards, quality, and enrolment through a revised Academic Programs and \nStandards Committee \nAs suggested by current Canadian research, academic governance needs to play an increased role in \ngoverning the quality of student programs at an undergraduate and graduate level4. The Academic \nStandards Committee and Subcommittee on Standards have responsibility for admission, transfer, \ncourse-change, certificates, and academic standard policies, and share responsibility for grading, \nenrolment, examinations, and programs of study. The Academic Standards Committee should \nfunction as the primary academic standards and program governing body, and should have a \nmembership that is representative of the diversity of academic program stakeholders. In order to refocus \non the quality, management, and strategy of academic programs, instead of the management, it is recommended that: \n4 Jones, Glen A. (2013). “Governing Quality: Positioning Student Learning as a Core Objective of Institutional and System-\nLevel Governance.” Keynote paper presented at the International Conference on Higher Education Student Learning and \nDevelopment in a Globalizing Time, hosted by the Institute of Education, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China, October 27-28, \n2013. \n   10\t\na. The existing administrative membership of ASC transition into Associate Dean’s Council, an \nadvisory body to the Provost’s Office.  \nb. The Academic Standards Committee evolve into an Academic Programs and Standards \nCommittee, with responsibility certificates, admission, transfer, and course-changes. \nc. Membership of APSC reflect a diverse array of stakeholders including Deans, Chairs, the \nProvost’s Office, the Registrar’s Office, constituency associations, students, faculty, and FGSR. \nd. APSC be delegated authority on academic programs, examinations, grading, and enrolment \nmanagement, to allow it to consider strategic directions, program quality, and program \nstandards, and make recommendations directly to GFC or the Board of Governors.  \ne. Enrolment management policies be updated and UAPPOLized to allow the APSC to engage in \ndiscussions on program size, quality, and strategy in an informed and valued manner. \nf. As per the advice of the Provost’s Task Force on Student Financial Aid, APSC should include \nin its mandate the oversight of strategic enrolment management tools like merit- and need-\nbased aid. \ng. Govern student awards through APSC, through creating and overseeing UAPPOL policy and \nprocedures that empower the RO and University Advancement to manage student \nscholarships and bursaries. \n5. Trans-disciplinary governance \nThe University of Alberta operates in a uniquely decentralized manner, which has a number of \nstrengths. For central academic governance, however, it means that initiatives or issues may pass by \nGFC, thus leaving discussions without a comprehensive perspective. Section 29(1) of PSLA, which \ndefines the powers of Faculty Councils, indicates that they have the authority to govern academic \nmatters within a faculty, especially those related to student admission and withdrawal, program of \nstudy, conduct of examination including appointment of examiners, and authorization of granting of \ndegree. Generally, Deans as administrative heads of the faculties and as chairs of Faculty Councils \nreport to the Provost and Vice-President (Academic). However, multiple provisions within section \n26(1)(b), (c)(h) and (i) provide GFC the ultimate governing authority over decisions made by FCs. In \nother words, Faculty Councils function under delegated authority from the GFC and are therefore \nwithin the purview of governing responsibilities shared by GFC members. However, annual reports \nprovided by Deans to the Provost office are seldom discussed at GFC, which leaves GFC members \nwith incomplete understanding of academic activities and strategic initiatives (especially academic \nprogram renewal) within the Faculty Councils that stand to potentially affect the overall quality of \nacademic experience of students at University of Alberta. Therefore it is recommended that,  \na. GFC, as per its PSLA mandate, require Faculty Council annual reports be included as \ninformation items to GFC akin to the mid-term assessment updates of Dare to Discover, and be \nincluded in the governance orientation files at the beginning of the academic year.  \n6. Delegate authority in responsible, clear, and flexible ways \nAll GFC standing committees function on delegated authority from GFC indicating that the power to \nevaluate the delegation of authority rests ultimately with GFC. To ensure that GFC and its standing \ncommittees continue to serve the mandate among the many rapid changes affecting the academy on a regular basis (and \ngiven the changing times facing the higher education section), it is recommended that \na. The University Secretary track delegated authority by PSLA-mandated activity, as well as by \ncommonly occurring issues (eg. program approvals) and make this information available on \n   11\t\nGFC’s website and annual to members in the GFC orientation materials.  \nb. The terms of reference of each subcommittee be reviewed so that important, divisive, or \nstrategic issues be forwarded to GFC, as either the final approver or before moving to the \nBoard of Governors.  \nc. To combat long agendas, GFC should operate with “consent” agendas so that items forwarded \nfrom ASC, APC, FDC, and Exec are discussed or voted upon only if a GFC member requests \nto do so in advance of the meeting. \nd. A clear process be developed by GFC that allows it to review and un-delegate authority from \nstanding committees in situations where the matter–in-question is potentially significant \nbeyond the narrowly defined scope of the standing GFC committee in which it is typically \ndiscussed.  \n7. Where overlap exists, ensure effective communication from the Board to GFC, and vice-versa \nWhile academic governance is exclusively within the scope of PSLA mandated activities of GFC, many \ndecisions and policies made by Board of Governors (BoG) stand to directly and/or indirectly impact \nacademic affairs at the academy. This necessitates that BoG, many of whom are not internal members of the \nacademy, are better informed and educated on the issues addressed by GFC as well as cognizant of how may their \ndecisions have impact beyond financial, human resource or purely administrative responsibilities at the University. It is \nrecommended that \na. The GFC presents highlights of key decisions on academic issues on a semester basis before \nthe BoG as discussion items. These presentations should be accompanied by oral updates from \nthe elected representative on the Board from GFC.  \nb. Decisions by the Board, including amendments made to decisions from GFC or one of its \nsubcommittees be circulated as an information item back to GFC. \nc. Joint retreats be organized between GFC and the BoG members, once a semester, to allow for \ninformal exchange, sharing of information and learning to create an open, closer and more \nresponsive culture of governance. \nIV.

Approval of the Agenda  \nMaterials before members are contained in the official meeting file. \nPresenter: Carl Amrhein, Provost and Vice-President (Academic) and Chair, GFC Executive Committee \nDiscussion: \nThe Chair reported that, given the nature of the discussion at the February 3, 2014 General Faculties \nCouncil (GFC) meeting surrounding the approval route with regard to proposed establishment of a Fall \nTerm Reading Week (Green and Gold Week) and given the introduction of such a week has such far-\nreaching implications for the University of Alberta, as ‘Approver’ of changes to the UAPPOL Academic \nSchedule Procedure, he had decided he would seek the advice and formal endorsement of the proposal by \nGFC Executive Committee 03/13/2014 \nPage 2 \nGFC members at the Council meeting of March 24, 2014.  Dr Amrhein, therefore, proposed an amendment \nto the Agenda for today’s meeting to include as an item for discussion the inclusion of the Fall Term \nReading Week proposal on the Agenda for the GFC meeting of March 24, 2014. \nThe Chair also noted that Item 4: ‘Discussion on General Faculties Council (GFC) Governance’ would be \nremoved from today’s Agenda as members of the GFC Task Force had declined an invitation to attend the \nmeeting.  He distributed a memorandum authored by members of the GFC Task Force to the GFC \nExecutive Committee which provided detail on work they had completed to date and the anticipated \ncompletion date of the Task Force’s report. \nMotion:  Patten/Rodgers \nTHAT the GFC Executive Committee approve the Agenda, as amended. \nCARRIED \n2. Approval of the Open Session Minutes of March 5, 2014  \nMaterials before members are contained in the official meeting file \nPresenter: Carl Amrhein, Provost and Vice-President (Academic) and Chair, GFC Executive Committee \nMotion: Nocente/Robertson \nTHAT the GFC Executive Committee approve the Minutes of March 5, 2014. \nCARRIED \n3. Comments from the Chair  \nAt this point in the meeting, Dr Amrhein stepped out of the chair, and Dr Yonge assumed the chair on his \nbehalf, thereby allowing him to freely participate in the discussion of Agenda Item 5:  ‘Students’ Union (SU) \nDiscussion Paper on General Faculties Council (GFC)’.  Dr Amrhein had no additional comments. \nDISCUSSION ITEMS \n4. Students’ Union (SU) Discussion Paper on General Faculties Council (GFC)  \nMaterials before members are contained in the official meeting file. \nPresenter: Dustin Chelen, Vice-President (Academic), Students’ Union (SU) \nPurpose of the Proposal: To stimulate thought and discussion among members of General Faculties \nCouncil (GFC) on the processes and structure underlying GFC, in advance of the presentation of President \nSamarasekera’s audit of GFC. This discussion allows the Students’ Union to continue to seek feedback on \nits Discussion Paper on the State of Academic Governance at the University of Alberta and for members of \nGFC to share their perspectives and ideas with both the SU and the President’s Task Force. \nDiscussion: \nUpon invitation from the Acting Chair, Mr Bodnar provided members with a brief overview regarding past \nreviews of GFC since its inception.  He noted, in particular, that the last comprehensive review of GFC had \nbeen undertaken in the mid 2000s.  He stated that, as a major push leading to the eventual \ndecommissioning of the GFC Policy Manual, the Terms of Reference for all of GFC Standing Committees \nGFC Executive Committee 03/13/2014 \nPage 3 \nwere reviewed in detail throughout the period 2007 to early 2009, with GFC approving a series of revisions \nto these Terms during that time. \nMr Chelen was invited to introduce the Students’ Union (SU) Discussion Paper.  He began by thanking \nmembers for their consideration of it.  He explained that, when the issue of how the University governs \nitself was brought up at the April 26, 2013 meeting of the GFC Executive Committee, he was inspired to \ninvestigate this matter further.  While the GFC Task Force was established by the President to complete its \nown review, the SU wanted to further examine GFC’s procedures and processes and how the academic \ngoverning body handled larger institutional issues.  He noted that the SU attempted to gather feedback on \nthese issues from GFC members and emphasized that the SU Discussion Paper was intended to stimulate \na discussion surrounding the topic of academic governance at the University of Alberta and was meant to \ncomplement the work undertaken by the GFC Task Force.   \nDuring the extensive discussion that ensued, members expressed a number of comments and questions, \nincluding, but not limited to:  clarification surrounding whether the discussion today would focus on the \nmerits of the SU Discussion Paper or on whether the SU Discussion Paper was to be confirmed as an item \nfor the GFC Agenda for March 24, 2014; whether the actual size of GFC is changeable; clarification \nregarding the contents and intent of the GFC Task Force report, since the report has not yet been \nreleased; that there is no way to judge whether the contents of the SU Discussion Paper are \ncomplementary to the GFC Task Force report, since it has not been released; clarification regarding the \nresearch process utilized by the SU while drafting their Discussion Paper; that the SU Discussion Paper is \nincomplete due to the lack of data within it and, as such, that it should not be brought forward to GFC in \nthis state; that the research content is critical in a report such as this; an expression of support for GFC to \nreview this document; clarification surrounding the purpose of the document in terms of future action from \nGFC; clarification regarding the scope of the consultation process undertaken by the SU in preparing the \nDiscussion Paper; that the recommendations within the SU Discussion Paper create problematic \njurisdictional issues in relation to the authority granted to the institution within the Alberta Post-Secondary \nLearning Act (PSLA) and, more specifically, the role of the Board of Governors vis-à-vis GFC; that GFC is \nthe voice of the academy; a reminder of the bi-cameral system of shared governance at the institution and \na note of caution against assigning all authority with regard to institutional academic governance to GFC \nalone, given the overarching role play by the Board of Governors; that the ‘tones’ of individual discussions \nheld at GFC are separate from the actual functions of GFC; that there is no evidence behind the statement \nwithin the SU Discussion Paper that GFC is struggling to enact its own legislated responsibility and reflect \non its own structure and procedure; that the current member composition of GFC represents a balanced \nvoice; that the senior standing committees of GFC provide unique forums for enacting big ideas, in \ncomparison to Faculty-based initiatives; and expressions of concern with a number of the statements within \nthe SU Discussion Paper;  \nDiscussion continued with members raising, amongst others, the following points:  that even though GFC \nmust self-govern, it would not be appropriate for GFC to discuss an incomplete report and that the SU \nDiscussion Paper, in its current form, would not provide a quality discussion at GFC; concerns that some of \nthe items within the SU Discussion Paper relate to administration and the manner in which University \nGovernance performs its duties and responsibilities; that some of the concepts highlighted within the SU \nDiscussion Paper are exceedingly high level in nature; that there is a considerable body of research and \nliterature within Canada regarding the topic of academic governance and that there are certain recurring \nthemes within this arena relating to reform, jurisdiction, and whether the role of academic senates is being \ndiminished; that there needs to be a productive discussion surrounding these issues but, currently, there is \nno clear path to attaining that productivity; that a productive discussion requires a great deal of effort to \nensuring the issues are framed appropriately; that GFC should be responsible for deciding what to do \nfollowing any discussions on this topic; expressions of concern with taking this discussion to GFC at the \npresent time; that, despite the issues surrounding timing and the expiration of GFC student members’ \nGFC Executive Committee 03/13/2014 \nPage 4 \nterms on GFC, the main priority and focus should be on how to conduct such a crucial and impactful \ndiscussion for the institution; support for removing the Discussion Paper from the March 24, 2014 GFC \nAgenda; that the SU Discussion Paper contains problematic issues related to both the accountability and \nresponsibilities of GFC members; that certain past issues revisited within the SU Discussion Paper weigh it \ndown; that the current discussion illustrates the need for this discussion to occur at GFC; and an \nexpression of hope that the GFC Task Force report also undergoes similar discussion and scrutiny by \nmembers, upon its release. \nFurther, members discussed:  an acknowledgement of the importance of constituency groups at GFC; that \nthe student voice on GFC is important; clarification surrounding the impetus for drafting in the first place the \nSU Discussion Paper, with reference to issues that were raised by students at past GFC meetings (eg, \nissues regarding Lister Residences); the need to identify real issues of reform at GFC; that the  GFC Task \nForce did elicit feedback from individual Faculties (and their GFC members) via an e-mail distributed to and \nthrough each Dean; that there is no disadvantage to taking the SU Discussion Paper to GFC for \ndiscussion; that the SU Discussion Paper is incomplete and that it does not provide a strong enough \nrationale for the problems outlined within it; that the SU Discussion Paper contains a disingenuous tone; \nthat student participation at GFC appears to be robust; a suggestion for the SU Discussion Paper and the \nGFC Task Force’s report to be included on the same GFC Agenda for discussion; a suggestion for the \nmembers of the GFC Task Force to consult with members of the SU; and, finally, clarification about the \ngovernance route for the GFC Task Force report. \nA member proposed a Motion to remove the SU Discussion Paper on General Faculties Council (GFC) \nfrom the GFC Agenda of March 24, 2014. \nMr Chelen thanked members for their feedback and thoughtful commentary on the SU Discussion Paper \nand, in noting that his term as the SU’s Vice-President (Academic) was about to expire, stated this project \nwould be passed down to his successor in the role. \nIn response to the Acting Chair’s summary of what she had heard during the preceding discussion, a \nmember expressed his opinion that the Acting Chair should not summarize members’ comments before the \nCommittee’s pending vote on a Motion. \nA member called the Question. \nMotion:  Patten/White                       (Opposed:  Chelen and Kochikuzhyil) \nTHAT the GFC Executive Committee remove the Students’ Union (SU) Discussion Paper on General \nFaculties Council (GFC) from the Agenda for the March 24, 2014 meeting of GFC. \nCARRIED \n5. Fall Term Reading Week (Green and Gold Week) \nThere were no documents. \nPresenter: Carl Amrhein, Provost and Vice-President (Academic) and Chair, GFC Executive Committee \nPurpose of the Proposal: For information/discussion. \nDiscussion: \nDr Amrhein asked members to consider including a formal vote of endorsement on the Student’s Union’s \n(SU’s) Fall Term Reading Week (Green and Gold Week) proposal at the March 24, 2014 meeting of \nGFC Executive Committee 03/13/2014 \nPage 5 \nGeneral Faculties Council (GFC), despite his sole delegated authority over amendments to the UAPPOL \nAcademic Schedule Procedure which would result in the establishment of this week.  He cited examples of \npast votes of endorsement at GFC and briefly outlined some of the other options for consideration, \nincluding the revocation of his delegated authority on the issue.  He stated that the University’s Office of \nGeneral Counsel has been working through some of the potential legal and procedural aspects of the \ndetails inherent in such a request. \nMs Haggarty-France explained that the Post-Secondary Learning Act (PSLA) gives GFC authority over the \nAcademic Schedule and that GFC had delegated that authority to the GFC Executive Committee, which \napproves the annual Schedule in the Fall of each year.  She noted that, in comparison, the GFC Executive \nCommittee had delegated the authority over amendments to the Academic Schedule Procedure to the \nProvost and Vice-President (Academic).   \nDuring the discussion surrounding the Provost’s request, members expressed a number of comments and \nquestions, including, but not limited to:  that due to the difficulties surrounding revocation of the existing \ndelegation, a vote at GFC should be advisory in nature; that GFC members are already well prepared for \nsuch a discussion and possible vote, having considered the proposal and engaged in discussions on this \nmatter on two previous occasions; and a query regarding possible consequences of a negative vote on the \nmatter at GFC. \nAt this point in the meeting, Mr Petros Kusmu, SU President, who was in attendance at this meeting as an \nobserver, was invited to the table to assist Mr Chelen in responding to members’ questions and concerns \nregarding the SU’s Fall Term Reading Week proposal and its inclusion on the upcoming GFC Agenda for \nformal action. \nA member proposed a Motion to amend the GFC Agenda of March 24, 2014 to include a vote on the Fall \nTerm Reading Week (Green and Gold Week) proposal. \nDuring the brief discussion specifically centred on this Motion, members provided a number of comments \nand questions, including, but not limited to:  support for a vote of endorsement at GFC; that it would be \nbeneficial to hear the pros and cons associated with a Fall Term Reading Week explained at GFC; that a \nlist of the pros and cons is, in fact, contained within the current proposal; and clarification on where this \nitem, if included, would be situated on the Agenda for GFC’s March 24 meeting. \nMotion:  Amrhein/Chelen  \nTHAT the GFC Executive Committee amend the GFC Agenda of March 24, 2014 to include for formal \nconsideration and vote the Students’ Union’s (SU’s) Fall Term Reading Week (Green and Gold Week) \nproposal. \nCARRIED \n6.

The Task Force members are: \nProfessor Randall Morck, Stephen A. Jarislowsky Distinguished Chair in Finance and University \nProfessor, Faculty of Business; Professor Linda C. Reif, CN Professor of International Trade, \nFaculty of Law; Ms. Susan Cake, PhD student, Department of Sociology; and Ms. Caitlin \nBullerkist, BA student, Department of Political Science. \nThe White Paper states that: \n“The GFC Task Force will objectively review GFC committees’ structure and activities, and the \nevolution of these, as compared to each committee’s terms of reference, and the PSLA [Post-\nSecondary Learning Act].  Specifically, the GFC Task Force will examine: \n1. Each GFC committee’s Terms of Reference to ensure that the terms of reference are up-\nto-date and reflect University policies and the PSLA, but also the current operations of \neach committee. \n2. Each committee’s activities to ensure that they are focused on governance issues relevant \nto that committee, and not activities that are the responsibility of other committees or \nadministrative offices. \n3. The alignment of the committees to identify duplication and/or gaps in committee \nactivities, as it relates to the governance pathways within GFC committees.” \nThe Task Force interprets the terms of the White Paper to indicate a focus on GFC committees.  \nHowever, the White Paper also instructs us to look at “the overall GFC structure”.   \nThe original process and completion timelines contained in the White Paper were revised due to \nthe pressing budgetary situation faced by the University of Alberta over the spring and summer \nof 2013.  As a result, the Task Force was set up in the 2013 Fall semester and started work on \nOctober 23, 2013.  A document review and interviews were undertaken during the period \nNovember 2013 to March 2014, as detailed below in Section 8: Resources.  The terms of \nreference of GFC/GFC committees are available on-line at: \n 2 \nhttp://governance.ualberta.ca/GeneralFacultiesCouncil.aspx.  \nSECTION 2: FRAMEWORK FOR THINKING ABOUT GOOD \nGOVERNANCE \nGovernance is the process through which an organization such as a business corporation, a \ngovernment ministry, or a university reaches decisions.  Good governance means getting to the \nright decisions with acceptably few errors via a process that imposes acceptably tolerable costs.  \nPoor governance occurs if unacceptably many wrong decisions occur or if getting to right \ndecisions is unacceptably costly.   \nThe future is largely unpredictable, so all organizations make decisions that turn out badly.  By a \nwrong decision, we mean a decision that, given information readily available at the time, would \nhave been made otherwise were the organization’s goals in clear focus. Decisions can be \nexcessively swayed by vocal or influential minorities.  Decisions can be too rash when they are \nmade with inadequate gathering or processing of information.  Insufficiently transparent \ndecisions, even if entirely correct, can fail on implementation for want of “buy-in”.  The costs of \nsuch problems are the costs of errors in the decision-making process.  \nBut exhaustive consultation, protracted contemplation, strained debate, and pointlessly detailed \ntransparency are also expensive.  Excessively lengthy decision-making can let valuable \nopportunities slip away. Meaningful engagement in governance requires an expenditure of time \nand effort to gather information, distinguish the relevant from the irrelevant, formulate and \nweigh alternatives, and attend meetings.  The time and effort so spent have an “opportunity \ncost”: the time and effort that otherwise would have been spent acquiring new ideas, improving \nteaching, and advancing research.  Indeed, the quality of decision-making can actually \ndeteriorate if the governance process consumes time and effort past a certain point because \npeople with high opportunity costs then withdraw from the governance process, taking with them \nwhatever insights, information, and judgment they might have contributed.  The costs of such \nproblems are costs of the decision-making process itself.  \nBecause neither error-free governance nor cost-free governance is feasible, good governance is \ninevitably a trade-off.  Good governance balances the cost of inevitable errors against the costs \nof operating the decision-making process itself.  This trade-off is quite likely different for \ndifferent sorts of issues, and it quite likely changes substantially with time.  In particular, the \nUniversity of Alberta is a much larger and more complicated organization now than it was even a \nfew decades ago, and we operate in an environment of more pressing constraints than in decades \npast.  Decision-making processes and systems of delegation that made sense in the University of \nAlberta several decades ago may merit revisiting.  In particular, as we discuss further below, \nattention might be given to formally reconsidering the terms of reference, defining the delegated \n 3 \nhttp://governance.ualberta.ca/GeneralFacultiesCouncil.aspx\npowers of GFC committees, and even the list of committees in operation. \nThe University of Alberta’s larger size and complexity make a case for increased reliance on \ndelegation.  This is because greater organizational size and complexity increase the costs to \nmembers of GFC of becoming informed.  These costs are imposed on a large number of \nmembers of a GFC necessarily grown bigger to include acceptable representation from a longer \nand more diverse set of constituencies.  These increases in the cost of decision-making by the \nfull body of GFC shift the balance of costs and benefits to favor more delegation in many \nimportant contexts.  Various sorts of delegation can be considered.   \nAdministrative delegation is the delegation of authority to administrative personnel to apply \nwell-defined procedures, and is the formal justification for delegating authority in many parts of \nthe University of Alberta.  The implementation of procedures is appropriately delegated to \nadministrators, but formulating the policies that determine which procedures are appropriate is \nless often subject to administrative delegation.  There are inevitable grey areas – decisions that \nare both policy and procedure – and the cost balance described above comes into play in setting \nrules about who decides which grey areas are delegated.  More transparent administrative \ndecision-making, more frequent review of procedures in effect by policy-makers, and more  \naccountable administrators make more extensive administrative delegation defensible.   \nPolicies can, however, be subject to executive delegation.  Executive delegation is the delegation \nof judgment calls to a decision-maker whose job is to become well informed so as to be able to \nmake calls consistent with the broader objectives of the organization.  CEOs and Prime Ministers \nexercise executive power.  The University of Alberta’s President and Provost, the Faculties’  \nDeans, and various other senior administrators are also executive decision-makers.  We devote \nconsiderable attention to selecting people to whom we delegate executive authority, and then \nhold them accountable for the overall outcomes over which they preside.  This reflects the cost \nbalance in that it uses the scarce time and effort of members of GFC as efficiently as possible.  \nWhile the University’s executive decision-makers must consult GFC or its committees where \nwarranted, we cannot expect them to do so for every judgment call.  Likewise, while we expect \nmembers of GFC to take steps to become more informed, we cannot expect them to read \nextensively on every issue pertinent to every judgment call.  GFC committees, whose members \nare charged with becoming informed about specific issues only, are another form of executive \ndelegation: the full membership of GFC trusts members of key committees to bear the costs of \nbecoming informed so they can make judgment calls that GFC likely would have made had all \nits members borne the costs of becoming informed about all the issues pertinent to a decision.   \nThe boundaries of executive delegation are even less readily definable than those of \nadministrative delegation.  The permeable boundaries of GFC committees’ delegated authority \nover certain policy decisions are evidence of this.  So are tensions over what policy decisions the \nUniversity’s executive decision-makers may and may not make without the consent of GFC, or \nwhich of its committees hold certain delegated policy decision-making powers.   \n 4 \nThe good governance of an evolving organization, such as a university committed to rapidly \nimproving its research standing while delivering excellent teaching and serving the province \nmore broadly, is necessarily a shifting balance of the costs of occasional suboptimal decisions \nbalanced against the cost of a more comprehensive decision-making process.  The grey area, in \nwhich this balance must be sought, is large and ill-defined, and the most critical grey areas now \nmay be starkly different from those thought most critical a generation ago.  Executive delegation \nand limits to executive delegation that made sense decades ago may be inefficient, inadequate, or \nsuperfluous given changes in the nature of the cost trade-off as events, opportunities, and \nconstraints change with time. \nSECTION 3:  FRAMEWORK FOR GOVERNANCE AT THE UNIVERSITY \nOF ALBERTA \nWhile the above principles are very general, the Task Force recognizes that their application to \nthe University of Alberta academic governance must respect existing institutions and values.  \nObviously, the University’s governance must be meaningfully collaborative, participatory, \ninclusive, and collegial. Faculty, students, administrators, administrative staff, and perhaps other \nconstituencies, such as alumni and post-doctoral fellows, must be meaningfully involved and \nhave effective voices in relevant decision-making.  The Task Force’s meetings with participants \nin GFC decision-making revealed no major dispute about this framework, and the Task Force \ntherefore sees no reason for fundamental changes to these overarching institutional values.  \nHowever, the Task Force has heard – repeatedly – that some of the potential issues raised by the \nOffice of the President of the University of Alberta in the White Paper are genuine concerns and \nmay well be genuine problems.  In particular, GFC governance may be positioned somewhat \naway from an optimal balance of costs and benefits as regards the following: \nDelegation – The Task Force has heard concerns that the delegation of authority to GFC \ncommittees and subcommittees is unclear and inconsistent with both actual practice and the \nUniversity’s needs.   \nTransparency and Simplicity – The Task Force has also heard concerns regarding lack of \ntransparency and simplicity. Collaborative, participatory, and inclusive governance requires high \nstandards of transparency.    \nThe Task Force has heard starkly conflicting evaluations of the current structure of GFC \ncommittees and subcommittees and of the speed and efficiency of the decision-making process.  \nWhile some persons and constituencies expressed satisfaction with the status quo, others deemed \nit unreasonably slow, complex, and costly in terms of time and reduplicated effort.  Where they \nare important, these features of university governance impede the meaningful engagement of our \never more time-pressed faculty and students, prevent the University of Alberta from engaging \n 5 \nwith external challenges and opportunities in a timely manner, and drive up costs.   \nThe general principles of good governance summarized above insist that all of these issues \nreflect a balancing of costs. An excessively simple decision-making process may be \nunacceptably error-prone.  An excessively transparent process may run afoul of privacy \nlegislation or impose undue costs.  An excessively rigid delegation system may leave committees \nincapable of coping effectively with new and unanticipated issues.  We believe that determining \nthese balancing points is best left to GFC itself, and therefore restrict ourselves to highlighting \nplaces where specific imbalances may have developed over the decades. \nSECTION 4:  ISSUES REGARDING DELEGATION \nA. Cases Where GFC Committee Functions May Have Diverged From \nExplicit  Delegated Authority  \ni. Academic Standards Committee (ASC) and its Subcommittee on Standards (ASC \nSOS) \nOur review has uncovered complaints about the number of committee approvals required in \nmoving up the academic governance committee chain.  We have heard that this results in \nconsiderable workload for the faculty or other body needing academic governance approval for \ntheir new initiative, delays in obtaining the final approval, and overall inefficiencies in the \ngovernance process.  The academic governance approval structure is also complicated in some \ncases, especially when new proposals are not run-of-the-mill subject matter, raising uncertainty \nas to which committee approvals are required.  This raises associated issues for the Governance \nOffice.     \nExcessive layers of required committee approvals are seen to be a particular problem in the area \nof new undergraduate and graduate program approvals.  Only the roles of GFC’s committees and \nsubcommittees can be addressed by this Task Force.  The full approval process begins at the \ndepartment level, then passes through a faculty approval process, then goes on to the Faculty of \nGraduate Studies and Research (FGSR) in the case of graduate programs.  The GFC is involved \nas proposals move through its Academic Standards Committee (ASC) Subcommittee on \nStandards (SOS), ASC itself, and GFC’s Academic Planning Committee (APC).  Thereafter, \nproposals require provincial government approval and, in some cases, approval by the Board of \nGovernors and their committees as well.  The Task Force has heard complaints that the overall \nprocess is puzzlingly Byzantine, and GFC may wish to consider rationalizing the steps under its \njurisdiction. \nOur review of ASC and ASC SOS suggests that some GFC committee functions have diverged \nfrom explicit delegated authority.  ASC terms of reference state that:  \n 6 \n“ASC is responsible for making recommendations and/or for providing advice to GFC, \nits Executive Committee, and/or the GFC Academic Planning Committee (APC) on the \nmatters...[listed in the terms of reference], which include such areas as admissions and \ntransfer, including admission and transfer to Faculties, admission of Open Studies \nstudents, academic standing policies and general university admission policies, and all \ninstitutional marking and grading policies and/or procedures” (section 3).   \nGFC has delegated some approval powers to ASC, including:  \n“the authority to approve proposals for the establishment of and termination of credit and \nnon-credit certificates, regardless of the proposing academic unit.  Where additional \nfunding and/or space is required to support the offering of the proposed certificate and/or \nif, in the opinion of the Provost and Vice-President (Academic) (or delegate), the \ncertificate requires Government approval, ASC would provide a recommendation on the \n(proposed) initiative to the GFC Academic Planning Committee (APC)” (section 3G).    \nSimilarly, the terms of reference of ASC SOS require it:  \n“[t]o review and make recommendations to the GFC Academic Standards Committee \n(ASC) with respect to a number of issues which affect all students at the University of \nAlberta.  These include, but are not limited to: a. examination policy, b. academic \ndefinitions, c. academic standing regulations, d. admission/transfer requirements” \n(section 3).   \nCurrently, it appears that the Chair of ASC uses his/her discretion to decide whether a new \nproposal goes directly to ASC or has to be reviewed by ASC SOS before moving to ASC and \nthen onwards up the approval chain.  \nA review of the actual decisions currently being made by ASC and ASC SOS reveals them to be \ndeeply engaged in the design and approval of new academic programs and degrees, as well as \nrevisions to current programs and degrees.  While ASC does have explicit authority over \nofferings by the Faculty of Extension and certificates offered by all faculties (section 3F-G), a \nreview of ASC’s terms of reference reveals that ASC’s explicit authority over degree programs is \nlimited to their standards for admissions and transfers.  Their courses, content, and other material \ncharacteristics are within the explicitly delegated authority of the APC, and are not obviously \nany concern of ASC or ASC SOS.   \nASC, and therefore by extension ASC SOS, can opt to involve itself in any issues it deems \nappropriate by dint of the final clause, 3H, “Other Matters”, in its delegated authority.  ASC and \nASC SOS decisions as regards these issues are therefore not illegitimate.  However, ASC is \nclearly acting well beyond the decision-making scope explicitly laid out its terms of reference.  \nGFC may wish to consider regularizing ASC’s operation by formalizing the scope of its \nauthority in these areas in a revised statement of delegated authority.  If these decision-making \n 7 \npowers are to be explicitly delegated to ASC, GFC may wish to consider revising the statement \nof delegated authority for the APC to remove those decision-making powers.     \nThe approval of new programs, and of modifications to existing programs, is one of the most \nimportant substantive tasks before GFC committees.  It may be that such decisions merit more \nreflection than other issues before GFC committees, and that repeated presentations of the same \nmaterial to ASC SOS, ASC, and APC do in fact generate better proposals.   However, there is \nalso scope for error: the presentations given to different bodies may differ as their proponents try \nto play to the perceived biases of each committee or subcommittee.  Changes mandated by one \nbody may conflict with those mandated by another.  Changes mandated by one body may \nintroduce problems that would have been caught by a body that previously approved the \nproposal.   \nSuch potential problems, along with the reduplicated time and effort imposed on the people \ncharged with gaining approval for new programs or changes to existing programs, suggest that \nGFC may wish to consider vesting a single committee with the requisite authority for program \nand major program change approvals, and ensuring that it contains all necessary expertise.  \nAlternatively, two committees could be created: one dealing with undergraduate programs and \nthe other with graduate programs.  This Task Force notes that the University of Calgary has one \nsuch committee for each of undergraduate and graduate programs, apparently because the two \nsets of decisions require different sorts of information and expertise.  If one or two new \ncommittees for program approvals are created, ASC’s terms of reference might then be amended \nto ensure that it does not address program approvals, whereafter ASC SOS might even be found \nredundant and abolished.  \nGFC may also wish to reconsider the merits of assigning certificate approval to one committee \n(ASC) and new programs approvals to another (APC).  The original logic of this split may be \ndated, and GFC may wish to reconsider differences, if any, in the sorts of expertise needed to \nscreen certificates, as opposed to programs.    \nB. Cases Where Lack of Delegated Authority and GFC Inaction Leave Issues \nto Administration/Administrators \nGFC’s own terms of reference, enshrined in provincial legislation, are extremely broad and GFC \nalso has broad powers of delegation.  As noted above, delegation to executive and administrative \ndecision-makers is essential in an organization as large and complex as the University of Alberta. \nIf GFC or its committees had to be intimately involved in every such decision, the University \nwould quite likely find itself paralyzed.  Nonetheless, provincial legislation empowers GFC to \nassert its influence over decision-making that affects “the academic affairs of the university” \nsubject to the jurisdiction of the Board (PSLA section 26(1)).  For example, operating under the \nsame provincial legislation, one of the University of Calgary’s GFC standing committees is a \nResearch and Scholarship Committee.  The world has changed over the decades, and universities \n 8 \nnow do things that were not even imagined when GFC’s current committee structure was put in \nplace.  Today, some areas of great importance to the academic affairs of the University of \nAlberta may be dealt with almost entirely by university administrators and, as a result, there may \nbe insufficient, or insufficiently explicit, GFC committee oversight.  As a result, GFC may wish \nto reconsider its delegation of authority to administrators in these areas from time to time.   \nWe highlight three such areas where GFC needs to consider the explicit delegation of authority \nto GFC committees: \ni. Information Technology (IT) \nComputers, databases, websites, information technology (IT) support, and other aspects of IT are \nnow major parts of the lives of faculty, administrators, and students.  No current GFC committee \nhas explicit delegated authority to provide academic input into University of Alberta’s decisions \nregarding IT, and committees with open-ended “Other Matters” authority have chosen not to \nprovide such input.   \nIt may be that many IT decisions are best left entirely delegated to executive and administrative \ndecision-makers, but GFC may feel that such a sweeping delegation decision might better be \nmade explicitly than by default.   \nIf GFC chooses to become involved in IT decisions, a new GFC IT Committee, with explicitly \ndelegated authority, might be considered.  Alternatively, the retasking of an existing committee, \nincluding an appropriate reassessment of its composition, might be considered.  Extensive \nconsultation with the Office of the Vice-Provost & Associate Vice-President (Information \nTechnology), and with students, administration, and faculty users of IT should go into such a \ndecision.   \nii. Libraries \nLibraries have changed almost beyond recognition from what they were a generation ago.  Hard \ncopy journals are largely in storage, and most students and faculty now interact with the library \nsystem via electronic databases.  This radical restructuring is ongoing, and is largely happening \nwithout serious input from GFC or GFC committees.   \nShould GFC choose to become involved in this IT-related metamorphosis of university libraries, \nand should it establish a new GFC IT Committee, that committee’s explicitly delegated authority \nmight extend to the library system.  GFC might then wish to consider appropriate representation \nfrom senior librarians on such a committee.  Alternatively, GFC may wish to establish a new \nLibrary Committee or retask an existing committee.  Regardless, such a decision might best be \ntaken after extensive consultation with librarians and library users – both students and faculty.   \n 9 \niii. Research \nThe University of Alberta has always valued research.  However, over the decades, world class \nresearch has become an ever more important part of the University’s contribution to society. \nAPC’s terms of reference give it explicit jurisdiction over “any research-related issue” (section \n3).  Apart from APC, research is seldom, if ever, mentioned in the terms of reference of GFC \ncommittees. Research matters are seldom addressed in GFC committees, including APC.  When \nresearch issues have been brought to the GFC committee framework for approvals, \nadministrators have encountered difficulties in determining which GFC committee approvals \nhave to be obtained. \nAs with IT and libraries, it may well be good governance to delegate most or all decision-making \nauthority regarding research-related issues to well-chosen executive and administrative decision-\nmakers.  However, GFC may wish to consider making such a delegation decision explicitly, \nrather than by inaction.  Should GFC wish to delegate authority over research-related issues to a \nresearch-focused committee, a new committee with new terms of reference might be created.  \nAlternatively, an existing committee’s terms of reference might be amended to provide it with \nsuch authority. Obviously, such decisions would invite extensive consultation with research \nfaculty, graduate, and post-doctoral student representatives, and the Office of the Vice-President \n(Research).  Yet another alternative is for GFC to decide, upon weighing the costs and benefits, \nexplicitly to eschew this area of decision-making, thereby de facto delegating it to carefully \nchosen and highly competent administrators.   \nThere are no doubt other areas that, by default, have ended up entirely delegated to \nadministrative and executive decision-makers.  Again, we emphasize that such delegation may \nwell be best policy in many areas but, for those areas within the jurisdiction of GFC, it is \nultimately up to GFC to decide on these issues of delegation. \nC. Cases Where GFC Committees Interpret Their Terms of Reference Very \nConservatively \nOur review has found that at least one committee may be interpreting its terms of reference very \nconservatively: the Facilities Development Committee (FDC).  \ni. Facilities Development Committee (FDC)  \nThe PSLA gives GFC responsibility, subject to the authority of the Board of Governors, over \n“the academic affairs of the University” (section 26(1)), and provides that GFC may make \nrecommendations to the Board of Governors on inter alia “academic planning”, “campus \nplanning”, and “a building program” (section 26(1)(o)). Section 19 requires that the Board of \nGovernors:  \n 10 \n“consider the recommendations of the general faculties council, if any, on matters of \nacademic import prior to providing for (a) the support and maintenance of the university, \n(b) the betterment of existing buildings, [and] (c) the construction of any new buildings \nthe board considers necessary for the purposes of the university.”   \nGFC delegates essentially all of these duties to the FDC in that committee’s terms of reference.  \nThis Task Force has heard concerns that FDC may be interpreting its terms of reference to limit \ndiscussions regarding the impact, design, construction, and use of facilities on campus.  The \nlimited interpretation may come from deliberate delegation of decision-making in these areas to \nother committees or to administrators.  If so, the appropriate forums for such input might be \nclarified. GFC may also wish to consider the costs and benefits of delegating such decision-\nmaking to administrators.  Concerns regarding these areas of decision-making relate to \novercrowding in some departments and largely vacant buildings or floors in others, and to \nproblems associated with student residences.  Thus, GFC may wish to consider whether or not \noffice space for graduate students, inhabitable student residences, etc. fall within its authority \nover the academic affairs of the university.  \nAs noted above, we recommend that GFC and its committees appropriately delegate decision-\nmaking to qualified professionals to avoid unduly complicating and slowing the decision-making \nprocess.  However, FDC’s terms of reference empower it to advise the Board of Governors \nwhenever issues relating to the University’s physical facilities and their use arise.  The Task \nForce is of the opinion that GFC could instruct FDC to interpret their terms of reference to \ninclude discussions concerning such issues.    \nD. Cases Where GFC Committee Functions Have Become Disconnected \nFrom the University of Alberta’s Needs  \nAnother way in which GFC and its committee structure may have become dated is in the \npersistence of committees whose functions, while once important and difficult, are now either \nreadily and efficiently delegated or potentially no longer worthwhile given their costs.  We cite \ntwo examples: \ni. Undergraduate Awards and Scholarships Committee (UASC) \nPursuant to its terms of reference, the Undergraduate Awards and Scholarships Committee \n(UASC) has delegated authority from GFC to, inter alia:  \n“1. approve new undergraduate awards; 2. approve changes to any undergraduate student \naward already approved by GFC UASC; 3. approve the minimum value of a major award \nfor undergraduate students, and to review that value regularly; [and] 4. approve the \n 11 \nminimum value of an undergraduate award administered by the Student Awards Office, \nand to review that value regularly” (section 3).  \nUASC also makes recommendations to the GFC Executive Committee (GFC Exec) “on any new \npolicy or revisions to existing policy governing awards for undergraduate students” (section \n3(6)).  The GFC Exec retains the authority in its terms of reference “for making rules and \nregulations respecting [undergraduate] academic awards” (section 3(3)). \nThe Task Force has been told that the work of UASC is essentially administrative in nature.  It \nhas been described as having an underwhelming agenda.  Most of the Committee’s tasks involve \nreviewing the terms of awards after an administrator and/or Faculty staff have already reviewed \nthem, and then approving the awards or changes thereto.  Our review also found that UASC \nseldom addresses policy matters.  \nIf GFC ascertains that UASC’s administrative work can be readily and efficiently delegated, and \ncommittee members doing editorial work is not cost effective, GFC governance process could \nbenefit from reallocating scarce committee member talent and time to other GFC committees \nwhere concentrated high-level expertise is needed.  GFC may wish to consider terminating \nUASC.  UASC’s award editing and approval functions might be delegated to administrators who \nhave the appropriate training, with the approved terms included in consent agendas for approval \nby GFC Exec.  GFC may wish to consider giving GFC Exec the authority to carry out the other \nmandates of UASC, in particular the approval of minimum values of undergraduate awards and \npolicy-making on undergraduate awards pursuant to section 3(3) of its terms of reference.      \nii. Committee on the Learning Environment (CLE) \nThe Committee on the Learning Environment (CLE) has a mandate “that promotes an optimal \nlearning environment in alignment with guiding documents of the University of Alberta” (section \n3).  GFC has delegated to the CLE the authority “[t]o recommend to the GFC Academic \nPlanning Committee and to the GFC Executive Committee broad policy directions for excellence \nin teaching and learning” (section 3).  The CLE can make recommendations “concerning policy \nmatters and action matters” with respect to topics such as the implementation of the University \nAcademic Plan with respect to teaching and learning; development and implementation of \npolicies on teaching, learning, teaching evaluation, and recognition for teaching that promote the \nAcademic Plan; development of policies on promotion of ongoing teaching assessment; \nnurturing the development of innovative and creative teaching practices; encouraging sharing \nand discussion of evidence on effective teaching and learning; promotion of critical reflection on \nthe impact of broad societal changes in teaching and learning; and promotion of projects that \noffer unique teaching and learning opportunities that would benefit the university community \n(section 3). \n 12 \nOur review has shown that the CLE undertakes careful and insightful studies with most of this \nwork accomplished through numerous subcommittees.  However, that any of these studies \ncorrespond with matters on which GFC takes action is unclear.  \nGFC may wish to consider rethinking the role of the CLE.  CLE may well be a necessary \ncommittee whose mandate merely needs revision to better reflect the current and changing \nuniversity concerns relevant to our teaching and learning environment.  Topics suggested for \ninclusion or enhancement in the CLE’s mandate include IT as it relates to teaching and learning, \nthe libraries system, and museums and collections.  However, this risks an overly broad mandate \nthat might overlap with a perhaps necessary new IT committee, and such overlapping \njurisdictions have been found to slow the academic governance process unduly.  Alternatively, \nGFC may wish to consider tasking the CLE with priority issues needing timely action.  Yet \nanother possibility is that temporary ad hoc committees to explore topical issues as the need \narises might replace the CLE.  Such ad hoc committees might be established by GFC or ad hoc \nsubcommittees established by either GFC Exec or the APC. \nSECTION 5: TRANSPARENCY AND SIMPLICITY  \nGFC may wish to consider ways in which governance can be rendered more transparent and \nsimpler, and kept better in step with the University of Alberta’s ever changing needs.  \nCollaborative, participatory, and inclusive governance requires high standards of transparency.  \nWhen there is a lack of transparency people cannot easily comprehend the importance or \nimplications of pending decisions, let alone how they might relate to past decisions that shaped \ncurrent policies and procedures.  Furthermore, people are unlikely to know how to collaborate \nand when to participate, and are thus unlikely to participate when the broader university \ncommunity would benefit from their input.  This is especially true for student representatives and \nnew faculty representatives, both of whom often need to become meaningfully informed within \nvery short time windows. \nThe Task Force makes the following suggestions for increasing transparency and simplicity of \nacademic governance: \nA. Online Digital Archive   \nGFC may wish to reconsider the balance of costs and benefits regarding transparency.  In the \npast, physical constraints limited the scope for transparency.  Large archives of files and bound \nvolumes of agendas and minutes are difficult to organize, index, and use.  Consequently, \npermanent records of much that GFC did, especially through its committees and subcommittees, \nare cumbersome and cursory at best.  Bound volumes in a room in an administration building \nmay well have been entirely appropriate decades ago, without modern IT and in what was then a \n 13 \nsmaller institution, in which personal connections and memories could fill in gaps in institutional \nmemory.   \nThe University of Alberta may have become too large, diverse, and dynamic to do without an \nupgrade to its institutional memory.  This is because a lack of understanding of the reasons \nexisting policies and procedures were adopted creates a conservative bias.  We avoid changing \ncurrent practices because we rightly suspect that there is a good reason for those practices.  But \nwhen pressed, we may well have no idea what that reason might be.  We therefore err on the side \nof leaving well enough alone: that is, accept a conservative bias.  \nElectronic archives take up little space and can be searched readily, obviating the need for costly \nhard copy indexes and cross-indexes.  This is an example of how new technology alters the cost-\nbenefit tradeoffs that frame good governance.  Given these new technological options, GFC may \nwish to consider establishing and maintaining an online digital archive of the work undertaken \nby GFC and all its committees and subcommittees that is far more extensive and complete than \nthe information currently provided on the University of Alberta website.  Such an archive should \nbe comprehensively electronically searchable and indexed, so future generations of students, \nfaculty, and other members of the university community can quickly and easily inform \nthemselves about the reasons why we do things the ways we do.  Obviously, the contents and \naccessibility of such a database would be constrained by legitimate restrictions such as privacy \nlaw. \nGFC may wish to consider augmenting material currently available online with draft minutes, \nand official meeting files in this online archive.  The Task Force has heard that, in some cases, \nminutes are posted so long after a meeting their exact context is forgotten.  Such problems not \nonly limit the usefulness of minutes, but also limit people’s ability to spot errors and request \ncorrections.  Posting clearly marked draft minutes and meeting files could aid people who missed \nmeetings to stay up to date in a timely fashion and help ensure accuracy of information.  \nInformation currently provided online is on the governance page of the University of Alberta’s \nweb site at http://governance.ualberta.ca/GeneralFacultiesCouncil.aspx.  This information is not \nprominent when the University of Alberta web site is accessed, and only emerges after \nnavigating through four layers of nested web pages (University of Alberta - Faculty and Staff - \nAdministration and Governance - University Governance).  This information might be directly \nlinked to the University home page.  For example, the University of Calgary has an “Admin. and \nGovernance” link on its home page: http://www.ucalgary.ca/.      \n B. Tracking Changes in Proposals \nThe Task Force has heard that minutes of GFC committees are limited in the information \nconveyed and that statements of issues often provide insufficiently in-depth information about \nthe development of and changes in a proposal as it progresses through various GFC committees, \nand that this can lead to confusion and duplication of efforts.  When a proposal must be \n 14 \nhttp://governance.ualberta.ca/GeneralFacultiesCouncil.aspx\nhttp://www.ucalgary.ca/\nconsidered by more than one committee, one committee can be entirely unaware of what has \nbeen discussed and previously changed by another committee.  This means that a proposal might \nbe amended to meet the requirements of Committee A only to be changed again by Committee \nB, negating the work done by Committee A.  The Task Force has also heard that proposals can \nbe presented differently, to play to the perceived prejudices of members of different committees, \nand that this often goes undetected.   \nGFC can perhaps most readily limit such problems by improving its governance so that as many \nissues as possible go before only one committee, endowed with all relevant expertise.  If GFC \ndetermines that approval paths through multiple committees and subcommittees are necessary, \nthe online digital archive discussed above might at least mitigate these costs.  Such an archive \nmight also include the text of and accompanying materials for each variation of a proposal as it \nmoves up the chain of GFC committees until it obtains final approval.  This would enhance \ntransparency and accountability in proposal development, creating greater faith in complicated \nmulti-committee GFC processes.  \n C. Enhanced Information Resources for New Proposals \nThe Task Force has also heard complaints about the quality of information provided to \nindividuals or groups interested in engaging with GFC and its committees.  For example, some \nfaculty and administrators responsible for formulating new program proposals worry that they \nare given inconsistent or muddled advice.  Indeed, the Task Force has heard that such \ninformation is neither readily available nor readily comprehensible.  The Provost’s Office or \nGovernance Office often step forward to provide one-on-one assistance in such cases.  However, \nwhen key personnel retire or move on, the resulting institutional knowledge deficit can be costly \nto people needing to engage with GFC or its committees, especially new administrators or \nfaculty and students.     \nGFC may wish to consider the provision of enhanced information resources on drafting new \nprogram proposals based on up-to-date templates.  The information and drafting advice could \nthen be clear, consistent, accurate, and up-to-date, and could reside in one location online so as to \nbe readily accessible to students, faculty, and staff.  GFC may also wish to work with the \nadministration to ensure the retention of institutional knowledge regarding new program \nproposal drafting to assist people who are either new to the system or formulating unusually \ncomplex proposals. \nSECTION 6: GOVERNANCE OVERSIGHT AND ACCOUNTABILITY \nGFC may wish to review the organization and oversight of the Governance Office and of \nadministrative policies and procedures.  Both have undergone a series of changes in recent years.  \nThe Task Force has heard of difficulties navigating the GFC committee chain to obtain final \n 15 \napproval for new proposals.  Faculty, administrators, and students are often uncertain about \nwhich GFC committee to access first and where a proposal must move subsequently.  GFC may \nwish to exercise its power to streamline and clarify these issues.   \nThe Governance Office must also advise people seeking to engage with the Board of Governors \nand its committees.  This dual duty is a recent imposition, and was advocated to replenish \nadministrative support for the Board of Governors.  The Task Force has heard that the allocation \nof responsibilities between GFC and its committees, on the one hand, and the Board of \nGovernors and university administrative offices, on the other, can be confusing and opaque.       \n A. Establish GFC Standing Committee on Governance \nGFC may wish to consider establishing a standing Committee on Governance, authorized to \nperiodically revisit the terms of reference for each GFC committee and to recommend changes to \nmaintain committee relevancy as the university environment changes.  Such a committee might \nalso consider, from time to time, proposals to alter the terms of reference of GFC committees in \nan effort to help them get to the correct decision as frequently as possible while imposing as low \na cost as possible on all parties involved.  The Committee on Governance could also periodically \nreview the overall structure of GFC committees to determine whether new committees are \nneeded and/or existing committees are still relevant.  In all such decisions, the Committee on \nGovernance might be tasked with comparing the costs and benefits of the existing system with \nthose of proposed alternatives.  Further, in reviewing the GFC committee approval path for new \nprogram proposals and the timeliness of the process, the Committee on Governance might \nundertake more extensive consultations on a confidential basis with persons who have \nshepherded proposals through to final approval. \nAs discussed further below under “Governance Office Accountability and Accessibility”, a \nCommittee on Governance could also provide a valuable service by overseeing the University of \nAlberta Governance Office personnel who provide services for GFC.  At present, the \nGovernance Office lacks a clear job description and terms of reference, largely as a result of a \nrecent reform that merged support for the Board of Governors and GFC into one office without \nclearly designating that office’s position in the chain of command.  \nThis means that the Governance Office is left to interpret their role as they choose.  In practice, \nas noted above, this may often have resulted in a conservative bias.  Fearful of providing \n“wrong” advice, the Governance Office quite understandably may begin to err on the side of \nunduly cautious advice, recommending excessively cumbersome and lengthy pathways.  This \nentirely rational response to ambiguous responsibility obviously imposes costs on the rest of the \nUniversity.  A GFC Committee on Governance could remedy this problem by providing clear \ninstructions to the Governance Office as regards engaging with GFC and its committees and \nsubcommittees.   \n 16 \nB. Governance Office Accountability and Accessibility \nAs noted above, the Governance Office lacks a clear chain of command and has been moved \nfrom place to place in the university's administrative chain of accountability in recent years.  \nGFC may wish to consider how to stabilize the position of the Governance Office so as to give it \na clear accountability to GFC.  Recent reforms have shifted its accountability variously to the \nPresident, the Provost, and the University Secretary. Obviously, the Governance Office, as \ncurrently constituted, needs sufficient autonomy to serve both the Board of Governors and GFC \nand its committees.  GFC may wish to consider splitting the Governance Office into two separate \nunits or bodies so that it is easier to create an accountability relationship between GFC, or its \nCommittee on Governance, and those Governance Office staff who provide services for GFC \nand its committees.  The unification of support for the Board of Governors and GFC into the \ncurrent Governance Office saved roughly one administrative position, and providing the \nGovernance Office with clear instructions, duties, and accountability may be worth the money.  \nGFC may wish to consider making the Governance Office more accessible to faculty and \nstudents needing information about the GFC committee structure and how to navigate it.    \nAccessibility might be improved through various practices.  For example, brief periods might be \nset aside before GFC and/or GFC committee meetings for people to ask Governance staff \nquestions relevant to the meeting and committee process.  Other examples are discussed in more \ndetail in the sections below on “Online Delegation Resource”, “Governance 101”, and \n“Statements of Issues”. \nC. Online Delegation Resource \nThe Task Force has heard that it is difficult to determine the extent of GFC’s delegation of \nauthority to various GFC committees, making it difficult to understand the overall governance \nstructure, the routing for approval of proposals, and the extent of the authority of each \ncommittee.  \nGFC may wish to consider creating an online delegation resource.  This resource might outline \nthe sources, dates, and chains of the delegations of authority for issue areas that GFC deems \nappropriate.  The delegation resource might also include descriptions of the authority delegated \nto senior administrative officers such as the President, Provost, or other senior administrative \nofficers.  Further, such a delegation resource might more clearly highlight linkages between \nUAPPOL policies and procedures that speak to areas within the terms of reference of GFC and \nits committees. \n 17 \nD. Governance 101 \nGovernance 101 is currently the main orientation offered to those new to University governance. \nThe orientation places equal emphasis on the Board of Governors, Deans Council, and the GFC \nand its committee structure. The orientation is more an introductory overview of governance \nrather than how to navigate the committee pathways and how to engage with GFC and its \ncommittees.  GFC may wish to revise Governance 101 to increase its benefits for new student \nand faculty representatives.  Consideration might also be given to increasing the frequency of \nGovernance 101 presentations tailored to new faculty and students serving as GFC or GFC \ncommittee members.  \nE. Statements of Issues \nStatements of issues are currently written by those who are presenting proposals before \ncommittees.  This could lead to proposals having an inherent bias and a failure to provide an \nobjective and complete overview.  A more comprehensive and readily electronically searchable \nonline record of the debate surrounding current and past proposals might let GFC and committee \nmembers better appreciate alternative perspectives and provide constructive criticism by better \ninterpreting current proposals in light of past records.   \nF. Committee Scheduling and Agenda Deadlines \nCurrently the deadline for getting proposals on the meeting agendas of GFC or its committees is \ntwo weeks in advance of the meeting.  This can create difficulties for people needing to move a \nproposal through multiple tightly scheduled committee meetings.  Where multiple committee \napprovals are deemed cost-effective and therefore good governance, GFC may wish to consider \nshortening the two week advance notice for meeting agenda items and scheduling committee \nmeetings to increase the speed of proposals through the GFC committee governance pathway. \nHowever, as mentioned above, GFC might preclude most such situations from arising in the first \nplace by reorganizing its committees so, wherever possible, a single committee contains all \nnecessary expertise to approve or deny a proposal. \nSECTION 7: SUGGESTED NEXT STEP \nThe Task Force consists of two faculty members, a graduate student, and an undergraduate \nstudent.  Obviously it is not fully representative of the constituent groups that comprise GFC.  \nAccordingly, the Task Force has structured its report to provide broad suggestions to the \nPresident in her capacity as Chair of GFC on reforming GFC committees and the overall GFC \nstructure.  The Task Force suggests that further review and the final decisions on GFC committee \n 18 \nreform and overall GFC structural reform be undertaken by a body with a membership broadly \nrepresentative of all GFC constituent groups.  This body might be established by GFC in the \nform of an ad hoc committee or task force. \nSECTION 8: RESOURCES \nInterviews: \nColleen Skidmore, Chair, Facilities Development Committee, January 29, 2014 \nMarion Haggarty-France, University Secretary, February 4, 2014 \nGarry Bodnar, Secretary to GFC and Director of GFC Services, February 4, 2014 \nAndrea Patrick, Assistant Secretary to GFC, February 4, 2014 \nKatalin Bimbo, Chair, Undergraduate Awards and Scholarships Committee, February 6, 2014 \nBill Connor, Chair, Academic Standards Committee/ASC Sub-Committee on Standards, \nFebruary 12, 2014 \nBill Connor, Chair, Committee on the Learning Environment, February 12, 2014 \nDustin Chelen, Students’ Union Vice-President Academic, February 12, 2014  \nAdam Woods, Students’ Union Vice-President External, February 12, 2014 \nVon Whiting, Senior Administrative Officer, Office of the Provost, February 18, 2014 \nSandra Kereliuk, Senior Administrative Officer, Vice President (Finance and Administration), \nFebruary 18, 2014 \nMary Paul, Senior Administrative Officer, Vice President (Facilities and Operations), February \n18, 2014 \nKatharine Moore, Senior Administrative Officer, Vice President (Research), February 18, 2014 \nCharleen Schmidt, Senior Administrative Officer, Vice President (Advancement), February 18, \n2014 \nAndrea Smith, Senior Administrative Officer, Vice President (University Relations), February \n18, 2014 \nGwen Bauer, Manager, Policy Standards Office, February 18, 2014 \nElizabeth Le, Chair, University Teaching Awards Committee, February 26, 2014 \n 19 \nCarl G.

This \nattached document incorporates the suggestions made by members on this issue at meetings \nheld throughout the Fall of 2014 and Winter 2015 (including GFC’s meeting of November 24, \n2014). \nThe GFC Executive Committee has chosen to prepare ‘Guidelines’ at this time in order to “test \ndrive” the processes associated with bringing  items to GFC meetings for collegial discussion.  \nIf, after working with these guidelines and experiencing these discussions at Council meetings, \nmembers feel they should be altered and/or enshrined in policy, that will be addressed \naccordingly in due course.   \nThe first call for discussion items will go out to GFC in the late Spring—the intention is to \nadjudicate suggestions received with a view to bringing the first item for discussion to the \nSeptember 28, 2015 meeting of GFC. \nPlease recognize this is a ‘living document’ which, over time, may change to reflect the \nexperience of developing items for and engaging in these discussions at meetings of GFC. \nThanks for your attention. \nAttachment (1) \nR:\\GO05 General Faculties Council - Committees\\EXE\\14-15\\FE-23\\Items\\Working\\Item-Guidelines-for-GFC-Discussion-\nPeriod-Covering-Memo-Att-1.dotx \nDate: Friday, February 13, 2015 \nTo: Members of General Faculties Council \nFrom: GFC Executive Committee \nRe: GFC Discussion Period ‘Guidelines’ \n Attachment 2 \nGuidelines for GFC Discussion Sessions \nPurpose of the Discussion Session \nThe proposed discussion session is intended to facilitate the debate of, and sharing of viewpoints on, substantive \nissues facing GFC and the University as a whole.  The hope is to foster open, constructive, and timely discussions \non matters of significance to GFC and the wider university community. \nOther than being held to a typical length of 30 minutes, and being subject to normal GFC meeting procedures, the \nformat of sessions will not be constrained.  Depending on the item being discussed, the session could take the form \nof two presentations with opposing viewpoints followed by discussion, a single presentation followed by discussion, a \npanel discussion, or some entirely different format.  The format to be used will be decided by the GFC Executive \nCommittee on advice from the subgroup responsible for curating topic suggestions, with input from the proposer of \nthe topic. (See “Selection and Development of Topics.”) \nSolicitation of Topics \nThe GFC Executive Committee, acting under its authority to recommend GFC agendas, will welcome proposals for \ndiscussion topics throughout the year.  It will also explicitly advertise for them at the start of the fall and winter \nsemesters.  Since GFC is the body representing (and representative of) the entire campus community, this will \nensure that all constituent groups are given an opportunity to submit proposals relevant to them.  Proposals from all \ngroups will be given equal priority and will be judged based solely on merit (see “Selection and Development of \nTopics”). \nSubmissions are to be short, restricted to at most two pages.  They should clearly outline the following: \n• the specific question or issue being discussed \n• why it is relevant to GFC or the institution, and why GFC is an appropriate body to host the discussion \n• the intended form of discussion (eg. dueling presentations, expert panel, etc.) \n• what background information might need to be collected, or which people might need to be present \n• what is hoped to be gained from the discussion (eg. follow-up by an administrative body or GFC standing \ncommittee, increased awareness of issue, etc.) \nSelection and Development of Topics \nA subgroup of the GFC Executive Committee will be formed to curate and develop suggested discussion topics.  The \nsubgroup will be comprised of at least one faculty member, one undergraduate student, and one graduate student \nfrom the existing GFC Executive.  A non-academic staff representative will be invited to join this subgroup. \nSuggestions will be evaluated on their \n• current relevance to GFC and the University community \n• feasibility of having a substantive discussion within the 30-minute timeframe \n• clarity and completeness of proposal \nThe subgroup will support the proposer(s) of any selected topics, along with others as appropriate, to ensure that in \npreparation for discussion at GFC  \n• the question or issue is presented clearly \n• the proposed discussion format is appropriate \n• the appropriate information is gathered or people are available \n• any other concerns with the proposal are addressed \nThe final decision on which topics will appear on proposed GFC agendas rests, as delegated, with the GFC \nExecutive Committee.  The Executive Committee will be responsible for communicating a list of all proposed topics, \nalong with any other information it deems relevant, to the full GFC. \n Page 2 \nScheduling \nEvery effort will be made to regularly include discussion items on GFC agendas. However, time constraints and the \nvolume of regular business will sometime preclude their inclusion.  \nDiscussion Conduct \nThe Chair of GFC will be responsible for ensuring that the discussion session proceeds in a collegial manner \nconsistent with the format mandated by the GFC Executive Committee.  Normal GFC rules and procedures will \napply. \n2 \nAttachment 3 \nE-Mail to the Provost, Dr Carl Amrhein, dated August 28, 2014.  This was shared with the GFC \nExecutive Committee, at the request of the Provost and Chair of the GFC Executive Committee \nand the Office of the President, at the Committee’s September 8, 2014 meeting. \nDear Carl, \nIn an effort to revitalize discussion at GFC, the President would like to propose the inclusion of a topic for \ndebate during the discussion period of GFC meetings. The topic would be within GFC's mandate, around \na substantive issue that affects the University and/or academic institutions more generally. Topics would \nbe constructive and lead to a robust and inclusive debate, rather than one-sided criticisms against \nparticular GFC and/or university stakeholders. The President suggests that the topics would have a \nchampion - from either administration or faculty - to present the item to GFC and to set the parameters for \ndiscussion, possibly with a short written submission to accompany the GFC agenda so that members \nwould have time to thoughtfully consider the topic prior to the discussion. The President envisions that the \ndiscussion/debate would last for around 30 minutes, and would not result in any motions (as is consistent \nwith the GFC procedures around the Discussion section of the GFC agenda), but could result in items for \nadministration to consider and bring back for further discussion at GFC. \nThe President would like to challenge GFC Executive to consider and establish the rules for the debate, \nwith the expectation that the rules would serve to facilitate discussion, not constrain it; and as mentioned \nabove, it would be made explicit that there would be no motions arising from the discussion. \nThe President also suggested a number of topics, listed below, as examples of the sorts of issues that \nmight be considered by GFC Executive for discussion at GFC. She would also encourage GFC Executive \nto call upon GFC members to provide suggestions for topics.  \nExamples include: \n- Digital Learning Program \n- Should the University of Alberta establish a teaching stream? \n- Dare to Discover  \n- University targets - the Alberta Government and the Board of Governors are asking PSEs to set high-\nlevel targets, by which they can be measured. UofA Administration has held off on establishing targets. \nWhat kinds of targets are reasonable? \nPlease let me know if you have any questions or concerns about this proposal. \nAll the best, \nCatherine \nCatherine Swindlehurst, PhD, MBA \nDirector, Office of the President \n2-24 South Academic Building (SAB), University of Alberta, Edmonton, Alberta  CANADA  T6G 2G7 \nPH: (780) 492-9592 CELL: (780) 918-3116  FAX: (780) 492-9265  www.president.ualberta.ca \n1 \nhttp://www.president.ualberta.ca/\nGeneral Faculties Council \nExecutive Committee \nApproved Open Session Minutes \nMonday, September 08, 2014 \nRoom 2-31, South Academic Building (SAB) \n2:00 PM - 4:00 PM \nATTENDEES: \nVoting Members: \nCarl Amrhein Chair (Delegate), President  \nLisa Collins Member, Vice-Provost and University Registrar  \nDuncan Elliott Member, Academic Staff, Member of GFC  \nKaori Kabata Member, Academic Staff, Member of GFC  \nNavneet Khinda Member (Delegate), Vice-President (Academic), Students' Union \nColin More Member, Graduate Students' Association Vice-President (Academic)  \nNorma Nocente Member, Academic Staff, Member of GFC  \nSteve Patten Member, Academic Staff, Member of GFC  \nFahim Rahman Member, Undergraduate Student Representative, Member of GFC  \nSean Robertson Member, Academic Staff, Member of GFC  \nWendy Rodgers Member, Academic Staff, Member of GFC  \nJonathan White Member, Academic Staff, Member of GFC  \nOlive Yonge Member (Delegate), Provost and Vice-President (Academic)  \nPresenter(s): \nCarl Amrhein Provost and Vice-President (Academic) and Chair, GFC Executive \nCommittee \nGarry Bodnar Director of General Faculties Council Services and Secretary to GFC \nChris Fukushima Residence Area Coordinator, East Campus, Residence Services \nLise Gotell Vice-Dean, Faculty of Arts \nIngrid Johnston Associate Vice-President (Research) \nKatharine Moore Senior Administrative Officer, Office of the Vice-President (Research)  \nBrock Richardson Acting Assistant Dean of Students – Residence Life, Residence Services \nIndira Samarasekera President and Chair, General Faculties Council \nCatherine Swindlehurst Director, Office of the President  \nStaff: \nGarry Bodnar, Coordinator, GFC Executive Committee  \nAndrea Patrick, Scribe \nOPENING SESSION \n1.

The issues addressed in these sections are now covered by current University of \nAlberta Policies and Procedures On-Line (UAPPOL) policies and institutional documents. \nDiscussion: \nDr Johnston provided members with a brief synopsis of the proposal, adding that current policies set out in \nUAPPOL and other institutional documents now adequately address these issues and that Subsection 8, \nspecifically, was just a place holder that is no longer needed or relevant. \nMembers provided a number of comments and questions in relation to this proposal, including, but not \nlimited to:  clarification regarding the difference between ‘editorial’ and ‘urgent’ changes; clarification \nsurrounding the decision-making process around institutional policies and the manner in which these are \nconsidered outdated; clarification surrounding the difference between ‘deletion’ and ‘rescission’ of existing \npolicies/procedures; and a comment that the sections within this proposal seem to be at odds with the \ncurrent funding model. \nMotion: Rodgers/Collins \nGFC Executive Committee 09/08/2014 \nPage 3 \nTHAT the GFC Executive Committee approve, under delegated authority from General Faculties Council, \nthe rescission of Section 120.7 and deletion of Section 120.8 (University Community \nRelations)/Subsections 7 and 8) of the GFC Policy Manual, as submitted by the Office of the Vice-\nPresident (Research) and as set forth in Attachment 1, to take effect upon final approval. \nCARRIED \n5.

The issues \naddressed in these sections are now covered by current University of Alberta Policies and Procedures On-\nLine (UAPPOL) policies and institutional documents. \nDiscussion: \nDr Johnston reported to members that the proposed deletion of GFC Policy Manual Section 96.1, \nSubsections 5, 6 and 7, is appropriate and necessary as the issues are now addressed within current \npolicies set out in UAPPOL and other institutional documents.  She added that the proposal was drafted in \nconsultation with the Faculty of Graduate Studies and Research (FGSR). \nMotion: Patten/Kabata \nTHAT the GFC Executive Committee approve, under delegated authority from General Faculties Council, \nthe deletion of Section 96.1 (Research Policies/General Statement)/Subsections 5, 6 and 7 of the GFC \nPolicy Manual, as submitted by the Office of the Vice-President (Research) and as set forth in \nAttachment 1, to take effect upon final approval. \nCARRIED \n6. Deletion of GFC Policy Manual Section 116 (Trust Funds) – Proposal from the Offices of the Vice-\nPresident (Research), Vice-President (Advancement) and Vice-President (Finance and \nAdministration)  \nMaterials before members are contained in the official meeting file. \nPresenter(s): Ingrid Johnston, Associate Vice-President (Research); Katharine Moore, Senior \nAdministrative Officer, Office of the Vice-President (Research) \nPurpose of the Proposal: Outdated policy will be rescinded/deleted, thereby aligning the University’s \npractices with current University of Alberta Policies and Procedures On-Line (UAPPOL) policy that has \nsuperseded the policies set out in the GFC Policy Manual. \nDiscussion: \nDr Johnston explained that this proposal relates to the deletion of outdated policy, which is now adequately \naddressed within policies currently set out in UAPPO). \nMotion: More/Nocente \nGFC Executive Committee 09/08/2014 \nPage 4 \nTHAT the GFC Executive Committee approve, under delegated authority from General Faculties \nCouncil, the deletion of Section 116 (Trust Funds) of the GFC Policy Manual, as submitted by the Offices \nof the Vice-President (Research), Vice-President (Advancement), and Vice-President (Finance and \nAdministration) and as set forth in Attachment 1, to take effect upon final approval. \nCARRIED \n7.

Draft Agenda for the September 22, 2014 Meeting of General Faculties Council (GFC) and Proposal \nfrom the President Regarding Revitalization of Discussion at GFC Meetings  \nMaterials before members are contained in the official meeting file. \nGFC Executive Committee 09/08/2014 \nPage 6 \nPresenter(s): Indira Samarasekera, President and Chair, General Faculties Council; Carl Amrhein, Provost \nand Vice-President (Academic) and Chair, GFC Executive Committee; Catherine Swindlehurst, Director, \nOffice of the President \nPurpose of the Proposal: To discuss a proposal from the President with regard to revitalizing discussion at \nmeetings of GFC; and to approve the Agenda for the next GFC meeting to be held on Monday, September \n22, 2014. \nDiscussion: \nDr Samarasekera introduced the topic of revitalizing debate at General Faculties Council (GFC) to \nmembers.  She noted that the perceived lack of substantive debate at Council meetings seems to be a \nconstant criticism of GFC and that members of the academy want more opportunity to discuss and debate \nideas at Council meetings.  She stated that ‘Question Period’, as currently structured, does not provide the \nforum for the engagement of members on stimulating issues.  Dr Samarasekera provided a brief summary \nof her proposal (which was before members) to introduce a 30-minute structured debate period at future \nGFC meetings.  She added that members of the GFC Executive Committee were being asked on this \noccasion to determine how this proposal unfolds.  She commented that only large, academy-wide issues \nwould be placed before GFC and that there would be individuals pre-determined to represent both sides on \nany issues before Council, possibly with a short written submission to accompany the GFC agenda so that \nmembers would have time to thoughtfully consider the topic prior to the discussion.  Dr Samarasekera \nstated that she would like to see this trialed at the November, 2014 GFC meeting.  She explained that \ntopics would be constructive and lead to a robust and inclusive debate, rather than one-sided criticisms \nagainst particular GFC and/or University stakeholders; similarly, she envisioned that discussion/debate \nwould not result in any Motions (as is consistent with the GFC procedures around the ‘Discussion’ section \nof the GFC agenda) but could result in items for administration to consider and bring back for further \ndiscussion at GFC. \nDuring the ensuing discussion of this proposal, members expressed a number of comments and questions, \nincluding, but limited to:  commentary that GFC’s ‘Question Period’ is valuable as it allows for questioning \non a range of topics and anyone on Council can participate; support for the idea, as presented, and \nsupport, as well, for continuing with ‘Question Period’; that proposals from the Administration on a range of \ntopics could be forwarded to GFC for discussion before they were ‘polished’; concern that a discussion \nperiod could become mechanical in nature; concern with the technicalities of banning Motions during such \ndebates; that the GFC Executive Committee should frame this idea carefully; that there could be an \nopportunity for well-organized two-sided presentations as part of these particular discussions; that such \ndiscussions could be flexibly scheduled, appearing on GFC agendas that could comfortably accommodate \nthem; a suggestion to provide reports from different Vice-Presidents and allow questions about those \nreports at each GFC meeting; additional expressions of support for this proposal; clarification regarding the \nfate of ‘Question Period’; and clarification surrounding time allocation at GFC. \nThe Chair proposed that the President apprise members of GFC on this proposal in her opening comments \nat the September 22, 2014 meeting of GFC. \nThe President thanked members for their consideration of her proposal and, at this point, excused herself \nfrom the meeting. \nIn relation to the September 22, 2014 GFC Agenda, the Chair proposed that a new item could be added as \nan update to the Administration’s response to the Report of the Renaissance Committee and that this could \nbe viewed as a ‘trial’ of a possible ‘big’ discussion item.   \nGFC Executive Committee 09/08/2014 \nPage 7 \nMembers provided a number of comments and questions in relation the draft Agenda, including, but not \nlimited to: clarification surrounding the method by which specific topics from the Report of the Renaissance \nCommittee would be placed before members of GFC, given the large number of recommendations \ncontained within that report; whether material on this issue would be available in time for the September, \n2014 GFC meeting, along with the suggestion to direct members to existing material available online; \nclarification surrounding submitted questions to ‘Question Period’; and clarification surrounding the \nabsence of an October, 2014 meeting in the 2014-2015 GFC meeting schedule. \nMr Bodnar suggested that a smaller Working Group, comprising several members of the GFC Executive \nCommittee, be created to possibly establish procedures surrounding the proposed discussion period.  In \nresponse to this suggestion, several members volunteered to serve, including: Mr Colin More, Ms Lisa \nCollins, Professor Steve Patten, and Mr Fahim Rahman. \nMotion: Collins/Robertson \nTHAT the GFC Executive Committee approve, under delegated authority from General Faculties Council, \nthe Agenda for the September 22, 2014 meeting of General Faculties Council (GFC). \nCARRIED \nDISCUSSION ITEMS \n11. Annual Conduct Statistics Report from Residence Services (September 1, 2013 – May 1, 2014)  \nMaterials before members are contained in the official meeting file. \nPresenter(s): Brock Richardson, Acting Assistant Dean of Students – Residence Life, Residence Services; \nChris Fukushima, Residence Area Coordinator, East Campus, Residence Services \nPurpose of the Proposal: To report on residence conduct statistics from September 1, 2013 to May 1, \n2014. \nDiscussion: \nMr Fukushima provided members with key findings set out in the Annual Conduct Statistics Report from \nResidence Services and emphasized that the introduction of the Restorative Justice processes and mid-\nlevel meetings has resulted in an increased capacity to respond early and appropriately to residence \nconduct issues at the University of Alberta.  He also noted that an increase of staff may have also been an \nimportant factor in this. \nMembers, during the discussion surrounding this report, expressed a number of comments and questions, \nincluding, but not limited to:  clarification about the ‘French Contract’ deployed in the residence at Campus \nSaint-Jean and whether or not the students living in this facility support it; clarification surrounding \nbiohazard violations; commendation to the team for the success of the Restorative Justice program and \nlevels of participation in it; clarification about the model of Restorative Justice; and a request for an \nexample of a common incident and the corresponding response from Residence staff. \n12.

Recording Lectures - Proposed Changes to Section 23.4 (Evaluation Procedures and Grading \nSystem) of the University Calendar  \nMaterials before members are contained in the official meeting file. \nPresenter(s): Brenda Leskiw, Chair, GFC Academic Standards Committee (and Associate Vice-Provost \n(Academic Programs and Instruction)); Sheree Kwong See, Director, Centre for Teaching and Learning \nGFC Executive Committee 11/12/2014 \nPage 3 \nPurpose of the Proposal: To update the required statement in course outlines detailing recording of course \ncontent to reflect changes in the learning environment. Since the original wording was proposed to Section \n23.4 (Evaluation Procedures and Grading System) of the University Calendar, students and instructors are \nmore actively engaged in creating digital content, and this content is in need of safeguarding. Further \nclarification is needed in the wording to outline the conditions under which such material can be used and \nthe permissions required for use. \nDiscussion: \nDr Leskiw provided members with a brief introduction of this item, noting that the proposed changes to \nSection 23.4 of the University Calendar were reviewed and recommended recently by members of the GFC \nAcademic Standards Committee (ASC).   \nDr Kwong See reported that the current wording of Section 23.4 tends to focus on students and materials, \nbut does not reflect the new realities of the digital learning environment.  She stated that during the process \nof developing this proposal, she had engaged in wide consultation.  \nDuring the discussion surrounding this proposal, members provided a number of comments and questions, \nincluding, but not limited to: clarification regarding content which may require safeguarding; whether \nuploading to YouTube transfers copyright to YouTube; that there are concerns about student privacy in \nclassrooms where sessions are recorded, and whether asking students for consent would stifle discussion; \nclarification on how this policy revision would be communicated and enforced; whether there are existing \npolicies in relation to recording lectures; clarification on existing privacy laws in relation to recording \nindividuals’ conversations; expressions of support for this proposal, with reference to the larger issues at \nplay, including concern that resources have to be posted on a secure media server; that privacy laws do \nnot translate easily into the area of copyright; whether the issue of copyright should be addressed; whether \nstudents waive copyright on their own comments; that this policy could include a link to the other policies \nsurrounding intellectual property; whether student comments constitute content; that there is no obligation \nto record classes; and clarification regarding ethics approval in relation to recorded classroom activities \nused subsequently for research purposes.  \nMotion:  Nocente/Robertson                                                                                                 (Opposed:  Elliott)                                                                                                                        \nTHAT the GFC Executive Committee approve, under delegated authority from General Faculties Council, \nproposed changes to Section 23.4 (Evaluation Procedures and Grading System) of the University \nCalendar, as submitted by the Director of the Centre for Teaching and Learning and as set forth in \nAttachment 1, to be effective upon approval. \nCARRIED \n5. Clarifying the Procedure for Handling Complaints of Research and Scholarship Misconduct Lodged \nAgainst Students – Proposed Changes to Sections 30.3.2(4) and 30.6.2(4) of the Code of Student \nBehaviour  \nMaterials before members are contained in the official meeting file. \nPresenter: Joanna Harrington, Associate Dean, Faculty of Graduate Studies and Research \nPurpose of the Proposal: To remove the confusion for students, professors, Associate Chairs (Graduate \nStudies), the Student OmbudService (SOS), Associate Deans, and the Discipline Officers that currently \nexists as to the procedure to be followed when investigating and adjudicating a complaint of research and \nscholarship misconduct that has been lodged against a student (usually a graduate student) and to ensure \nGFC Executive Committee 11/12/2014 \nPage 4 \nthat the same procedure is followed for dealing with the academic offence of research and scholarship \nmisconduct vis-à-vis a student as with other kinds of academic offences (such as plagiarism and cheating). \nDiscussion: \nDr Harrington provided members with a brief summary of this proposal, noting that the proposed changes \nto the Code of Student Behaviour, with corresponding changes to the UAPPOL Research and Scholarship \nIntegrity Policy and its associated procedures (as set out in Agenda Item 6 before members), will serve to \nremove confusion and clarify the procedure to be followed when investigating and adjudicating a complaint \nof research and scholarship misconduct lodged against a student. She stated that the proposal’s intent is to \nremove confusion for students as well as those who teach and advise them. \nMotion:  Patten/Orydzuk \nTHAT the GFC Executive Committee approve, under delegated authority from General Faculties Council, \nproposed changes to the Code of Student Behaviour (Sections 30.3.2(4) (Offences Under the \nCode/Research and Scholarship Misconduct) and 30.6.2(4) (Procedures for Appeal of Decisions to the \nUniversity Appeal Board (UAB)/Terms of Reference and Powers), as submitted by the Faculty of \nGraduate Studies and Research (FGSR) and as set forth in Attachment 1, to take effect upon final \napproval. \nCARRIED \n6. Proposed Revisions from the Office of the Vice-President (Research) to the UAPPOL Research and \nScholarship Integrity Policy  \nMaterials before members are contained in the official meeting file. \nPresenter(s): Lorne Babiuk, Vice-President (Research); Lynn Penrod, Executive Director, Research Ethics \nOffice \nPurpose of the Proposal: To revise UAPPOL policy and procedure related to research and scholarship \nintegrity so that it aligns with the changes to the Code of Student Behaviour considered on this occasion by \nthe GFC Executive Committee (as set out in Agenda Item 5 before members).  The current wording in the \nCode of Student Behaviour and in the UAPPOL Research and Scholarship Integrity Policy is somewhat \nambiguous, and (proposed) changes to both the Code and the UAPPOL make it clear that any students in \nthis situation would be handled under processes contained in the Code. \nDiscussion: \nDr Babiuk explained that, as per the now-approved proposal to amend Sections 30.3.2(4) and 30.6.2(4) of \nthe Code of Student Behaviour (see Item 5 above), this proposal contains consequential changes to the \nUAPPOL Research and Scholarship Integrity Policy and its procedures, all of which will serve to remove \ncurrent ambiguities and alleviate confusion for students, faculty, and staff. \nMotion:  Rodgers/Robertson \nTHAT the GFC Executive Committee, under delegated authority from General Faculties Council, \nrecommend to the Board Learning and Discovery Committee proposed changes to the UAPPOL \nResearch and Scholarship Integrity Policy, as submitted by the Office of the Vice-President (Research) \nand as set forth in Attachment 1, to take effect upon final approval. \nCARRIED \nGFC Executive Committee 11/12/2014 \nPage 5 \n7. 2015-2016 Academic Schedule  \nMaterials before members are contained in the official meeting file. \nPresenter(s): Ada Ness, Associate Registrar (Enrolment Services), Office of the Registrar; Anna Vocioni, \nAssistant Registrar, Office of the Registrar \nPurpose of the Proposal: To provide deadline dates for the 2015-2016 Academic Year. \nDiscussion: \nMs Ness introduced herself and Ms Vocioni to members and explained that the GFC Executive Committee \nconsiders the annual Academic Schedule for approval each year.  She highlighted the inclusion, for the first \ntime, of the Fall Term Reading Week in the 2015-2016 Academic Schedule. \nMembers, during the discussion in relation to this item, expressed a number of comments and questions, \nincluding, but not limited to:  a suggestion for a minor revision to punctuation on page 5 of the document \n(which was accepted by the proposers and by members as a ‘friendly amendment’); clarification \nsurrounding the number of required lectures for Faculties which are externally accredited; clarification \nrelating to the deadline to opt out of the Fall Term Reading Week; confirmation that the Dean of the Faculty \nof Engineering is supportive of Fall Term Reading Week; expressions of support for the inclusion of the Fall \nTerm Reading Week; commentary that teaching before Labour Day is not advisable; clarification that this \nproposal is not intended to approve the inclusion of a Fall Term Reading Week, as this matter had a \nseparate approval route and is already deemed approved; that the dates of the Fall Term Reading Week \nmay change each year, depending on the Academic Schedule under consideration; and commendation for \nthe work that went into the preparation of this proposal and the supporting documentation provided. \nMotion:  Orydzuk/Nocente \nTHAT the GFC Executive Committee approve, under delegated authority from General Faculties \nCouncil, the Academic Schedule for 2015-2016, as submitted by the Vice-Provost and University \nRegistrar and as set forth in Attachment 5, and, in doing so, empower the Registrar to make any editorial \nchanges as needed as long as the changes do not have the force of policy, to be effective upon final \napproval. \nCARRIED \n8. Proposed Changes to the Composition of the Selection/Review Committees for the Dean of the \nFaculty of Arts  \nMaterials before members are contained in the official meeting file. \nPresenter(s): Carl Amrhein, Provost and Vice-President (Academic) and Chair, GFC Executive Committee; \nKathleen Brough, Portfolio Initiatives Manager, Office of the Provost and Vice-President (Academic) \nPurpose of the Proposal: To amend UAPPOL Composition of Dean Selection and Review Committees for \nIndividual Faculties (Appendix A), Faculty of Arts, of the UAPPOL Faculty Deans Selection Procedure, with \nan update to the name of the student association in the Faculty of Arts and the removal of reference to the \nArts Administrators Council as the mechanism by which the Administrative Professional Officer (APO) is \nchosen for the Committee. Not all APOs in the Faculty of Arts now sit on the Council. \nDiscussion: \nGFC Executive Committee 11/12/2014 \nPage 6 \nMs Brough explained that the changes within this proposal are minor and relate to updating the name of \nthe student association in the Faculty of Arts and removing reference to the Arts Administrative Council as \nthe body which choses the APO to serve on selection or review committees for the Dean of the Faculty of \nArts. \nA member enquired whether the Faculty will be conducting electronic votes to populate these committees \n(when struck).  Another member suggested that it is wise to not constrain how the voting is carried out \nwithin the Faculty. \nMotion: Rahman/More \nTHAT the GFC Executive Committee approve, under delegated authority from the Board of Governors \nand General Faculties Council, proposed changes to the composition of the Selection and Review \nCommittees for the Dean of the Faculty of Arts, as submitted by the Office of the Provost and Vice-\nPresident (Academic) and as set forth in Attachment 1, to take effect upon final approval. \nCARRIED \n9. Draft Agenda for the November 24, 2014 Meeting of General Faculties Council (GFC)  \nMaterials before members are contained in the official meeting file. \nPresenter: Carl Amrhein, Provost and Vice-President (Academic) and Chair, GFC Executive Committee \nPurpose of the Proposal: To approve the Agenda for the next GFC meeting to be held on Monday, \nNovember 24, 2014. \nDiscussion: \nDr Amrhein invited members to review the draft Agenda for the November 24, 2014 meeting of General \nFaculties Council (GFC), adding that GFC member Professor Carolyn Sale’s request for a presentation on \nthe new University of Alberta Budget Model, made at the last meeting of Council held on September 22, \n2014, would not be accommodated, as there were no further details to provide at this point in time and, \nfurther, a ‘Town Hall’ was being considered by the Senior Administration in relation to this specific topic. \nMembers provided a number of comments and questions in relation to the draft Agenda, including, but not \nlimited to:  clarification on how an emergency GFC meeting would be organized; whether the budget item \nconstitutes an emergency; the suggestion that a new institutional budget model should come before GFC, \nnot just the Board of Governors; expressions of support for a ‘Town Hall’ format; and a suggestion to \ninclude this explanation at the GFC meeting. \nThe Chair, in response to the final point raised, noted that Ms Phyllis Clark could provide this explanation at \nthe November GFC meeting. \nMotion: Orydzuk/Rodgers \nTHAT the GFC Executive Committee approve, under delegated authority from General Faculties Council, \nthe Agenda for the November 24, 2014 meeting of General Faculties Council (GFC), as set forth in \nAttachment 1. \nCARRIED \nDISCUSSION ITEMS \nGFC Executive Committee 11/12/2014 \nPage 7 \n10. Discussion Topics for Meetings of General Faculties Council (GFC) – Report of the Ad Hoc Working \nGroup (of the GFC Executive Committee)  \nMaterials before members are contained in the official meeting file. \nPresenter(s): Colin More, Member, Ad Hoc Working Group on GFC Discussion (and Member, GFC \nExecutive Committee); Steve Patten, Member, Ad Hoc Working Group on GFC Discussion (and Member, \nGFC Executive Committee); Fahim Rahman, Member, Ad Hoc Working Group on GFC Discussion (and \nMember, GFC Executive Committee) \nPurpose of the Proposal: To discuss a report provided by members of the Ad Hoc Working Group (of the \nGFC Executive Committee) tasked with considering, in detail, a proposal submitted by President Indira \nSamarasekera (and Chair, General Faculties Council (GFC)) prior to the September 8, 2014 meeting of the \nGFC Executive Committee regarding revitalization of discussion at GFC meetings. The documentation \nbefore members (ie, specifically, Attachment 1) summarizes members’ discussion on this issue at a \nmeeting called on September 29, 2014 and provides a series of reflections on how such discussions, as \nenvisioned by the President, might occur at future Council meetings. The Working Group presents this item \nto the GFC Executive Committee for further discussion and, in addition, members will be asked to \ndetermine ‘next steps’ for this item, including possible discussion at the November 24, 2014 GFC meeting. \nDiscussion: \nMr More provided members with an outline of the Report, noting that the members of the Working Group \nachieved consensus on the proposal, except for the issue of the introduction of Motions during the \nproposed discussion period. \nProfessor Patten explained that the difficulty in making a final determination with regard to rules around \nMotions introduced during this proposed discussion period is that the GFC Executive Committee retains \ndelegated authority over the agendas for GFC and, therefore, should retain some level of control over the \nissues brought forward during this period as well as selecting individuals to speak to the issues.  He \nrecommended a soft approach to the issue of Motions, including clarifying that, as set out in her original \nproposal, Dr Samarasekera did not envision Motions allowed during the course of the discussion period \nand that attempts to introduce Motions could be subsequently managed by the Chair.  He noted, as well, \nthat it is difficult to know in advance how many of these discussion periods can be added to GFC agendas \nin a given academic year. \nMr Rahman added that the Working Group did not establish mechanisms for vetting proposals, Motions, \nand how to schedule items into the discussion period. \nMembers provided a number of comments and questions in relation to this item, including, but not limited \nto:  that members may want to introduce Motions as a way to act on issues and that a mechanism to pre-\nempt this could be built into the rules surrounding the discussion period; a suggestion to present GFC \nmembers with these outstanding questions; clarification regarding the procedural rules of GFC in relation to \nthe introduction of Motions; that banning Motions outright will create other problematic issues and a \nsuggestion to clearly describe the mandate of this discussion period by explaining that it is about \ndiscussion and debate, not decision-making; and clarification on the best method to present the Report to \nmembers of GFC. \nThe Chair requested that a member of the Working Group summarize the exact proposal, so that it can be \npresented to GFC.     \nMr Bodnar provided members with advice regarding the presentation of the proposal at GFC. \nGFC Executive Committee 11/12/2014 \nPage 8 \n11. Goals (2014-2015) of the Students’ Union (SU) and the Graduate Students’ Association (GSA) – \nBrief Introduction  \n11.1 Goals from the Students’ Union (SU)  \nMaterials before members are contained in the official meeting file. \nPresenter: William Lau, President, Students’ Union (SU) \nPurpose of the Proposal: To communicate to the Board Learning and Discovery Committee (BLDC), the \nGFC Executive Committee, and General Faculties Council (GFC) the SU’s goals for the year (2014-2015) \nand how the SU Executive team plans to improve the life of students at the University of \nAlberta. \nDiscussion: \nMr Lau introduced himself to members and explained that the material provided clearly explains the \nStudents’ Union (SU) five key goals for 2014-15.  He provided members with more details in relation to \nthese goals, under the categories of:  Student Success; Affordability; Engaging Community; Growing \nPartnerships; and Building a Better Students’ Union.  \nHe explained that another focus will be on open educational resources, and Ms Orydzuk added that they \nhave instituted a campaign directed towards students and instructors in relation to electronic teaching \nmaterials, access codes to additional course resources, and working with Libraries to ensure that electronic \ntextbooks are available in the Libraries. She explained that the cost for access codes is onerous to \nstudents. \nMr Lau stated that they have focused on assessing their communication strategy towards the student body.  \nHe explained that the SU will attempt to broaden relationships with key partners with an aim to write a \nwhite paper about the undergraduate student experience.   \nDuring the discussion surrounding this item, members expressed a number of comments and questions, \nincluding, but not limited to:  clarification regarding the issues surrounding access codes; that there has \nbeen negative feedback from students with respect to e-resource materials and that affordability does not \nalways translate into better quality of education, according to Universal Student Ratings of Instruction \n(USRI) responses; clarification whether this discussion relates to open source textbooks or a publisher’s \nonline version of a textbook, as there is a difference between the two versions; that the platform for usage \nis usually problematic, as opposed to content; clarification surrounding how the SU will evaluate success \nfor these goals; and clarification on how the SU intends to increase more women within their organization. \n11.2 Goals from the Graduate Students' Association (GSA)  \nMaterials before members are contained in the official meeting file. \nPresenter: Nathan Andrews, President, Graduate Students’ Association (GSA) \nPurpose of the Proposal: To brief the Board Learning and Discovery Committee (BLDC), the GFC \nExecutive Committee, and General Faculties Council (GFC) on the key priorities for 2014-2015 identified \nby the GSA in its Strategic Work Plan (SWP). \nDiscussion: \nGFC Executive Committee 11/12/2014 \nPage 9 \nMr Andrews thanked members for their attention and provided them with a summary of the Graduate \nStudents’ Association (GSA) goals for 2014-15, including:  creating professional development opportunities \nfor graduate students; continued engagement surrounding financial support of post-secondary education; \nsupport for a strong Faculty of Graduate Studies and Research; continued partnerships in relation to the \nitems on the Final Report of the Graduate Student Supervision Task Force; increased services for \ninternational students; maintaining a strong advocacy presence in the areas of Municipal, Provincial and \nFederal Governments; and continued work with the University surrounding education, compliance, and \ndispute resolution associated with the Collective Agreement. He also noted that the GSA strives to \nmaintain their Bylaws and has created a successful program for graduate students to achieve training \nsurrounding governance and leadership. \n12. Dare to Discover (D2D) Report Card – Academic Year 2013-2014  \nMaterials before members are contained in the official meeting file. \nPresenter: Anne Bailey, Director, Internal Communications, Office of the Vice-President (University \nRelations) \nPurpose of the Proposal: The Dare to Discover (D2D) Report Card – Academic Year 2013-2014 provides \nan overview of the many and diverse initiatives undertaken at the University of Alberta between April 1, \n2013 and March 31, 2014, including qualitative and quantitative indicators of our progress against Board of \nGovernors’ metrics.  The primary audience for the Report Card is the Board of Governors, but it is a public \ndocument that is distributed widely. This discussion is an opportunity for the GFC Executive Committee to \nlearn more about some of the aforementioned University initiatives indicators used to measure institutional \nprogress against relevant metrics. \nDiscussion: \nMs Bailey provided an overview of the Report Card to members, adding that this document is submitted on \nan annual basis to the Board of Governors.  She stated that the Report Card contains status updates \nsurrounding the goals within Dare to Discover and sets out various examples from a number of the \nFaculties on how those strategic goals are being achieved across the campuses of the University of \nAlberta. \nMs Bailey continuing by providing members with a summary of the main content of the Report Card and \nexplained that the document, in its final form, is in digital format only, located on the President’s website.  \nDuring the discussion surrounding this Report, members provided a number of comments and questions, \nincluding, but not limited to:  clarification surrounding the term “substantial student impact”; commendation \non the document; that the Report Card could include more with regard to teaching and learning; \ncommentary that there is not yet evidence that the Peter Lougheed Leadership College will benefit \nstudents; whether changes can be made to the document at this point; that the Students’ Union (SU) would \nlike to make suggestions on the content of next year’s version of the document; that this Report contains \nimpressive facts but that quick growth can sometimes be unsustainable; whether institutional rankings \nshould be a consideration; clarification on how achievements are selected for inclusion within this Report \nCard; clarification with regard to the capitalization of the word “Indigenous” in the document; a suggestion \nto remove the term “aboriginal” from the document; and clarification surrounding the comparisons to \nAmerican universities in the document. \nMs Bailey thanked members for their comments and indicated she would make note of them for possible \nfuture iterations of the document, although she acknowledged this may be the last Report Card produced \nprior to the end of Dr Samarasekera’s presidency. \nGFC Executive Committee 11/12/2014 \nPage 10 \n13. Waiver of Advertising Requirements: Report to General Faculties Council  \nMaterials before members are contained in the official meeting file. \nPresenter: Carl Amrhein, Provost and Vice-President (Academic) and Chair, GFC Executive Committee \nPurpose of the Proposal: This report fulfills General Faculties Council (GFC) reporting requirements. \nDiscussion: \nThe Chair provided members with a brief summary of the Report, adding that the current trend towards the \nlow number of waivers is an unhealthy sign of the state of the University’s staff complement and \nrecruitment thereof. \nA member noted that Faculties are losing Administrative Professional Officer (APO) positions and that this, \nin his opinion, has been detrimental to the affected units. \n14.

Comments from the Chair  \nThe Chair commented on a number of relevant issues to members. \nGFC Executive Committee 01/12/2015 \nPage 3 \nACTION ITEMS \n4. Proposal from the Office of the Vice-President (Research) and the Faculty of Graduate Studies and \nResearch to Create the UAPPOL Delay of Research Publication Procedure (with the Attendant \nDeletion of GFC Policy Manual Sections 96.1.1, 96.1.2, 96.1.3, 96.1.4, and 120.2) \nMaterials before members are contained in the official meeting file. \nPresenters: Glen Baker, Associate Vice-President (Research); Joanna Harrington, Associate Dean, Faculty \nof Graduate Studies and Research (FGSR) \nPurpose of the Proposal: To create a new UAPPOL procedure and to delete several attendant \nsub-sections of the GFC Policy Manual (ie, replaces GFC Policy Manual Sections 96.1.1, 96.1.2, 96.1.3, \n96.1.4, and 120.2); all references to the maximum period of delay for various types of research publications \nwill be contained in one UAPPOL procedure.  The reference to the delay/restricting access to the \npublication of theses will remain in the University Calendar, where the procedure for requesting a delay \nbeyond 12 months is outlined. \nDiscussion: \nDr Baker provided members with a brief summary of the proposal, adding that it is the result of \nconsiderable work and consultation carried out by the Office of the Vice-President (Research) and the \nFaculty of Graduate Studies and Research (FGSR). He noted that these changes reflect the complexities \nof clinical trials, which often slow down the analysis process.  He reported that there was a small working \ngroup established to discuss research publication delays and that the corresponding changes within the \nproposal represent their final recommendations. \nDr Harrington noted that the practices contained within the proposal are already standard for members of \nFGSR and that this is reflected in the appropriate regulations set out in the University Calendar.  She \nadded that it is also reflects in many ways what is standard practice at other western Canadian universities.  \nMembers, during the discussion surrounding this proposal, provided a number of comments and questions, \nincluding, but not limited to: clarification surrounding restrictions and sources of requests in relation to \ntheses and patenting; expressions of support for this proposal; and clarification as to whether the requests \nfor extensions were fairly straightforward. \nMotion: White/Rodgers \nTHAT the GFC Executive Committee approve, under delegated authority from the General \nFaculties Council, the new UAPPOL Delay of Research Publication Procedure, as submitted by the \nOffice of the Vice-President (Research) and the Faculty of Graduate Studies and Research and as set \nforth in Attachment 1, as well as the attendant deletion of GFC Policy Manual Sections 96.1.1, 96.1.2, \n96.1.3, 96.1.4, and 120.2 (as noted in Attachment 3). \nCARRIED \n5. Deletion of Section 65.3 (University of Alberta Student Housing Policy) from the GFC Policy Manual  \nMaterials before members are contained in the official meeting file. \nPresenter: Doug Dawson, Associate Vice-President (Ancillary Services), Facilities and Operations \nGFC Executive Committee 01/12/2015 \nPage 4 \nPurpose of the Proposal: To delete Section 65.3 of the GFC Policy Manual. The items referenced in this \nsection are outdated or historical in nature and current information is available in web and print sources.  In \naddition, this proposal facilitates the process of migrating material from the GFC Policy Manual and \nreducing redundancy across institutional policy documents.  Outdated policy will be rescinded/deleted, \nthereby aligning the University’s practices with current UAPPOL policy and operating practices, which have \nsuperseded the policies set out in the GFC Policy Manual. \nDiscussion: \nMr Dawson summarized the proposal by explaining that current provisions regarding student housing \nreside in University practice and policy and that, as a result of this, Section 65.3 of the GFC Policy Manual \nis now deemed redundant.   \nMs Orydzuk requested permission for a Visitor to speak on behalf of this item, and the Chair, who had \nbeen apprised of this request prior to the start of the meeting, consented. Mr Nicholas Diaz, Vice-President \n(Student Life), Students’ Union (SU), introduced himself to members and thanked the Chair for the \nopportunity to speak.  Mr Diaz noted that the Post-Secondary Learning Act grants legislative authority to \nGFC to make residence policy, with approval from the Board of Governors.  He cautioned members that \napproving this proposal as presented eliminates the opportunity of investigating an appropriate \nreplacement institutional policy surrounding student housing. \nMembers, during the discussion of this proposal, provided a number of comments and questions, including, \nbut not limited to: that GFC has engaged in broad review and discussion of this matter recently; that \ndeleting this policy and relying, instead, on numerous other digital sources for policy and process, such as \nwebsites, is not the same as having one comprehensive policy and that these external sources of \ninformation lack legislative authority; that enforcement is an issue and that the replacement sources do not \naccurately reflect the policy language; that it does not seem to make sense to delete one source of policy \nand spread it out over 13 different sources and that it is easier for students and administrators to have one \nplace to reference this policy; that there is a difference between policy statements, themselves, and how \nsuch policies are administered; that the Residence Community Standards relate more to judicial matters, \nso that there is a discontinuity between what is being deleted and what currently exists; a suggestion to \nrevise the existing policy; that the (proposed) deletion of sections of the GFC Policy Manual usually \naccompany proposals to transition the “old” policy into the UAPPOL environment; that it might be beneficial \nto review how GFC has delegated its powers over residences before proceeding; that this proposal \nappears not to be routine or urgent; and commentary that stakeholders have indicated that they are \nuncomfortable with this proposal and that there should be, instead, a replacement (updated) policy created \nand presented to full GFC. \nMr Bodnar reminded members that the GFC Executive Committee does have delegated authority from \nGFC over this matter, as set out in the proposal (and accompanying legislation) before the Committee. \nThe Chair, noting the nature of the discussion, suggested it might be wise at this time to table this item.  Dr \nElliott, in setting forth a 'Motion to Table', was afforded an opportunity, as set out within GFC's procedural \nrules, to make clear what his expectations were to move this proposal off the table and back to the \nCommittee for discussion.  He noted that he expected the existing policy would be replaced with a new, \ncurrent policy, created after consultation with key stakeholders.  The proposer, according to GFC's \nprocedural rules, was also allowed the opportunity to say what effect tabling the proposal would have; Mr \nDawson, when asked, declined to provide any further commentary. \nMotion: Elliott/More \nGFC Executive Committee 01/12/2015 \nPage 5 \nTHAT the GFC Executive Committee TABLE the proposed deletion of GFC Policy Manual Section 65.3 \n(University of Alberta Student Housing Policy), as originally submitted by Facilities and Operations. \nCARRIED \n6. Proposed Changes from the Office of the Registrar to Embedded Certificate Parchments  \nMaterials before members are contained in the official meeting file. \nPresenters: Lisa Collins, Vice-Provost and University Registrar; Corinne Callihoo, Assistant Registrar \n(Convocation and Ceremonies), Office of the Registrar \nPurpose of the Proposal: As a result of recent discussion with Provincial Government colleagues, it has \nbeen brought to the University’s attention that embedded credit certificates are not significantly \ndifferentiated from our freestanding credit certificates. Since embedded certificates do not require \nGovernment approval, it is recommended that the presentation of the embedded certificates be modified to \nvisually differentiate them from freestanding certificates that do receive governmental approval.  In addition, \nthe new design visually differentiates an embedded certificate from the parchment awarded students for \ncompletion of degree or diploma programs. As per UAPPOL policy, any substantive changes to \nparchments must be approved through the GFC Executive Committee.  The redesign will remove the coat \nof arms from the embedded certificate parchment and change the signatures from four (President, \nChancellor, Registrar, and Board Chair) to two (Registrar and Dean of the Faculty in which the certificate is \noffered). \nDiscussion: \nMs Collins reported to members that the Provincial Government has requested that the University of \nAlberta create a separate parchment for the completion of embedded certificate programs, as such \ncertificates are not recognized by the Government and should not be seen in the same light as the \nparchments awarded students for their completion of a diploma or degree program.  She stated that, in \nresponse to this request, Ms Callihoo created a working group to design such a document. \nMs Callihoo explained that offering a credential document to those completing certificate programs was \nformerly the responsibility of the individual Faculties and that, eventually, the Office of the Registrar was \nasked to participate in generating the document.  She noted that the new design for the embedded \ncertificates does not resemble a parchment and that it is their hope that the Provincial Government will \nagree to this new document. \nMembers, during the discussion in relation to this item, offered a number of comments and questions, \nincluding, but not limited to:  clarification regarding examples of an embedded certificate program; that the \nreasoning for the redesign seems unclear; and a query whether the Provincial Government has had an \nopportunity to review the latest iteration of the design. \nMotion:  Robertson/Molzahn \nTHAT the GFC Executive Committee approve, under delegated authority from General Faculties \nCouncil, the proposed changes to Embedded Certificate Parchments, as provided by the Office of the \nRegistrar and as set forth in Attachment 1, to be effective upon final approval. \nCARRIED \n7. Proposed Changes to the Composition of the Selection/Review Committees for the Dean of Faculté \nGFC Executive Committee 01/12/2015 \nPage 6 \nSaint-Jean  \nMaterials before members are contained in the official meeting file. \nPresenters: Olive Yonge, Interim Provost and Vice-President (Academic) and Chair, GFC Executive \nCommittee; Kathleen Brough, Senior Administrative Officer, Office of the Provost and Vice-President \n(Academic) \nPurpose of the Proposal: To amend UAPPOL Composition of Dean Selection and Review Committees for \nIndividual Faculties (Appendix A), Faculté Saint-Jean, of the UAPPOL Faculty Deans Selection Procedure, \nupdating categories to add a representative from Staff Category A2.1 (contract academic staff instructor) to \nthe Committee. \nDiscussion: \nMs Brough explained that this proposal contains one element and that is to add a contract teaching staff \nmember to the Committee. \nA member enquired about the number of contract teaching staff at Faculté Saint-Jean. \nMotion: Molzahn/Collins \nTHAT the GFC Executive Committee approve, under delegated authority from the Board of Governors \nand General Faculties Council, proposed changes to the composition of the Selection and Review \nCommittees for the Dean of Faculté Saint-Jean, as submitted by the Office of the Provost and Vice-\nPresident (Academic) and as set forth in Attachment 1, to take effect upon final approval. \nCARRIED \n8.

Helping Individuals at Risk and Safe Disclosure and Human Rights Activity Reports 2013-2014  \nMaterials before members are contained in the official meeting file. \nPresenter: Mary Persson, Associate Vice-President (Audit and Analysis) \nPurpose of the Proposal: In 2008, the University introduced the Office of Safe Disclosure and Human \nRights (SDHR) as an intake office for issues arising under the Ethical Conduct and Safe Disclosure Policy. \nOrganizationally, the Office reports to the University Auditor to promote the independent, neutral, and \nadvisory nature of the function. \nIn 2010, the Helping Individuals at Risk Policy (HIAR) was introduced and an intake function was created to \nwork in conjunction with the Office of SDHR. The policy requires that annual reporting to General Faculties \nCouncil (GFC) and to the Board of Governors will occur after each year of operation. \nThe purpose of the two reports before members is to provide an overview of the activities of each office \nand to comment on trends and issues as well as to provide information on strategies for dealing with them. \nDiscussion: \nMs Persson provided members with a summary of the annual reports before them.  She explained that the \ncurrent data suggests that the offices act primarily in advisory roles, as opposed to complaint-handling \nroles, and that, further to this trend, these offices work closely with the Dean of Students to ensure that \ntheir programs are responsive and effective. She noted, as well, that the resources of the programs offered \nare being monitored to ensure that they are properly resourced. \nMembers expressed a number of questions and comments in relation to this report, including, but not \nlimited to: clarification surrounding the reasons why complaints have decreased; whether non-criminal \ndeaths on campus are included in this report; and clarification regarding information on international \nstudents set out within the report.  \n10.

In \nthis case, the report files is the ‘University of Alberta Museums Annual Report to General Faculties Council \n(GFC) for the Period July 1, 2013 – October 31, 2014’. \nDiscussion: \nMs Andrews provided members with highlights from the Annual Report, noting that, as funding runs out in \n2016, there has been a focus on resources allocated to the Enterprise Square gallery.  She provided \ncommentary, in addition, on a number of important projects from the last year, including the completion of \nan inventory of human remains on campus; a review of the acquisition strategy of the institution; the goal to \nmaintain the current designation “A” status for the University’s collections; the wish to obtain a curatorial \nresearch museum; the completion of staff reorganization; and the deaccession of items from the Dentistry \ncollection.   \nGFC Executive Committee 01/12/2015 \nPage 8 \nDuring the discussion surrounding this Report, members provided a number of comments and questions, \nincluding, but not limited to: clarification surrounding what the most pressing issue is currently for Museums \nand Collection Services; clarification on where decommissioned items go after removal from collections; \nand expressions of commendation for the Report. \n11. Annual Report on Undergraduate Enrolment 2014/15  \nMaterials before members are contained in the official meeting file. \nPresenters: Lisa Collins, Vice-Provost and University Registrar; Olive Yonge, Interim Provost and Vice-\nPresident (Academic) and Chair, GFC Executive Committee \nPurpose of the Proposal: To discuss the 2014/15 annual report on undergraduate enrolment. \nDiscussion: \nMs Collins explained that the Report has been adjusted according to feedback collected last year from \nmembers of the academy and that the primary objectives of this report are to track minimum admission \naverages and enrolment data in comparison to institutional and unit-specific targets and to provide \ninformation to the Faculties that assist them in future decision-making on enrolment management.  She \ncommented that, currently, some Faculties are under enrolled, while others are over enrolled.  \nShe stated that, although Chinese students represent a valued cohort of University of Alberta students, \nthere will be further focus on diversification in the future. \nShe explained that the Office of the Registrar is awaiting the decision from the Provincial Government on \nProvincial exam weighting and that, in addition, the conversation surrounding access continues. \nMs Collins provided members with a summary of the new offer acceptance process, which includes \noffering entrance awards at the time offers of admission are made to allow students to make better-\ninformed decisions. \nMembers, during the discussion surrounding the Report, provided a number of comments and questions, \nincluding, but not limited to:  clarification regarding the drop in completion rates; clarification regarding the \nnumbers of American students applying to the University of Alberta; clarification surrounding full-time \nstudent enrolment data; and clarification surrounding the data related to the applications from and \nenrolment of Chinese students. \n12. Student Mental Health and Wellness at the University of Alberta – Update  \nMaterials before members are contained in the official meeting file. \nPresenter: Robin Everall, Interim Vice-Provost and Dean of Students \nPurpose of the Proposal:  Given the ongoing importance of the issue of student mental health and wellness \nand the broad range of programs and initiatives that are ongoing at the University of Alberta, a presentation \nto General Faculties Council (GFC) to update the University community would be timely and useful.  \nKeeping the University community informed of a) the issue of mental health and wellness and b) what the \ninstitution is doing about it is crucially important.   \nA presentation to Council will: \nGFC Executive Committee 01/12/2015 \nPage 9 \n• Update all members of the community on the programs and initiatives underway; \n• Help raise awareness of what programs and services are available on campus; \n• Continue to lead the way in destigmatizing conversation around issues of mental health and wellness; \n• Continue to help establish support for a constructive and comprehensive approach to student mental \nhealth and wellness that will be proactive, effective, and sustainable over the long term. \nDiscussion: \nDr Everall explained that the issue of how to provide a supportive learning environment in terms of student \nmental health continues to be an important issue at the University of Alberta. She noted that, as academic \nsuccess and student mental health are tied together, there has been a philosophical shift in how the \ninstitution offers and delivers services and that there has been a shift, too, towards offering services in a \nmuch more timely manner to those in need. \nShe stated that the discussion also needs to factor in early intervention and academic support, as well as \nhelping individuals at risk; even though there are current structures in place addressing these issues,  \nstudents may not know about them. \nDuring the discussion in relation to this item, members expressed a number of comments and questions, \nincluding, but not limited to:  the status of continuing financial support from Alberta Health Services (AHS) \nfor mental health initiatives and services at the University of Alberta; whether the strategies currently in \nplace include better services for international students; and a suggestion to include in the GFC \npresentation more data about the prevalence of mental health issues in the institution’s current student \nbody. \nMs Swindlehurst, who was attending the meeting as an Observer, was invited by the Chair to explain to \nmembers that the Office of the President is interested in adding this important subject to the Agenda for \nGFC’s February 2, 2015 meeting, given the highlighted importance of student mental health for both the \nUniversity’s Board of Governors and the Senior Administration. \n13. Graduate Student Management Solution (GSMS) – Graduate Admissions Project  \nMaterials before members are contained in the official meeting file. \nPresenter: Mike MacGregor, Vice-Provost and Associate Vice-President (Information Technology)   \nPurpose of the Proposal: The Offices of the Vice-Provost and Associate Vice-President (Information \nTechnology) (VPIT), University Digital Strategies (UDS), and Faculty of Graduate Studies and Research \n(FGSR), in conjunction with the units offering graduate programs, initiated a project to review, change, and \nautomate all business processes concerning the graduate student application process at the University of \nAlberta. The primary objective is to acquire great students faster—to achieve that goal, the University is \nenabling a paperless solution.  The Graduate Admissions Project was deployed to improve the admissions \nprocess using a central, comprehensive, robust, and paperless admissions system that will enable users \n(student, administrative staff, and faculty) access to pertinent details. The Vice-Provost and Associate Vice-\nPresident (Information Technology) wishes to update members of the academy with regard to the progress \nmade to date on this important institutional initiative. \nDiscussion: \nDr MacGregor explained that this project represents one element of a larger program and that, while it is in \nthe early stages, there are two current issues at hand.  First, there is a need for the addition of qualified \nGFC Executive Committee 01/12/2015 \nPage 10 \ngraduate administrators; and, secondly, there are current delays in contract negotiations related to \nindemnification and code issues.  He explained that these issues are being addressed. \nA member enquired about the vision behind this project. \n14. Discussion Topics for Meetings of General Faculties Council (GFC) – Proposed (Final) Guidelines \nfrom the Ad Hoc Working Group (of the GFC Executive Committee)  \nMaterials before members are contained in the official meeting file. \nPresenters: Lisa Collins, Member, Ad Hoc Working Group on GFC Discussion (and Member, GFC \nExecutive Committee); Colin More, Member, Ad Hoc Working Group on GFC Discussion (and Member, \nGFC Executive Committee); Fahim Rahman, Member, Ad Hoc Working Group on GFC Discussion (and \nMember, GFC Executive Committee) \nPurpose of the Proposal:  To discuss and agree to proposed guidelines prepared by members of the GFC \nExecutive Committee’s Ad Hoc Working Group for discussion topics to go forward to General Faculties \nCouncil (GFC) in an organized and systematic manner.

She commented that the intended point of the proposed discussion period is to provide \ninsightful and timely discussion on topics of interest and relevance to Council.  She noted that the group \nhad not determined when to discuss the issue again at GFC. \nMembers, during the ensuing discussion, provided a number of comments and questions, including but not \nlimited to:  what the next steps might be; clarification surrounding the introduction of Motions during these \ndiscussion periods; clarification regarding the selection of topics for discussion; whether a vote or general \nconsensus on the proposed guidelines was needed; clarification regarding future steps and timing.   \nMembers agreed, at the conclusion of discussion, that they were satisfied with the revised guidelines, as \npresented, and these should be deployed as the introduction of GFC discussion periods is rolled out.  The \nWorking Group would reconvene one last time to ensure the guidelines were in their final form and \ndetermine an appropriate timeline based on today’s discussion. \n15. GFC Nominating Committee (NC):  Report of the GFC NC as a Recurring GFC Agenda Item \nThere were no documents. \nPresenter: Wendy Rodgers, Chair, GFC Nominating Committee (NC) \nPurpose of the Proposal: To discuss a recommendation of the GFC Nominating Committee (NC) to add to \nthe GFC Agenda information about current vacancies for committee (and other entity) positions to which \nGFC elects members. \nGFC Executive Committee 01/12/2015 \nPage 11 \nDiscussion: \nDr Rodgers, Chair of the GFC NC, stated that members of the Committee were interested in better \nadvertising current vacancies on those bodies to which GFC elects members and that they had \nrecommended adding a recurring item to each GFC Agenda clearly outlining said vacancies. \nMr Bodnar suggested that a link to a central source outlining these vacancies be provided on GFC \nAgendas, thereby ensuring that this information would be current regardless of when a GFC member \nchose to access this data. \nMembers, during the ensuing discussion on this matter, expressed a number of comments and questions, \nincluding, but not limited to:  the effectiveness of such a measure; that the idea behind this is to populate \nGFC Standing Committees in a timely fashion; clarification on who is responsible for keeping this \ninformation updated; clarification regarding the GFC NC’s ability to declare vacancies; whether vacancies \ncan be filled automatically; whether elected GFC members could be expected to serve on at least one GFC \nStanding Committee; commentary that there appears to be considerable redundancy in membership; and \nthat engagement of the wider community in academic governance continues to be an issue. \nMembers agreed that the GFC Agenda would contain a link, associated with the standing item entitled \n“Report of the GFC Nominating Committee,” that would bring members to an always-current list of \noutstanding vacancies and that the Chair of the GFC NC would seek to speak at the next meeting of \nCouncil in order to draw members’ attention to this issue. \n16. Question Period  \nThere were no questions. \nINFORMATION REPORTS \n17. Items Approved by the GFC Executive Committee by E-Mail Ballots  \nThere were no items. \n18.

Decommissioning of the GFC Policy Manual – Update  \nMaterials before members are contained in the official meeting file. \nPresenter: Garry Bodnar, Director of General Faculties Council Services and Secretary to GFC \nPurpose of the Proposal: To provide members of the GFC Executive Committee with an update on the \ndecommissioning of the GFC Policy Manual and the transfer, as appropriate, of GFC-approved academic \npolicies and procedures into the UAPPOL (University of Alberta Policies and Procedures On Line) \nenvironment. \nDiscussion: \nMr Bodnar updated members on the status of efforts towards decommissioning the General Faculties \nPolicy (GFC) Policy Manual, noting that out of 120 sections, there are now only 13 sections remaining and \nof those sections, that several are currently under review and/or in existence in other institutional \ndocuments.  He specifically noted the deletion of Section 5, following the adoption of new staff categories \nin 2011. \n13. Exploring Responsibility Centred Management at the University of Alberta  \nMaterials before members are contained in the official meeting file. \nPresenter(s): Phyllis Clark, Vice-President (Finance and Administration) and Co-Chair, Resource \nManagement Steering Committee; Kerry Mummery, Dean, Faculty of Physical Education and Recreation \nand Co-Chair, Resource Management Steering Committee \nPurpose of the Proposal: To engage members of the GFC Executive Committee in discussion around \nresource management models, including the characteristics of RCM and the potential impacts of adopting \na RCM at the University. \nDiscussion: \nMs Clark and Dr Mummery introduced themselves to members. \nMs Clark reported that the University of Alberta is evaluating the Responsibility Centred Management \n(RCM) model, and the group will provide advice on the model to the incoming President. \nGFC Executive Committee 02/23/2015 \nPage 8 \nMs Clark began her presentation by explaining the differences between the traditional finance model and \nRCM.   She added that RCM is often referred to as incentive-based budgeting. \nDr Mummery provided members with a summary of the intent of RCM, noting that this budget model will \nallow Faculties to manage their own finances, and he added that many other North American post-\nsecondary institutions already utilize this model.  He stated that this item appears on each Deans’ Council \nAgenda so that ongoing discussion and feedback surrounding this issue continue across the academy.  He \nreported that the recent ‘Town Hall’ on RCM was well received and noted that a presentation at GFC on \nRCM could be accommodated. \nMembers, during the discussion surrounding this item, expressed a number of comments and questions, \nincluding, but not limited to:  a suggestion to highlight the future of the Campus Alberta Grant during the \nonset of the presentation; that the Town Hall presentation was excellent; that there is misinformation at the \ninstitution surrounding this matter; clarification regarding how instances of financial unsustainability within \nindividual Faculties would be handled; clarification surrounding the benefits of adopting this budget model; \nwhether this model will involve cross-subsidization; clarification surrounding deferred amortization; whether \nteaching and learning have been incorporated into the RCM discussion; clarification surrounding how \nmembers of the related RCM working groups are selected; clarification regarding how the new budget \nmodel would impact service units. \n14.

Attachment 1 (pages 1 – 4)  A Vision for Innovation in Alberta – Progress Report, Faculty of Graduate \nStudies  \n“A Vision for Innovation in Alberta” \nGovernment of Alberta Grant  \nProgress Report  - January 2016 \nContext of Professional Development \nThe rapid growth in the number of graduate students in the past fifteen years has revealed a disjunction \nbetween academic training and the provincial, national, and global economy our students join on \ngraduation. Only a relatively small number of graduate students and postdoctoral fellows have the \nopportunity to become university professors. While percentages vary by discipline, most sources \nindicate that only about 15% of PhD students will enter the tenure track. The changing nature of \nacademic employment has spurred a global recognition that successful graduate programs must help \ngraduate students and postdocs transition into all sectors of work.  \nWe define Professional Development (PD) as the process by which graduate students and postdocs \nacquire skills that complement their disciplinary knowledge and technical skills. The University of \nAlberta has been ahead of other Canadian universities in this area for many years. We have offered PD \nworkshops and skills development for over a decade now. From 2013-2015 FGSR’s Professional \nDevelopment Advisory Board, a body with representatives from industry, non-profits, government, and \nthe academy, addressed skills and competencies, employer engagement, and university culture \nchange. That body’s work resulted in the Professional Development Strategic Plan, adopted by FGSR \nCouncil in Spring 2015 along with two mandatory program requirements: 1) an Individual Development \nPlan for all graduate students; 2) a dedicated 8-hour PD component that mirrors the ethics module. \nBoth are being piloted this year, with full implementation to take place in September 2016. These \nprogram requirements set the UofA apart from other Canadian and US universities. \nGraduate Students and Postdoctoral Fellows at UofA \nThe University of Alberta has approximately 600 postdoctoral fellows, 3000 PhD and 4600 Master’s \nstudents working in 72 departments across our campuses. Approximately one third of these students \nare international. Unlike some other universities in Canada, the Faculty of Graduate Studies at the UofA \ndoes not have responsibility for postdocs; however, all of our Professional Development opportunities \nare open to postdocs as well as students. \nGovernment of Alberta Grant \nOn March 10, 2015 the University received funding of $2,150,000 per year for three years to pilot PD \ninitiatives. The funding invests in four areas: \n1. Internships ($1,300,000) \n2. Professional Skills Development ($350,000) \n3. Entrepreneurship and Mentorship ($425,000) \n4. Curricular Change ($75,000). \nhttps://uofa.ualberta.ca/graduate-studies/about/resources-for-faculty-and-staff/uofa-professional-development-plan\n“A Vision for Innovation in Alberta” - Progress Report  І  page 2 \nThis report details our progress to date in all of these areas. It is important to note that we have \napproached each of these commitments in the spirit of partnership. We know that we will only be \nsuccessful if we collaborate with employers, alumni, other Alberta universities, student and postdoc \nassociations, and established entities like Mitacs and TEC Edmonton. The FGSR is grateful for the \ngenerous participation of all its PD partners. \nGovernance Model and Commitments \nThis diagram represents the grant commitments and our key partners. We envisage reconstituting the \nProfessional Development Advisory Board with representatives from industry, non-profits, government, \nalumni, students, postdocs and professors. This Board will meet approximately quarterly and offer \nadvice on the overall direction of the PD initiative. \nAt the centre of the diagram sits the key “doer”: the Project Manager, Andrea Graham. She sits on the \nFGSR Dean’s Executive Committee along with the FGSR Associate Deans, the Assistant Dean, the \nOutreach Manager, the SFO and the Dean. This group provides oversight of key academic matters and \nis more hands-on than the Advisory Board. \n“A Vision for Innovation in Alberta” - Progress Report  І  page 3 \nProgress on Specific Initiatives  \nInternships: We tackled internships first because it was clear that this was the area of greatest interest \nfrom students and potential employers. It is also the area of greatest investment from the Government \nof Alberta, and the area of greatest complexity. (Considerable time has been spent aligning the terms of \nthe GoA grant with UofA finance, HR policies, and the GSA Collective Agreement.) \nThe Graduate Student Internship Advisor, who works for FGSR on this grant but is located in the \nCareer Centre, has been finalizing existing partnerships and developing new ones. The goal is a \ndiverse range of work experience opportunities which will allow graduate students to develop hands-on \nexperience outside of academia and through which they can better understand how transferable their \nunique skills really are. By January 2016, three external placements will have begun with IPAC, \nCampus Alberta Neuroscience, and the Alberta Urban Municipalities Association, with the possibility for \nthree to five more to start early spring with their partnering agencies. Another four to five placements \nwill be posted by 1 Feb 2016 within various Government of Alberta departments and partnering \ncommunity agencies. Building on existing partnerships and internship structures will allow us to create \n20 placements per year with IMPORTTEN and up to 50 per year with MITACs. \nInternal placements have been posted for the Faculty of Engineering and the Office of the President, \nwith additional placements planned with the Office of Safe Disclosure and Human Rights, Employment \nEquity, Student Ombud Service, and Community Service Learning. \nProfessional Skills Development: This is an area in which the UofA shines. Because of the efforts of \nDr Renee Polziehn, we have been offering PD workshops to nearly 2000 participants per year for a \ndecade. In addition to these in-person offerings, we have both piloted and purchased online modules \nfor our students’ use: UofA is now the only non-Ontario university with access to MyGradSkills, an \nintegrated PD site developed by a consortium of Ontario universities, and we have streamlined the \nSkillSoft modules available through HRS, too. \nGiven our strength in this area already, our Skills Development emphasis for the government grant \nfocuses on developing collaborative opportunities for grad skills across the Campus Alberta Research \nIntensive universities (UofA, UofC, Lethbridge and Athabasca). We have developed a three-phase \nCampus Alberta Professional Development Initiative that will supplement institutional programs and \ndevelop new inter-university modules that reach across the CARI sector.  \n• Phase 1: Develop matrix, tools, gap inventory, template for e-portfolios, identify metrics, and \nengage graduate students, postdocs and industry representatives (Jan-July 2016) \n• Phase 2: Annual Career Development Conference for graduate students and postdocs (Aug \n2016) \n• Phase 3: Web Portal (2016-17). \nThis Professional Development Initiative will be competitively distinct from programs offered in other \nprovinces. It is designed to be flexible yet coordinated, offering cross-institutional access to students \nand postdocs across Campus Alberta. Its training modules will be offered through a combination of \nonline, in-person and blended delivery mechanisms that offer metrics related to program learning \nobjectives and outcomes. \nEntrepreneurship and Mentorship: The UofA is fortunate to exist in an environment where \nentrepreneurship has already taken shape through some key bodies, and where a rich environment of \nalumni and partners in industry, non-profits and government stand ready to engage with our students \n“A Vision for Innovation in Alberta” - Progress Report  І  page 4 \nand postdocs. Nowhere are we more reliant on our partners than in the area of entrepreneurship and \nmentorship. \nAlberta Venture Mentoring Services has developed a plan for expanding its entrepreneur-focused, \ngroup mentorship model to serve the majority of our graduate students and postdocs. VMS will engage \nthree constituencies in a tiered program: \n• Group 1 (several hundred): Graduate Students (GS)/Postdoctoral Fellows (PDFs) who are \ninterested in learning more about entrepreneurship and whether it is right for them; GS/PDFs \nwho want to hear from alumni who have pursued interesting career paths; GS/PDFs who might \nhave a business idea or technology at a very early stage of ideation. \n• Group 2 (several dozen): GS/PDFs who have a business idea or technology that is past ideation \nstage, who are seeking commercial possibilities or require external assessment of the visibility \nof their idea/technology; GS/PDFs who need specific advice on topics relation to personal \ndevelopment as an entrepreneur. \n• Group 3 (12-20 per year): GS/PDFs who are well into the process of commercializing their \nproduct/technology; GS/PDFs who self-identify as entrepreneurs; GS/PDFs who require \nsupport, feedback and coaching as it relates to running and growing a business.  \nVMS currently offers support to students at the Group 3 level only, so funding from the PD grant will \nallow us to build out offerings to students at the Group 1 and 2 levels.  \nWe continue to develop partnership possibilities with TEC Edmonton, eHUB and UofA’s alumni \norganizations. \nCurricular Change: In some respects, curricular change is the most important and the most complex \narea of endeavour, because disciplinary curricula are so closely enmeshed with academic culture. As \nwe note in the Professional Development Strategic Plan, the University community has to address \nsome tacit but false assumptions, such as:   \n• graduate students and postdocs will pick up all the non-disciplinary skills necessary for success \nin the job market through passive learning;  \n• any career other than that of a tenured university professor is non-traditional, and so unusual in \nsome way;   \n• non-disciplinary skills are only relevant to non-professorial careers;  \n• no graduate student or postdoc can find the time for professional development without either \njeopardizing their academic work or adding significantly to the completion time of their degree. \nTo change the curriculum is to change the culture, and this is a process that must unfold slowly, with \nample consultation. Curricular changes might affect coursework (particularly in the PhD), the form of \nand intended audience for the dissertation, supervisory committees (should non-academic mentors be \nadmitted, e.g.?), the status of full-time vs part-time study, disciplinarity, the status of teaching skills, and \ntime to completion. Graduate degrees have always varied widely, which means that change is likely to \ntake the form of a series of experiments, the outcomes of which may not be known in advance. Buy-in \nwill certainly only come from the ground up. We are working with Dr Sarah Stein Greenberg from the \nStanford d.School on a “design thinking” approach to doctoral curriculum, as a first step. \nItem No. 7 \nGENERAL FACULTIES COUNCIL \nFor the Meeting of January 25, 2016 \nOUTLINE OF ISSUE \nAgenda Title: Annual Report on Undergraduate Enrolment 2015/16 \nMotion:  N/A  \nItem   \nAction Requested Approval Recommendation  Discussion/Advice Information \nProposed by Lisa Collins, Vice-Provost and University Registrar \nPresenters Steven Dew, Provost and Vice-President (Academic); Lisa Collins, Vice-\nProvost and University Registrar \nSubject Discussion of the annual report on undergraduate enrolment  \nDetails \nResponsibility Provost and Vice-President (Academic) \nThe Purpose of the Proposal is \n(please be specific) \nTo discuss the 2015/16 annual report on undergraduate enrolment. \nThe Impact of the Proposal is Provides the institution with undergraduate enrolment information for \nawareness and to aid in future planning.  \nReplaces/Revises (e.g., \npolicies, resolutions) \nN/A \nTimeline/Implementation Date N/A  \nEstimated Cost N/A \nSources of Funding N/A \nNotes N/A \nAlignment/Compliance \nAlignment with Guiding \nDocuments \nDare to Discover Values: to provide an intellectually superior educational \nenvironment; integrity, fairness, and principles of ethical conduct built on \nthe foundation of academic freedom, open inquiry, and the pursuit of \ntruth. \nCompliance with Legislation, \nPolicy and/or Procedure \nRelevant to the Proposal \n(please quote legislation and \ninclude identifying section \nnumbers) \n1.

Success in undergraduate enrolment depends on the university’s ability to meet its \napproved enrolment targets in the face of significant student demand for most undergraduate programs.  \nSuccess also means attracting top students and providing access to a diverse student body (including \nunderserved populations) from across Alberta, Canada, and the world. Finally, success must include \nretaining those students through to completion of their programs and transition to alumni status.  \nThe environment in which the university recruits and admits its students has become increasingly \ncompetitive, given demographic changes that include a reduction in the number of 18-year-olds across the \ncountry, a trend that is expected to continue across Canada for another 10 years. In this environment, well-\nqualified Albertan students are sought after by other top Canadian universities recruiting actively within our \nprovince. Due to the strength of Alberta’s K-12 education system, our high school graduates are often \ngranted specific advantages in admissions processes at universities in British Columbia and Ontario as they \nwork to entice them.  \nAlbertan students also have a wide range of choices among institutions within their home province, as do \ntheir out-of-province counterparts in their own provinces. International markets are tighter than in previous \nyears, with many destination countries increasing active recruitment and some traditional source countries \n(like China) taking deliberate steps to make studying in one’s home country more appealing than ever. With \nso many options available to our prospective students, the University of Alberta must put its best foot \nforward to raise awareness, cultivate positive perceptions, and highlight the range and quality of academic \nprograms available at this university. \nThis year we are able to see the impact of the university’s “10 Point Enrolment Management Plan,” that \nincluded a deliberate shift away from highly conditional early admission offers and toward firm admission \noffers based on the earliest reliable grade information. High school applicants may now receive a firm offer \nof admission (in all programs except Engineering) based on strong Grade 11 marks. Applicants also have a \nchance to demonstrate competitive admissibility throughout their Grade 12 year, right up until their final \nGrade 12 marks are released. Because these offers are most often firm (as opposed to requiring strict \nmaintenance of a prescribed grade average), we saw a significant drop in offer revocation in most faculties.  \nIn the same way that the University of Alberta makes firm commitments to its admitted students, we now \nask for the same in return.  In 2015/16, the university began asking admitted students to formally accept \ntheir admission offers by a specified deadline.  These changes provide additional certainty for students as \nwell as provide better data to faculties managing incoming student enrolment numbers and central service \nunits preparing for the incoming class. \nAnnual Report on Undergraduate Enrolment 2015/16 2 \nThe overall enrolment picture for the 2015/16 cycle is one of steady state. While some faculties seek to \nrecruit additional qualified students, many are managing total enrolment downward in a controlled fashion to \ncorrect previous over subscription to their programs. The university expects to finish the 2015/16 academic \nyear enrolled very close to its total undergraduate enrolment targets. Where demand is high, entrance \naverages will inevitably climb, and this has been the experience at the University of Alberta over the past \ndecade. Still, there are so many learner pathways for Albertan students to choose from, including post-\nsecondary transfer routes to the University of Alberta, so we are aware of our need for increased \nrecruitment to continue attracting strong applicants. \nWhere appropriate, this report includes multi-year trend data. For the first time, we are now able to include \n10-year trends in some categories to support broader discussions that look back as well as forward. \nThe University of Alberta continues to attract a large proportion of our domestic students from within \nAlberta, but many of our students also come from British Columbia, Ontario and Saskatchewan. \nAdditionally, we enrol some students from Manitoba as well as the other provinces and territories. The past \ntwo years represented a small increase in out-of-province enrolment, relative to the years prior.  \nOur international undergraduate student ratio of 14 per cent (stable in 2014/15 and 2015/16) is approaching \nthe institutional undergraduate target of 15 per cent. This is the result of sustained effort across the \nuniversity to attract international students from around the world. “Maple Leaf” students, or study-permit \nstudents already in Canada, have a powerful impact on our international applicant pool – about a quarter of \nthe international students on campus today are in this group.  \nAboriginal students remain a priority enrolment group. This year the university experienced a small increase \nin undergraduate Aboriginal students. Numbers are based on self-identification by students at the time of \nadmission. While there remains much work to be done to achieve a representative Aboriginal population in \nour student numbers, we are pleased to see modest growth and continue to actively recruit Aboriginal \nstudents. In 2015/16, the admission rate for Aboriginal applicants was 63 per cent, which is higher than the \n59 per cent admission rate overall.   \nFirst year undergraduate retention rate remains strong at 87.6 per cent of our domestic first year students \nand 84.1 per cent of our international students returning for their second year of study. Overall first year \nretention rate among domestic and international students is 86.9 per cent, an increase of 0.7 per cent over \nthe previous year sustaining the long term upward trend over the past seven years.   \nThis report is, by nature, retrospective.  Its annual publication and related discussion are intended as \nassessment tools to gauge how well the University of Alberta is succeeding in monitoring and managing its \nundergraduate enrolment. Looking forward, the university can continue to plan and manage on a solid \nfoundation. I’ll look forward to reporting again next year to share news of the 2016/17 cycle, one that is \nalready very active at time of writing. \nYour feedback and questions are welcome; please contact me at ualberta.registrar@ualberta.ca \nSincerely, \nLisa M.

TOTAL UNDERGRADUATE ENROLMENT  \n1.1 ENROLMENT HEADCOUNT \nTotal undergraduate enrolment has been persistently above 30,000 students over the past several years. \nUndergraduate headcount in the 2015/16 academic year is 30,626, a two per cent decrease over \n2014/15 enrolment.  \nThere has been a purposeful correction of over enrolment from previous years in at least five faculties. The \nuniversity has moved from being overenrolled by an average of 2.5 per cent across all faculties in 2014/15 \nto undergraduate enrolment in 2015/16 being much closer to targets in most faculties (an average of 0.3 per \ncent over target across faculties).  \nFigure 1: Enrolment Headcount (2011 to 2015)   \nSource: Office of the Registrar, December 1 REGSTATS Archive \nNote: Undergraduate headcount includes Postgraduate Medical and Dental Education \n 7,474   7,598   7,664   7,572   7,204  \n 31,300   31,904   31,648   31,161   30,626  \n -\n 5,000\n 10,000\n 15,000\n 20,000\n 25,000\n 30,000\n 35,000\n2011/12 2012/13 2013/14 2014/15 2015/16\nGraduate Undergraduate\nAnnual Report on Undergraduate Enrolment 2015/16 4 \n1.2 NEW AND CONTINUING REGISTRATION, UNDERGRADUATE HEADCOUNT  \nTotal undergraduate registration is comprised of “new-to-program” intake (applicants registered) and \ncontinuing students (continuing registered). The percentages of new students in total enrolment vary from \nfaculty to faculty, for example 62 per cent in the Faculty of Native Studies and 42 per cent in the Faculty of \nArts. In aggregate, new-to-program intake constitutes 42 per cent of overall 2015/16 enrolment with the \nremainder 58 per cent constituted by continuing students.    \nAggregate applicant registration declined by three per cent (405) relative to 2014/15. Aggregate continuing \nregistration declined by two per cent (428) relative to 2014/15 despite indications over the summer months \nthat continuing registration was higher than expected. The decline in total registration headcount is largely \ndue to the correction of 2014/15 over enrolment in most faculties.  \nTable 1: 2015/2016 Applicant and Registration Numbers    \nProgram Faculty  Applicants \nApplicants \nAdmitted \nApplicants \nRegistered \nContinuing \nEligible \nContinuing \nRegistered \nTotal \nRegistered \nAgric., Life & Environ Sci. 1,212 787 493 1,168 1,038 1,528 \nArts 5,666 4,008 2,374 3,938 3,362 5,712 \nAugustana Faculty 1,056 675 343 825 678 1,016 \nBusiness 1,101 766 712 1,355 1,311 2,018 \nEducation 2,287 1,599 1,205 1,735 1,544 2,758 \nEngineering 5,259 2,867 1,927 2,489 2,425 4,337 \nLaw 1,240 221 212 343 340 549 \nMedicine and Dentistry 1,912 327 322 720 717 1,041 \nFaculty of Native Studies 153 120 93 93 61 151 \nNursing 1,736 603 466 1,053 1,022 1,486 \nOpen Studies 1,322 1,255 868 1,254 218 1,054 \nPhysical Educ. & Recreation 804 483 373 361 305 938 \nPharmacy & Pharm.

Based on \nFull Load Equivalents (FLE), 2015/16 undergraduate enrolment to target varies across faculties. The \nFaculty of Science has the greatest under-enrolment (estimated 161 FLEs under target), while the Faculty \nof Nursing has the largest over enrolment (estimated 85 FLEs over target). In the 2014/2015 academic \nyear, faculties were on average 37 FLEs over target. Over-enrolment improved in 2015/16 and on average, \nfaculties are 6 FLEs from target. There is still room to optimize some faculty specific enrolments relative to \ninstitutional targets.   \nTable 2: 2015/2016 Enrolment by FLE and Comparison with Targets     \nProgram Faculty \n2015/16 FLE \nEstimates \n2015/16 FLE \nTarget \n2015/2016 \nOver/ Under \nEnrolment \nFLE \n2014/2015 \nOver /Under \nEnrolment  \nFLE \n2015/16 \nOver / \nUnder  % \n2014/15 \nOver / \nUnder % \nAgric., Life & Environ Sc. 1233 1227 6 45 0.5% 3.7% \nArts 4803 4871 -68 -32 -1.4% -0.7% \nAugustana Faculty 903 899 4 58 0.5% 6.5% \nBusiness 1787 1786 1 2 0.1% 0.1% \nEducation 2542 2551 -9 -74 -0.3% -2.9% \nEngineering 4129 4180 -51 199 -1.2% 5.0% \nLaw 549 525 24 1 4.6% 0.2% \nMedicine and Dentistry 1075 1045 30 29 2.9% 2.8% \nFaculty of Native Studies 114 130 -16 -8 -12.5% -6.2% \nNursing 1469 1384 85 160 6.1% 11.4% \nOpen Studies 557 543 14 27 2.6% 5.0% \nPhysical Educ. & Recreation 821 800 21 49 2.6% 6.1% \nPharmacy & Pharm.

Over the past ten years, admission rate has remained in the range of 57 per cent \nto 63 per cent with an average of 60 per cent.

There are multiple factors in yield rate; \nthe observed decline in yield rate over the past six years is due in part to increases in admission averages. \nAs the university has become more selective (targeting highly qualified applicants), this has meant a shift to \na more competitive applicant category. As highly qualified applicants often have multiple admission offers \nfrom other institutions, the number of admitted applicants who register at the university decreases.  \nFigure 6: Ten Year Undergraduate Yield Rate Curve \nSource: Strategic Analysis and Data Warehousing, Applicant and Enrolment Management Report, Enrolment Management Table  \nNotes:  \n1.

However, there were 403 fewer direct entry registrations, indicating a \nlower yield rate among the admitted than in the preceding years.  \nDirect entry yield rates (registrants as per cent of admits) stood at 66 per cent in 2011/12 and 56 per cent in \n2014/15.

Highly qualified applicants are more likely to \nreceive multiple offers of admission from other universities. Therefore, as the University of Alberta \nincreasingly targets highly qualified applicants, it is in competition with the world’s best universities to attract \nthese students.  \nFigure 7: Direct Entry Applicant, Admission and Registration Numbers (2011 – 2015)   \nSource: Strategic Analysis and Data Warehousing, Applicant and Enrolment Management Report. \n 11,721  \n 13,071  \n 14,566  \n 15,109   14,946  \n 7,636  \n 8,161   8,633   8,560  \n 9,116  \n 5,024   5,331   5,111   4,821   4,418  \n -\n 2,000\n 4,000\n 6,000\n 8,000\n 10,000\n 12,000\n 14,000\n 16,000\n2011/12 2012/13 2013/14 2014/15 2015/16\nApplicants Applicants Admitted Applicants Registered\nAnnual Report on Undergraduate Enrolment 2015/16 14 \n2.7 APPLICANT YIELD, UNDERGRADUATE POST SECONDARY TRANSFER \nPost secondary transfer applicant and admission trends are very similar to those for direct entry students. \nApplicant numbers declined by 239 persons in 2015/16 compared with the 2014/15 enrolment cycle, but \n116 more offers were made in 2015/16 than in 2014/15.  \nPost-secondary transfer yield numbers (that is the numbers registered) showed a moderate increase in \n2015/16 compared to 2014/15, but remained lower than in 2011/12 and 2012/13.    \nYield rates among post secondary applicants have been relatively higher and more stable than those for \ndirect entry applicants. Nearly three quarters of admitted post secondary transfer applicants consistently \nchoose to register at the University of Alberta.  Post secondary yield rates increased moderately from 73 per \ncent in 2014/15 to 74 per cent in 2015/16.   \nFigure 8: Post Secondary Transfer Applicant, Admission and Registration Numbers (2011 – 2015)   \nSource: Strategic Analysis and Data Warehousing, Applicant and Enrolment Management Report. \nNote:  Data in the above chart does NOT include Internal Transfer applicants.  \n 8,404   8,607   8,750  \n 8,846   8,607  \n 4,114   4,057   3,810   3,681   3,797  \n 3,137   3,097   2,792   2,701   2,808  \n -\n 1,000\n 2,000\n 3,000\n 4,000\n 5,000\n 6,000\n 7,000\n 8,000\n 9,000\n 10,000\n2011/12 2012/13 2013/14 2014/15 2015/16\nApplicants Applicants Admitted Applicants Registered\nAnnual Report on Undergraduate Enrolment 2015/16 15 \n2.8 ADMISSION TIMING AND YIELD RATE, UNDERGRADUATE DIRECT ENTRY \nYield rate, the proportion of admitted applicants who register, is affected by a number of factors, including \nthe need for timely admission offers, the extension of incentives to highly qualified applicants, the ability of \nadmitted international applicants to obtain immigration documentation, as well as the overall attractiveness \nof the university. The University of Alberta is in competition with other institutions. \nAmong 2015/16 domestic applicants, earlier offers yielded at a higher rate than later offers, but the \ndifference in yield rate was not statistically significant. Among international applicants, no statistical \ndifference was detected in the yield rate between earlier and later offers. That said, it is fully acknowledged \nthat earlier offers are a priority. Offer completion is dependent on a number of factors including submission \nof all required documentations, quality of applicants, as well as RO admission and faculty processing \ntimelines. \nFigure 9: Yield Rate by Month of Admission among High School Applicants (2015/16 Admission Cycle)   \nSource: Office of the Registrar.  \nAnnual Report on Undergraduate Enrolment 2015/16 16 \n2.9 ADMISSION AVERAGES AND YIELD RATE, UNDERGRADUATE DIRECT ENTRY  \nIn the 2015/16 enrolment cycle, the effect of admission averages appeared to be one of the strongest \nfactors on yield rate. Although this preliminary analysis is not yet conclusive due to having only one year of \ndata, it may be early indication of a trend.  \nFor instance, among domestic direct entry applicants admitted into their first choice faculties in December, \nadmission averages explained 93 per cent of the variation in yield rate between admission average bands \nas shown below. Among those admitted in April, admission averages explained 87 per cent of the variation. \nLikewise, among international applicants admitted into their first choice faculties in December, admission \naverages explained 74 per cent of the variation in yield rate between admission average bands. Among \nthose admitted in April, admission averages explained 46 per cent of the variation.   \nAlthough the specific effect of admission averages on yield rate was found to vary from faculty to faculty and \nfrom month to month, the general trend observed in 2015/16 suggested a strong inverse relationship \nbetween admission averages and yield.  \nFigure 10: Yield Rate by Admission Average Band among High School Applicants (2015/16 Admission Cycle)   \nSource: Office of the Registrar.  \nAnnual Report on Undergraduate Enrolment 2015/16 17 \n2.10   ADMISSION REVOCATION RATES, UNDERGRADUATE DIRECT ENTRY \nUp to and including 2014/15, applicants were offered early conditional admission but were also required to \nmaintain a competitive average in order to retain the offer. As a result, offer revocation rates were as high \nas 15 per cent in some faculties, and had been even higher in previous years. Students with revoked offers \nreported high levels of distress.  \nFor 2015/16, all faculties except Engineering made a policy change that allowed extension of firm offers of \nadmission by meeting a competitive average based on either Grade 11 marks, a combination of Grade 11 \nand Grade 12, or Final Grade 12 marks. As expected the revocation rate has fallen dramatically to three \npercent, resulting in increased predictability for students.  \nThe relatively high offer revocation rate for the Faculty of Engineering is reflective of its continued use of the \nprevious conditional admissions policy.   \nFigure 11: Admission Revocation Rates in 2015/16 Compared with the Previous Academic Year   \nSource: Office of the Registrar.  \nAnnual Report on Undergraduate Enrolment 2015/16 18 \n3. INTERNATIONAL UNDERGRADUATE ENROLMENT \nAs faculties manage downwards to enrolment targets, the admissions environment becomes more \ncompetitive for both domestic and international applicants. The current steady state of our international \nstudent population is a positive reflection of the university’s strong reputation and recruitment efforts both \nwithin and outside Canada. \n3.1 INTERNATIONAL ENROLMENT HEADCOUNT, UNDERGRADUATE \nThe university aims to reach an international undergraduate enrolment of 15 per cent. International \nenrolment increased steadily from 9.4 per cent in 2011/12 to 14 per cent in 2014/15. While no further gain in \ninternational enrolment proportion was made in 2015/16, the 14 per cent achieved in the previous year was \nsustained.  \nFigure 12: International Enrolment Headcounts and Proportions in Total Enrolment (2011 to 2015)   \nSource: Office of the Registrar, December 1 REGSTATS Archive \nNotes: \n1.

Therefore country of \ncitizenship does not correspond directly with the last school location of international students.  \nThe following shows the last school country of international students before they enrolled at the University \nof Alberta. The majority of international students come from schools in China. In 2015/16, the proportion of \ninternational students with last school location in China is 57 per cent. Canada is the second most \nfrequently encountered last school country for international students, constituting 23 per cent in both  \n2014/15 and 2015/16. The proportion with last schools in India has persisted at two per cent over the past \nfive academic cycles. Each of Malaysia, Brazil, Saudi Arabia, Japan, the United States and the Republic of \nKorea contributed approximately one per cent to the last school countries of international students in \n2015/16. All other countries contributed approximately 13 per cent to the list of last school countries of \ninternational students in 2015/16.  \nFigure 14: Distribution of International Students by Last School Location (2011 to 2015)  \nSource: Office of the Registrar, December 1 REGSTATS Archive \n0%\n10%\n20%\n30%\n40%\n50%\n60%\n70%\n80%\n90%\n100%\n2011/12 2012/13 2013/14 2014/15 2015/16\n45% 49% \n52% 53% 57% \n25% \n25% 24% 23% \n23% \n2% 2% \n2% 2% \n2% \n17% 16% 14% 14% 13% \nAcademic Year  \nOther\nUnited States\nKorea\nJapan\nSaudi Arabia\nBrazil\nMalaysia\nIndia\nCanada\nChina\nAnnual Report on Undergraduate Enrolment 2015/16 21 \n3.4 INTERNATIONAL DIVERSITY, UNDERGRADUATE ENROLMENT  \nThe aggregate number of countries represented by international citizenship can be an indicator of diversity \nin the international student population.  \nBased on country of citizenship at the time of application to the University of Alberta, 110 countries \n(including Canada) had at least a single student among the undergraduate student population in 2011/12. \nThe number of countries with citizenship (represented by at least a single student) increased to 112 in \n2013/14, but declined to 109 in 2014/15 and 103 in 2015/16.  \nAlthough at least 103 countries are presently represented in the 2015/16 undergraduate student citizenship, \nthe extents of representation differ across countries, as already measured in section 3.2. Only 48 countries \nhave more than five students in the 2015/16 undergraduate population while only 18 have more than 20 \nstudents.  \nIn 2014/15, each of Canada, China, India, Brazil and the Republic of Korea had more than 100 students in \nthe undergraduate population. However, only Canada and China have more than 100 undergraduate \nstudents in the 2015/16 population.  \nAs the university does not collect data on multiple citizenship, students holding dual or multiple citizenship \nthat may increase our diversity do not have their second country of citizenship reflected in this report. \nFigure 15: Number of Country Citizenship in Student Headcount (2011 to 2015)  \nSource: Office of the Registrar, December 1 REGSTATS Archive \n3 3 4 5 2 \n15 16 17 18 \n18 \n39 \n43 42 \n47 48 \n110 110 \n112 \n109 \n103 \n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\n120\n2011/12 2012/13 2013/14 2014/15 2015/16\nN\nu\nm\nb\ner\n o\nf \nC\no\nu\nn\ntr\nie\ns \nAcademic Year \nHeadcount > 100 Headcount > 20 Headcount > 5 Headcount > 0\nAnnual Report on Undergraduate Enrolment 2015/16 22 \n4.

However as a \ngreater proportion (17 per cent) of enrolment came from outside of Canada in 2014/15 and 2015/16 than in \nthe years prior, current within-Canada contribution of 83 per cent is a decrease from the 88, 87, and 85 per \ncent recorded in 2011/12, 2012/13, and 2013/14 respectively.      \nFigure 17: Distribution of Undergraduate Students by Permanent Home Address at Time of Application (2011 to 2015)   \nSource: Office of the Registrar, December 1 REGSTATS Archive \nNotes: \n1.

RETENTION AND COMPLETION RATES \n5.1. STUDENT RETENTION, YEAR 1 TO YEAR 2, UNDERGRADUATE \nRetention rates among first year undergraduates indicate the proportion of first year registered students \nwho return to the university for their second year of study. Students returning for a second year of study \neither return to their first year faculty or transfer to a different faculty.  \nThe proportion of first year undergraduate students who transfer to a different faculty has varied between \n12.7 and 14.5 per cent over the past 8 years. The proportion of first year students returning to their first year \nfaculty increased gradually over the past four academic cycles from 70.3 per cent in 2012/13 to 73.9 per \ncent in 2015/16.  \nTotal retention rate is comprised of those who return to their first year faculty and those who transfer to a \ndifferent faculty. There has been a gradual increase in first year undergraduate retention rate over the \nyears, from 82.2 per cent in 2008/09 to 85 per cent in 2011/12 and 86.2 per cent in 2014/15. In the 2015/16 \nacademic year, 86.9 per cent of the first year cohort of 2014/15 undergraduates returned.   \nThe gradual increase in first year retention rate over the years means a gradual decrease in the proportion \nof first year cohorts who do not return. Of the 13.1 per cent that did not return in 2015/16, nearly half (42 per \ncent) had been required to withdraw. The remainder of the non-returnees dropped out for reasons other \nthan requirement to withdraw.  \nFigure 21: Proportions of First Year Undergraduates who Returned for their Second Year of Study (2007 to 2015)   \nSource: Strategic Analysis and Data Warehousing, Applicant and Enrolment Management Report, Retention Rates Table.  \n70.4% \n67.9% 70.1% 70.0% 70.5% 70.3% \n72.2% 73.2% 73.9% \n13.4% 14.3% 14.0% 14.4% 14.5% 14.4% 12.7% 13.0% 13.0% \n83.8% 82.2% 84.1% \n84.4% 85.0% 84.7% 84.9% \n86.2% 86.9% \n0.0%\n10.0%\n20.0%\n30.0%\n40.0%\n50.0%\n60.0%\n70.0%\n80.0%\n90.0%\n100.0%\n2007/08 2008/09 2009/10 2010/11 2011/12 2012/13 2013/14 2014/15 2015/16\nR\net\nu\nrn\ned\nReport Year \nReturned to Same Faculty Returned to a Different Faculty Total Retention Rate\nAnnual Report on Undergraduate Enrolment 2015/16 28 \n5.2. STUDENT RETENTION, YEAR 1 TO YEAR 2, DOMESTIC UNDERGRADUATE   \nTotal retention rate among first year domestic undergraduates is very similar to the overall first year \nundergraduate retention rate discussed in section 5.1. Between 83.1 and 86.4 per cent of first year \ndomestic undergraduates have historically returned for their second year of study and there has been a \ngradual increase in the retention rate over the years. In 2015/16, retention rate among the domestic cohort \nincreased further to reach 87.6 per cent.  \nHowever, compared to the overall group the rate of faculty change among domestic returnees is slightly \nlower meaning that a slightly higher proportion of domestic returnees return to their first year faculty. In \n2015/16, 75.3 per cent of the previous year’s cohort of first year domestic undergraduates returned to their \nfirst year faculty and 12.3 per cent returned to a different faculty.  \nFigure 22: Proportions of First Year Domestic Undergraduates who Returned for their Second Year of Study (2007 to 2015)   \nSource: Strategic Analysis and Data Warehousing, Applicant and Enrolment Management Report, Retention Rates Table.  \n71.2% 69.4% 71.3% 70.3% 71.1% \n71.2% 72.8% \n74.2% 75.3% \n12.8% 13.7% 13.3% 14.3% 13.8% 13.4% 11.7% 12.2% 12.3% \n84.0% 83.1% 84.6% 84.6% 84.9% 84.6% 84.5% \n86.4% \n87.6% \n0.0%\n10.0%\n20.0%\n30.0%\n40.0%\n50.0%\n60.0%\n70.0%\n80.0%\n90.0%\n100.0%\n2007/08 2008/09 2009/10 2010/11 2011/12 2012/13 2013/14 2014/15 2015/16\nR\net\nu\nrn\ned\nReport Year \nReturned to Same Faculty Returned to a Different Faculty Total Retention Rate\nAnnual Report on Undergraduate Enrolment 2015/16 29 \n5.3.

During the transition, a final report was noted as a \nnecessary summary of what effects were seen: Attachment 1 is that \nreport. \nThe Impact of the Proposal is See ‘Purpose’. \nReplaces/Revises (eg, policies, \nresolutions) \nN/A \nTimeline/Implementation Date N/A \nEstimated Cost N/A \nSources of Funding N/A \nNotes This report was discussed by the GFC Committee on the Learning \nEnvironment (CLE). Some committee members expressed concern \nabout a reduction in response rate after transitioning from the paper to \nelectronic format.  The committee noted that the data reported was \nlimited to a short time frame and that further data would be required to \nassess the long term impact to response rates. Another concern \ndiscussed involved the challenges in using the USRI (whether electronic \nor on paper) for multiple purposes. \nDuring discussion at the GFC Executive Committee, it was noted that \nsystem problems in large classes could occur if the eUSRI is being \ncompleted during class time.  The committee further discussed how the \nimportance of the USRI could be communicated to students, and \nwhether sufficient response time was given to students in light of the \nchanges in withdrawal dates. \nAlignment/Compliance \nAlignment with Guiding \nDocuments \nDare to Discover, Dare to Deliver  \nCompliance with Legislation, \nPolicy and/or Procedure \nRelevant to the Proposal \n(please quote legislation and \ninclude identifying section \nnumbers) \n1.

Lab sections not previously surveyed were surveyed \nelectronically, but overall lab sections saw the greatest decrease in response. Lecture sections see milder \nresponse rate decreases. Comparisons of scores and response rates broken out for section type, faculty, \nand department follow in tabular format. The data in this report is a snapshot of one term for paper \n(Winter 2014) and one term for electronic (Winter 2015). \nIn Fall 2013, a pilot project was undertaken to offer Universal Student Ratings of Instruction (USRI) online \nfor face-to-face classes. The pilot project included 49% of the instructor-sections for the Fall 2013 term. \nSections in the pilot were approved to participate by the appropriate Dean or department Chair.  \n A summary of findings1 was presented in January 2014 including an analysis of response rate levels and \nmedia differences between online vs. paper-and-pencil operation. Research literature reports that scores \nobtained from online questionnaires are comparable to those from paper-and-pencil questionnaires while \nresponse rates are appreciably lower. The report concluded that the research literature findings also held \nat the University of Alberta. \nSubsequent to the GFC approval of modifications to GFC 111.3 (GFC 22 SEP 2014), IST implemented \nthe USRIs online administration campus-wide. Workshops and one-on-one training sessions were \nprovided to departmental contacts having responsibility for ordering the questionnaires. Some important \nchanges to note: \n- The window of administration for the online questionnaires is normally from the day after the \nwithdrawal deadline until the last day of classes (7 to 9 days). \n- A communication campaign focused on students was introduced using websites, Twitter, \nUniversity of Alberta Facebook channels, and screens in public places around campus. \n- USRI questionnaires were administered for courses with 4 to 9 students, using only open-ended \nquestions. \nDuring the academic year 2014/15 the USRI questionnaires were delivered online. The operation \nincluded: \n- Announcements to instructors (a week before the evaluation started) \n- Announcements to students (the day the USRI questionnaires open) \n- Reminders to instructors  \n- Reminders to students  \nThis report explores the response rate distribution and compares the results from paper-and-pencil with \nonline USRI delivery. Table 1 includes the number of instructor-sections for each term and delivery \nmethod. \nTable 1: Instructor-sections by Term and delivery method \nTerm USRI’s Delivery Instructor-sections \nFall 2013 Paper-and-Pencil 2114 \nOnline (Pilot Project) 2030 \nWinter 2014 Paper-and-Pencil 3860 \nFall 2014 Online 4618 \nWinter 2015 Online 4040 \n1 http://www.vpit.ualberta.ca/eusri/pdf/eUSRIFall2013Study.pdf \n 2 \nThe analysis compares the winter term of 2014 when USRIs were completed using paper-and-pencil to \nthe winter term of 2015 when the USRIs and the process were fully online. \nWinter 2014 \nIn January 2014, the directive from the Provost’s office was to conduct the USRI questionnaires using \npaper-and-pencil format. There were a total of 342 requisitions submitted for paper administration \nincluding 3860 instructor-sections. (Note there are instructor-sections for a single class where team-\nteaching is involved). \nCourses delivered over the Web with an online USRI questionnaire were excluded from the study. \nWinter 2015 \nAs established with changes to the GFC policy 111.3, the USRI questionnaires were conducted online. \nThe USRIs were available from the day after the withdrawal deadline until the last day of classes (April 2 \nto April 10 which included Easter break). Enrollment was updated daily during the administration window \nto exclude student withdrawals as soon as they were processed by the registrar office. \nFor Winter 2015, there were a total of 511 requisitions submitted for online administration, including 4040 \ninstructor-sections. The increase in the number of requisitions is due to additional lab-sections being \nevaluated and the administration of the USRI for courses with 4 to 9 students (open-ended questions \nonly) using the online system. \nCourses that required a paper-and-pencil USRI questionnaire (i.e. Field studies with no internet access) \nwere excluded from the study. \nIn the following tables, the main questionnaire items of interest that were explored were: \n1. Overall, the quality of the course content was excellent. \n2. Overall, this instructor was excellent. \nOverall comparisons of results from paper surveys versus online surveys are shown below in Tables 2-4. \nAll the following tables show the percentile distributions of response rates and median scores where \nthe 50th percentile indicates an average value and the 5th and 95th percentiles are given to show the \ntypical range of values. Values appreciably below the 5th percentile could be considered anomalies \nneeding individual investigation or explanation. \nTable 2: Overall Response Rates \nTerm \nN \nMin Max \nPercentiles \nValid Missing 5 25 50 75 95 \nWinter 2014 3860 0 3.3 100.0 35.5 64.3 78.0 90.0 100.0 \nWinter 2015 4040 0 6.3 100.0 30.8 50.6 62.1 76.2 95.0 \n 3 \nTable 3: Medians for Item: “Overall, this instructor was excellent” \nTerm \nN \nMin Max \nPercentiles \nValid Missing 5 25 50 75 95 \nWinter 2014 3860 0 1.8 5.0 3.4 4.1 4.6 4.8 5.0 \nWinter 2015 4040 0 1.0 5.0 3.2 4.1 4.5 4.8 4.9 \nTable 4: Medians for Item: “Overall, the quality of the course content was excellent” \nTerm \nN \nMin Max \nPercentiles \nValid Missing 5 25 50 75 95 \nWinter 2014 3247 0 1.5 5.0 3.3 4.0 4.3 4.6 4.9 \nWinter 2015 3240 0 1.0 5.0 3.1 3.9 4.2 4.6 4.9 \nWhile there was a 15% drop in response rates for online compared to paper surveys in this term \n(Table 2), the median scores for the items of interest were very similar (Tables 3,4).

The office provided advice to 156 individual students, staff and faculty \nduring the reporting year.  \nThe office also participated in university-wide activities such as: \n● Duty to Accommodate Working Group;  \n● Employment Equity Advisory Committee; \n● Duty to Accommodate Working Group; \n● Sustainability Awareness Week; \n● Equity, Diversity and Inclusion Week; \n● Supervisor Leadership Program; \n● New Employee Orientation & Info Marketplace; and \n● Week of Welcome (North and Augustana Campuses). \nOSDHR and HIAR Annual Report 2014-15 \nNovember 23, 2015   Page 4 of 12      \nTRAINING \nThe OSDHR Advisor delivered 31 training sessions to staff, students and faculty at North, Enterprise Square, Campus St. \nJean and Augustana Campuses.  Training was delivered at opportunities such as New Employee Orientation, Gold \nLeadership College, Augustana New Student Day, Residence Services Base Camp, the Supervisory Leadership Program \nand the Centre for Teaching and Learning’s Inclusive Learning Environments series (in partnership with the Student \nSuccess Centre). \nThe sessions were primarily focused on matters of human rights; however, disclosure services are also highlighted.  A \nseminar was hosted to promote the Public Interest Disclosure Act and inform participants of the university’s processes \nin relation to the Act. \nOSDHR translated some materials for use as Campus St Jean. \nCOLLABORATION \nThe OSDHR Advisor is called upon to collaborate with other post-secondary institutions as well as other organizations in \nAlberta and across Canada.  For the reporting year, these activities included: \n• Keynote address on “Human Rights in the Post-Secondary Context” at Medicine Hat College’s Human Rights \nDay activities; \n• Past President, Canadian Association for the Prevention of Discrimination and Harassment in Higher Education; \n• Chair and Emcee for the John Humphrey Centre Human Rights Awards; \n• Member of the Advisory Council of the Canadian Centre for Diversity and Inclusion, including involvement in \nthe develop of its professional designation; \n• Presentation on duty to accommodate at the Alberta Adapted Physical Activity Conference, Red Deer, Alberta; \n• Delivery of “Human Rights and Inclusion” workshop to a department within the Government of Alberta; and \n• Policy development in the area of accommodation and inclusion for the Fringe Theatre Festival Board of \nDirectors. \nWEB AND SOCIAL MEDIA \nOSDHR content within the disclosure domain (www.disclosure.ualberta.ca) had 4,767 unique page views.  The OSDHR \nhas an active Twitter account that is primarily used to promote human rights and disclosure matters that pertain to the \nUniversity. The account had 1,291 followers as of the end of the reporting year. \nREVIEW OF FUNCTION \nIn 2008, the University of Alberta’s Office of Human Rights was disbanded in favour of a new model to deliver \nhuman rights and safe disclosure services to the campus community. The Office of Safe Disclosure and Human Rights \n(OSDHR) was established and some services previously delivered by the Office of Human Rights were transferred to \nother units on campus, primarily Human Resources Services.  In 2015, WMC was contracted by the Vice-President \n(Finance & Administration) to evaluate the effectiveness of the new model, and to determine ways in which its \nperformance might be enhanced or changed.  A summary of the results is included in this report at Appendix B. \nOSDHR and HIAR Annual Report 2014-15 \nNovember 23, 2015   Page 5 of 12      \nUPCOMING PRIORITIES \nEDUCATION AND AWARENESS \nThe Office will continue to design and implement tools that assist in education and awareness activities. This includes \ndeveloping an online reporting and self-serve tools as well as continuing to embed disclosure and human rights \nprinciples into existing resources. The online reporting tool will be implemented in November 2015 to augment current \nOSDHR disclosure mechanisms.\nHUMAN RIGHTS VISITING LECTURESHIP \nIn partnership with Global Education, OSDHR will focus on reinvigorating the Visiting Lectureship in Human Rights. \nThis will include a review of the endowment’s terms of reference and an implementation plan for future events. \nASSESSMENT AND IMPLEMENTATION OF RECOMMENDATIONS FROM OSDHR REVIEW \nRecommendations contained in the OSDHR review will be evaluated. An implementation plan that outlines priorities, \ntimelines and required resources will be developed to address the recommendations.  \nOSDHR and HIAR Annual Report 2014-15 \nNovember 23, 2015   Page 6 of 12      \nGoals: \nto encourage the campus community to “Trust Your Instincts,” to recognize \nand report worrisome behaviours of those at risk of harm to self or others  \nto provide a confidential centralized location for reports of worrisome \nbehaviour and to connect situations that would otherwise seem to be \nisolated incidents, and assess the reported behaviours  \nto help connect Individuals at Risk to resources before a situation escalates \nREPORTS OF INDIVIDUALS AT RISK \nNUMBER OF INDIVIDUALS REPORTED \nThe HIAR Case Team Coordinator received 421 reports about 280 perceived Individuals at Risk, an increase from the \nprevious year in both the number of reports (16%) and the reported number of perceived Individuals at Risk (23%). \nThese numbers demonstrate a continued growth in the program. \nThe majority of reports about perceived Individuals at Risk were regarding undergraduate students (66%); 16% were \ngraduate students, 5% were faculty or staff, 4% were in open studies, 5% were about former students and the \nremainder (4%) were other (i.e. applicants, visiting or special students, or former employees). The majority of \nperceived Individuals at Risk were male (59%).   \nInternational Students comprised 28% of all perceived Individuals at Risk (staff and students), and 34% of students \nreported to the program; only a marginal increase from the previous reporting year (1%).  \nMost reports about perceived Individuals at Risk were about either a risk of harm to self (41%) or an exhibition of \nbehavioural concerns (41%) which did not meet the assessment of harm.  16% of the perceived Individuals at Risk \nwere reported to be at risk of harm to others, 1% were at risk of both harm to self and others and there was one \nreport about a disruption to the community. \n0\n100\n200\n300\n400\n500\nNumber of\nIndividuals at Risk\nNumber of Reports\n2010-11\n2011-12\n2012-13\n2013-14\n2014-15\nStatus of the Individual at Risk \nUndergraduate\nGraduate\nFaculty and Staff\nFormer Students\nOpen Studies\nOther\nOSDHR and HIAR Annual Report 2014-15 \nNovember 23, 2015   Page 7 of 12      \nThe number of reports about those exhibiting behavioural concerns - that is displaying those worrisome behaviours \nthat could not yet be defined as a clear risk of harm to self or others - was again significant this year. Reporters seem \nto recognize that although the behaviours are not yet a clear risk of harm to self or others, they would rather make a \nreport and have HIAR intervene earlier, or at least create a record of the behaviours, in case they escalate in the \nfuture. \nREPORTERS OF AT RISK BEHAVIOUR \nThe greatest number of reports came from University of Alberta Protective Services (128 reports or 30%), Residence \nServices (66 reports or 16%) and the Faculty of Arts (46 reports or 11%).  The Office of the Dean of \nStudents/University Student Services made 35 reports (8%) and the Faculty of Science made 26 reports (6%). \nThe great majority of reports came from staff members (319 reports or 76%), with 9% coming from senior \nadministration, 10% from instructors, 4% from students, and 3% from family members. \nThe busiest months \nfor receiving reports \nof At Risk Behaviour \nwere November \n2014, December \n2014, and April 2015.  \nThere continues to be \nno significant trends \nappearing for \nreporting peaks other \nthan the summer \nmonths having fewer \nreports. \nType of At Risk Behaviour \nHarm to Self\nBehavioural Concern\nHarm to Others\nHarm to Both\nDisruption to Community\nReporters of At Risk Behaviour \nProtective Services\nResidence Services\nFaculty of Arts\nOffice of the Dean of Students\nFaculty of Science\nOther Areas of Campus\n0\n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\n60\nJuly Aug Sept Oct Nov Dec Jan Feb Mar Apr May June\n2012-13\n2013-14\n2014-15\nOSDHR and HIAR Annual Report 2014-15 \nNovember 23, 2015   Page 8 of 12      \nSERVICES PROVIDED \nThe HIAR Coordinator often provides more than one service to a perceived Individual at Risk or to the reporter, \ndepending on the situation and the level of risk of the individual.  Outside of receiving a report for information \npurposes under the centralized reporting component of the HIAR policy (61%), the most common services provided \nwere to follow up with a situation (39%), provide referrals for the Individual at Risk (32%) and refer the case to the \nHelping Individuals at Risk Case Team (21%).   \nAll cases that involved concerns of harm to others were referred to the Helping Individuals at Risk Case Team for \nassessment. \nService Provided Number of Times % of Individuals at Risk \n2014-15 2013-14 2014-15 2013-14 \nInformation Purposes Only 172 142 61% 65% \nMonitor Situation 17 107 6%* 50% \nReferral for Individual at Risk 89 58 32% 27% \nReferred to HIAR Case Team 60 49 21% 23% \nFollow Up Required 110 37 39%* 17% \nContact Individual at Risk 42 34 15% 16% \nReporter/Victim Provided Referral 31 27 11% 13% \nCoaching/Advice for Reporter 45 22 16% 10% \nAssess Risk of Individual at Risk 14 16 5% 7% \nDiscuss Safety Measures 14 13 5% 6% \nRefer to or Attend Protocol Team 5 9 2% 4% \nProvide information on HIAR 2 8 1% 4% \n*The significant change in these numbers from the last reporting period to this one are due to a difference in \ndocumentation rather than a difference in service provision. The HIAR Case Team Coordinator created the more \nactive category of follow up to better capture the types of activities that were occurring (contacting the faculty or \nservice providers, gathering more information from the reporter, etc.). \nEDUCATION ACTIVITIES \nThe HIAR Case Team Coordinator made a concerted effort to create awareness of the program across campus \nincluding presentations to as many faculty and department council meetings as possible.  The education activities \nincluded: \n- Conducting 19 presentations about the program to the general campus community \n- Presenting to 11 Faculty and 15 Department Council meetings on North campus, Augustana and Campus St. \nJean \n- Participating in the Sexual Misconduct Review, Suicide Prevention Strategy Task Force and Violence \nPrevention Working Group \n- Translating HIAR program material to French for Campus St Jean. \nThe HIAR web pages were accessed by 744 unique visitors, a 10% increase over last year. The web page had 50 visits \non the day of the student death in HUB mall. \nOSDHR and HIAR Annual Report 2014-15 \nNovember 23, 2015   Page 9 of 12      \nPROCESS DEVELOPMENT \nHIAR continues to promote procedures to formalize threat assessments for emerging cases in collaboration with \nUniversity of Alberta Protective Services.  This included hosting a second Violence Risk Triage workshop and a \nComprehensive Violence Risk Assessment workshop for key stakeholders on campus.  \nHIAR was prepared for a formal review of the program as outlined in the HIAR policy which was to be led by the Office \nof the Dean of Students.  The focus of the Dean of Students has been to expand the program to consider academic \n“early alert” warning signs and therefore, the review of the current program was deferred. PwC had conducted a \nreview of components of the program in 2013 and recommendations to strengthen process documentation were \nimplemented. \nUPCOMING PRIORITIES \nINFORMATION SHARING PROTOCOLS \nThe HIAR Case Team Coordinator will establish a written protocol for information sharing between HIAR and Protocol \n91, HIAR and University of Alberta Protective Services and HIAR and Counselling and Clinical Services as recommended \nafter the review of the student deaths on campus last year. \nEDUCATION, AWARENESS AND INTAKE \nHIAR, coupled with the Office of Safe Disclosure and Human Rights, is continuing to implement a communication plan \nto enhance education and awareness of the HIAR program, including online videos regarding the HIAR program, and \nthe development of an online reporting tool.   \nIn response to the increasing number of reports to HIAR, a (0.5 FTE) Helping Individuals at Risk coordinator was put in \nplace for September 2015 to support the program’s intake. \nIntake and program awareness will remain the main focus of the HIAR staff for the upcoming year. \nOSDHR and HIAR Annual Report 2014-15 \nNovember 23, 2015   Page 10 of 12      \nAPPENDIX  – SUMMARY OF THE REVIEW OF SAFE DISCLOSURE AND HUMAN RIGHTS SERVICES  \nINTRODUCTION \nIn 2008, the University of Alberta’s Office of Human Rights was disbanded in favour of a new model to deliver \nhuman rights and safe disclosure services to the campus community. The Office of Safe Disclosure and Human \nRights (OSDHR) was established with a mandate to develop and implement a more neutral and decentralized \nmodel of service delivery. Some services previously delivered by the Office of Human Rights were transferred to \nother units on campus, primarily Human Resources Services. \nWith the introduction of the new office, services of the previous Office of Human Rights were distributed to: \n The OSDHR: mandated to offer intake and referral services for concerns regarding conduct that does not meet \nthe University’s ethical standards, including concerns relating to human rights.  It was also mandated to \npromote a culture to ensure human rights principles are integrated into daily campus life. \n Human Resource Services: assumed the roles of employment equity, mediation of staff disputes and learning \nand development related to human rights issues. \nThe intent was to create a distinction between intake and advice for disclosure and human rights issues, and the \ncase management of individual issues which may be more appropriately dealt with through existing dispute \nresolution and specialized investigative/review services. \nAs per part of the agreement made at the time of the implementation of the new model (to perform a review of its \neffectiveness after it had been operational for five years), WMC was contracted to evaluate the effectiveness of the \nnew model, and to determine ways in which its performance might be enhanced or changed. The following is a \nsummary of their final report.  This summary is verbatim from the report.  Sections that identified participants in the \nreport, repeated information, or consisted of background information were not included in this summary. \nMaterial for this analysis was gathered from a number of sources including an extensive interview program, a \nreview of relevant documentation, detailed comparator research and an assessment of performance of the \ndecentralized services previously part of the Office of Human Right’s mandate. \nHAS THE CHANGE BEEN SUCCESSFUL? \nWhen the new Office of Safe Disclosure and Human Rights was launched in 2009, and some functions moved to \nHuman Resource Services, the stated purpose for the change was documented and reported to the University \ncommunity. WMC’s assessment of performance against these criteria is examined in the report. \nStated Purpose for Change Assessment \n  Adapt to the expanded role of human rights, \nequity and safe disclosure needs on campus. \nSome changes or adaptations needed. \nProvide further efficiencies in service and \nFunctioning well in current structure. \nEnsure a more consolidated monitoring \nand reporting of complaints. \nSome changes or adaptations needed. \nOSDHR and HIAR Annual Report 2014-15 \nNovember 23, 2015   Page 11 of 12      \nStated Purpose for Change Assessment \nEnsure timely development of the \nUniversity’s Discrimination and Harassment \nPolicy and reasonable Accommodation \nFunctioning well in current structure. \nEnsure a greater integration of these services \ninto the HR and Student Services fabric. \nFunctioning well in current structure. \nAt the time of the change, a letter from concerned students was received that documented five concerns students had \nwith the change to the former Office of Human Rights. WMC’s assessment of the OSDHR’s performance against these \ncriteria is examined in the following table. \nStudent Concern Assessment \n  Lack of proper interim procedures Not applicable to this review. \nLoss of OHR functions Office has alleviated concern. \nLowered visibility and profile of human rights \nand equity on campus \nOffice has alleviated concern. \nLoss of important advocate for students Not part of Office’s mandate and should \nnot be pursued. \nLack of consultation and transparency Not applicable. \nCONCLUSION \nThe OSDHR and the University’s new model for service provision have been a successful initiative to improve \nawareness, build partnerships and provide a safer environment for students, staff and faculty at the University of \nAlberta. The office functions well with limited resources and a complex and interconnected stakeholder web. \nSome risks to ongoing sustainability and future growth have been identified, and it will be important to ensure that \nthe Office continues to evolve and expand to meet these challenges. To maximize the benefits and reach of the \nOffice, the following recommendations have been developed to assist in the continued provision of excellent \nservice, in meeting the requirements outlined in its mandate, and model the principles that drove its creation. \nRECOMMENDATIONS \nIt is recommended: \n1) That the current structure of the OSDHR, its triage model of service delivery and reporting \nrelationship to the Board of Governors, be maintained. \n2) That means be found to more publicly demonstrate the University’s Senior Administration’s support for the \nwork of the OSDHR. \n3) That an Advisory Committee be considered, where appropriate to provide guidance regarding systemic issues \nand opportunities within the University of Alberta, as well as review trends in the broader community. The \nAdvisory Committee could be established as a subcommittee or task force of a current Committee (such as \nthe Equity Committee). If established, this committee needs a closely defined mandate as well as a ‘sunset \nclause’ to be invoked when the committee has met its mandate. \n4) That more robust performance measures be developed that track the ‘value’ of outcomes, as well as the \nvolume of work.  This will be a challenge for the Office, given the competing challenge of maintaining \nOSDHR and HIAR Annual Report 2014-15 \nNovember 23, 2015   Page 12 of 12      \nconfidentiality while also tracking outcomes in a decentralized case management environment. \n5) That greater attention is paid to monitor the intake volume in the OSDHR of the three key stakeholder \ngroups of student, staff and faculty; and that efforts be made to adjust the focus of outreach services as \ndeemed necessary. \n6) That the budget cuts to the mediation budget [in Human Resource Services] be re-evaluated to \nensure that people are not deterred from accessing the service by cost considerations, and that it is \nwidely available to employees. \n7) The roles and responsibilities, and methods of support for learning and development outreach should \nbe clarified between OSDHR and Human Resources Services. \n8) That additional resources be dedicated to the OSDHR, to address long-term sustainability, support \neducation and communications programming and focus on systemic issues facing the campus community. \n9) That the Outreach and Education programs be expanded through the use of students and other \nvolunteers. \n10) That dedicated resources are allocated to focus on specific and distinct responsibilities: one to address \nsystemic issues across the campus community; and a separate resource tasked with intake, case \nmanagement and tracking of case resolution. \n11) That guidelines for formal working relationships with referral groups be established with set \nmethods of follow up and tracking among groups. \n12) That the OSDHR continue to monitor and review the policies and procedures to ensure they are relevant and \nmeeting the needs of the University community and report findings to the Office of the Vice-President \n(Finance and Administration). \nOVERALL RESPONSE \nOSDHR agrees with most of the recommendations put forward by WMC and will look for ways to enhance to areas \nnoted.  In 2015-16 the office will: \n- ensure senior administrative support for the program is demonstrable, though we highlight that support has \nbeen longstanding; \n- develop an approach to ensure an effective advisory committee is introduced for the Human Rights \npriorities.  It is intended that the approach will align with requirements and expectations being developed \nthrough the new institutional planning process; \n- explore integration of outcomes measures with other groups. Communications will be enhanced and \nguidelines for formal working relationships with referral groups will be established; and \n- introduce a student volunteer framework to address staffing concerns. \n  GENERAL FACULTIES COUNCIL \nOPEN SESSION  \nMeeting of January 25, 2016 \nITEM 4 - New Members of GFC \nMOTION I: TO APPOINT/RE-APPOINT  [This motion may be proposed only by statutory members of \nGFC – VPs, Deans, statutory students or elected faculty members]:  \nThe following non-academic staff member elected by the Non-Academic Staff Association (NASA) for a \nterm concurrent with her term of appointment on the Board of Governors (December 15, 2015 to \nDecember 14, 2018):  \nFaiza Billo Human Resource Services \nThe following non-academic staff representative nominated by the Non-Academic Staff Association \n(NASA) for a term beginning immediately and ending June 30, 2018:  \nWei Liu University of Alberta International \nMOTION II: TO RECEIVE [This motion may be proposed by any member of GFC]: \nThe following ex officio member, to serve on GFC for a term beginning January 1, 2016 and extending for \nthe duration of his appointment (January 1, 2016 to June 30, 2016): \nJohn Beamish Acting Dean, Faculty of Science \nR:\\GO05 General Faculties Council - Committees\\GEN\\15-16\\JA-25\\New Members\\Item-4-Listing-of-Names-Jan25.docx \nItem No. 12 \nGENERAL FACULTIES COUNCIL \nFor the Meeting of January 25, 2016 \nGeneral Faculty Council Standing Committee Report \nExecutive Committee  \n1.
