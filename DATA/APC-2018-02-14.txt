The committee then discussed the cost of materials for MEC E 161 and how fees are communicated to students.",

She indicated that the SU is concerned that tuition increases are not predictable. Mr Soltannia presented the Graduate Students' Association (GSA) stance on the proposed increase to international tuition. He noted that the GSA does not support an increase greater than CPI and feels that the proposed tuition increase places unpredictable and undue hardship on current international graduate students who play a large role in the University community. Dr Dew responded that the 3.14% increase is based on increased costs. He noted that the Campus Alberta Grant does not fund international students, and that international students must demonstrate that they have adequate resources to obtain a study permit. He further indicated that that there are emergency bursaries and emergency loans available to international students who face financial struggles. Members agreed that international students add to the quality and diversity of the overall educational experience for all students. Members discussed: sources of funding and help for students who are facing financial strain; the importance of predictability of tuition and fees for students; the impact to the budget and to the student experience; and how the proposed tuition increase was calculated. Ms Banister and Mr Soltannia asked that their opposition to the motion be recorded.",

It is administered by the PTJC and run by \nRitsumeikan University. The course ran for three years until 2015, since then it was suspended due to \ncurriculum reviews and fee issues. Due to the limited availability of funding, PTJC is no longer able to \ncover the students’ fees that are necessary for the operation of this course.  \nAs there are very few short-term courses offered in Japan, our centre receives a number of inquiries \nfrom students regarding the availability of this course. At the same time, hosting these courses at \nRitsumeikan University, one of the universities that have a university-wide MOU with the University of \nAlberta, offers opportunities for collaborative academic networking for both students and faculty \nmembers from our university.  \nThese short-term courses are designed to give students, who may have never studied outside Canada \nor cannot study abroad for a long period, optimal learning opportunities to experience foreign culture and \nstudy Japan in one of the safest and culturally dynamic settings.   \nPut N/A in any boxes that do not apply \nProposer \nFaculty/Department  Arts / PTJC \nDean/Chair Lesley Cormack / Aya Fujiwara \nPrimary Contact (Name, phone \nnumber, and e-mail) \nAya Fujiwara (492.1569, fujiwara@ualberta.ca) \nSecondary Contact (Name, \nphone number, and e-mail) \nOliver Rossier (492.5247, orossier@ualberta.ca) \nItem \nPurpose of Fee (what it is to be \nused for) \nRitsumeikan University service fees, including medical facilities on \ncampus, human resources for information sessions and consultations. \nProposed Amount $970 (without optional fees) – $1520 (with optional fees) per student. \nPrevious Fee Amount (if this is \na new fee, please indicate that \nNew fee (Previously funded from the PTJC, but that is no longer \nfinancially sustainable.

The joint program \nbetween our institutions is virtually unique as far as I know, and it offers both their students and ours an \ninteresting and useful way to combine studies at our two universities. We need more such programs of \nstudy so that Canadian studies can gain a deep understanding of Japanese culture and history and a high \nlevel of language proficiency in Japanese. The program has obvious benefits to students from Japan, but \nwhat also must be kept in mind is that Japanese students who come and reside on our campus for a \nsemester, or a year or two, are an asset to our students and our intellectual community here. \n The University of Alberta and Ritsumeikan University enjoy long and extensive relations. \nStudents from our university have been studying at Ritsumeikan for more than a generation. \nRitsumeikan is an outstanding institution in Japan. The lovely, urban, campus is perfectly located a \nstone’s throw from some of the most iconic gardens and temples in Kyoto, to which people throughout \nthe world travel all the time to view and enjoy. Ritsumeikan has broad relations with universities \nthroughout North America and Western Europe, and they are well-experienced in hosting foreign \nstudents. They have a strong program in teaching Japanese as a foreign language. They have decades of \nexperience in housing students, both in dormitories and in Japanese home-stays. It is an ideal place to \nsend a student for a study abroad program for a summer, a semester, or a full academic year. \n I sincerely hope we can see our important and fruitful relationship with Ritsumeikan maintained, \nfurther developed, enhanced, and extended. I see it as a valuable asset to our menu of options for \nstudents wishing to study abroad. It is of course a great opportunity for students majoring in East Asian \nStudies. I therefore support this proposal completely and emphatically. \nSincerely, \nChristopher Lupke, Ph. D. \nProfessor and Chair \n10\nTo   whom   it   may   concern, \nI   am   writing   this   letter   in   my   capacity   as   the   Japanese   Studies   Representative   for   the \nEast   Asian   Studies   Undergraduate   Students’   Association   (KGK)   in   support   of   the \ncontinuation   of   the   Ritsumeikan   Summer   Japanese   Program   (RSJP). \nA   summer   program   such   as   the   RSJP   allows   students   to   extend   and   deepen   their \neducation   without   postponing   their   degrees,   which   many   students   must   do   when   they   choose \nto   go   abroad   during   the   fall   or   winter   semesters.   The   summer   program   at   Ritsumeikan   in \nparticular   extends   beyond   language   instruction   to   also   introduce   students   to   various   Japanese \ncultural   practices.   This   allows   students   to   gain   a   deeper   understanding   of   the   context   behind \nthe   Japanese   language,   which   is   difficult   to   gain   if   one   studies   solely   in   a   foreign   language \nclass   context. \nI   have   attached   to   this   letter   testimonials   written   by   a   couple   of   students   who   attended \nthe   RSJP   during   the   summer   of   2016.   I   hope   that   the   program   will   continue   to   be   offered   and \nprovide   students   with   the   valuable   opportunity   to   enrich   their   Japanese   language   and   culture \neducation. \nSincerely, \nDanielle   Warner \nJapanese   Studies   Representative \nEast   Asian   Studies   Undergraduate   Students’   Association \n11\nRitsumeikan   Summer   Japanese   Program   Testimonial \nName:   Lucas   Becker \nAttendance   Date:   May-June   2016 \nFaculty   and   Major:   Faculty   of   Education,   Secondary   Education,   Japanese   Major  \nThe   Ritsumeikan   Summer   Japanese   Program   was   a   life-changing   experience   that   not \nonly   allowed   me   to   grow   as   a   person   in   a   multitude   of   experiences   and   ways,   but   the \nexperience   also   brought   members   from   many   nations   together   in   a   truly   unique   bonding \nexperience.   Ritsumeikan   compliments   this   sense   of   internationalism   by   actively   encouraging \na   global   mindset   in   its   quality   education   in   the   Japanese   Language   and   in   Japanese   Culture   on \na   daily   basis.   RSJP   offered   an   opportunity   for   myself   and   others   to   really   see   what   its   like   to \nbe   plunged   into   an   unfamiliar   situation,   and   with   the   help   of   the   staff   and   students   at \nRitsumeikan,   we   thrived.  \nRitsumeikan   allows   its   RSJP   students   to   come   to   the   ancient   city   of   Kyoto,   and \nexperience   traditional   Japanese   arts,   as   well   as   be   in   complete   immersion   in   both   traditional \nculture   and   the   history   not   accessible   anywhere   else   in   Japan.   From   a   demonstration   from   the \nmain   house   of   traditional   Japanese   tea   ceremony,   close   proximity   to   the   birthplace   of   Zen \nBuddhism,   and   other   Kyoto   specific   events   are   where   the   RSJP   program   differentiates   itself \nfrom   any   other   travel   abroad   program   in   Japan.   The   month   long   program   was   an \nunforgettable   opportunity   I   wish   others   have   for   years   and   years   to   come. \nThank   you,  \nLucas   Becker \n12\nRitsumeikan   Summer   Japanese   Program   Testimonial \nName:   Iyla   So \nAttendance   date:   May-June   2016 \nFaculty   and   Major:   School   of   Public   Health,   Master   of   Public   Health \nJust   over   a   year   ago,   in   May   to   June   of   2016,   I   attended   the   Ritsumeikan   Summer \nJapan   program,   also   known   as   RSJP.   At   the   time,   I   had   just   finished   the   first   year   of   my \nMaster   of   Public   Health   at   the   School   of   Public   Health,   and   although   my   degree   has   little   to \ndo   with   Japanese   culture   or   language,   I   had   a   great   interest   in   it   since   I   had   taken   up   to \nJAPAN   202   in   my   undergraduate.   I   am   very   grateful   that   I   was   able   to   participate   in   this \nprogram   despite   not   being   in   a   Japanese   major   or   minor.   RSJP   was   a   great   refresher   for   my \nJapanese   language   learning,   but   also   so   much   more.   The   program   itself   has   a   great   balance \nbetween   actual   Japanese   language   classes,   culture   activities,   and   free   time,   such   that   the \nstudents   are   always   surrounded   the   Japanese   language   and   culture   and   have   every   opportunity \nto   learn.   I   truly   had   a   wonderful   experience   in   the   beautiful,   traditional   city   of   Kyoto   and \nhave   a   lingering   attachment   to   the   city   and   all   the   friends   I   made   and   activities   I   had   done \nthere.   The   great   thing   about   doing   RSJP   with   the   U   of   A   is   that   I   was   able   to   make   a   number \nof   friends   that   would   help   support   my   Japanese   language   learning   back   at   home,   in   addition \nto   making   Japanese   friends,   and   friends   from   other   countries.   Myself   as   well   as   other   friends \nhave   attended   RSJP   over   the   years   and   we   all   consider   it   an   important   and   treasured \nexperience   in   our   lives.  \n13\nLast updated October 1, 2014 \nRegistrar’s Advisory Committee on Fees (RACF) \nFor the meeting of: May 23, 2017 \nItem No. <03> \nRequest for Approval for: Field trip fee for AUBIO 315 Advanced Biological \nAnalysis \nFee Type (see end of form for definitions)*: \n Mandatory Student Instructional Support Fee \n Alternate Delivery Fee \n Cost Recovery Fee / Revenue Generation \n Other \nOUTLINE OF ISSUE:  Request the implementation of a $0-100 MSIS fee for a required \nfield trip in AUBIO 315.

Student Consultation   \n20\nProposed Mandatory Instructional Support Fee for Internships/Work Placements/Practicums Sourced by UAI \nUAI has been collaboratively working with our constituent Faculties for many years to source international \ninternship/work placements/practicums.  Some of these have been facilitated through existing UAI offerings, like \ne3, which are cost-recovery and help us to cover some of our operating costs by charging participants the e3 \ntuition fee for a WKEXP course (anywhere from $1030 - $1425 based on the location) .  Other programs, like the \nBerlin Initiative Internships, have provided students with assistance in their placement, including ongoing support \nfrom an employee in Berlin, at no additional cost other than the UAI application fee of $250.   \nClearly, there is a need to standardize fees if a student is in a placement that is being sourced by UAI.  Specifically, \nthis applies to placements in locations where UAI employs a local coordinator: Berlin (Germany), Curitiba (Brazil) \nand Washington, DC (USA).   The current situation is not only unfair to participating students, but it is also \nconfusing to explain and administer.  By standardizing fees, UAI can charge students the same rate regardless of \nlocation or program offering.  To address this, UAI is exploring the creation of a Mandatory Instructional Support \nFee.  This fee would cover the administrative costs for all areas of support.  This includes: \n- Conducting an initial interview with the student \n- Resume review \n- Contacting potential internship hosts/sourcing the placements \n- Facilitating interviews \n- Pre-departure preparation for the students (including general country advice and more specific things like \ndifferences in workplace etiquette and expectations \n- Housing assistance \n- Advice and assistance with visas and work permits \n- Risk management monitoring while students are in-country (including any required liaison/updates to the \nOffice of Emergency Management and the Risk Management Team in UAI) \n- Site visits with both the intern and host  \nThe MISF we would like to propose is $500. We are proposing this based on feedback from our local coordinator in \nBerlin who has been involved with the majority of internship placements over the past two years.  She calculated \nthis based on the average of the number of hours spent with each individual intern before and during the \nplacement multiplied by her hourly salary (25.50 Euros).  \nIt is worth noting that UAI has recently changed our internal policies and will not charge the MISF until after a \nstudent has been matched with an appropriate placement.  If UAI is not successful in finding a suitable placement, \nthe student will not be charged.   \nThe proposed fee of $500 is comparable to others currently in place for international placements.  For example, \nthe Classics field schools in Greece and Italy have a variable MISF ranging from $600-$1050.  EDFX 490 \n(International Field Experience in the Faculty of Education) charges a variable fee that ranges anywhere from $0-\n$2000.  We recognize that $500 may not cover all related costs in a given location (due to fluctuating rates of \nexchange, etc.), but it is also important for us to try to keep this affordable since cost is listed as one of the major \nbarriers for any student considering an international opportunity.  Based on feedback from both past participants, \nalso on-campus student consultations, students recognize the amount of support UAI will be providing before and \nduring the placement and feel this is good value for the cost. \n21\nhttps://www.ualberta.ca/why-ualberta/international/go-abroad/programs/e3-programs\nhttps://www.ualberta.ca/why-ualberta/international/go-abroad/~/link.aspx?_id=6113F41F2FCA453CA2527F8E0E189261&_z=z\n1-17 Humanities Centre \nEdmonton, Alberta, Canada T6G 2E5 \nTel: 780.492.4295 \nFax: 780.492.6325 \nwww.arts.ualberta.ca \nUNDERGRADUATE STUDENT SERVICES  \nFACULTY OF ARTS \nNovember 10, 2017 \nTrevor Buckle, Associate Director (Programs) Education Abroad  \nUniversity of Alberta International  \nRE: Proposed Mandatory Instructional Support Fee (MISF) for Internships/Work \nPlacements/Practicums Sourced by UAI  \nDear Trevor,  \nThank you for giving the Faculty of Arts the opportunity to work with you in the development of \nyour proposal for a new MISF for UAI sourced Internships, work placements and practicums.  \nThe Faculty of Arts fully supports this proposal as it stands. It is clear that the comprehensive \nservices that UAI provides to students both before and during work terms will be invaluable in \nhelping them to have a successful, safe and well-supported experience abroad.   \nAlthough the Faculty of Arts recognizes that there will be an additional cost to students, we \nacknowledge the value in the services that UAI plans to provide. It also recognizes UAI’s \nefforts to standardize this cost across its programs and that students will only be charged the \nMISF or application fee if a suitable placement is sourced and the student accepts the \nplacement.  \nWe are thankful to UAI for incorporating our suggestions in the final proposal, and for the \ncareful consideration of the needs of various campus stakeholders. Again, the Faculty of Arts \nfully supports the proposed MISF.  \nPlease let me know if you require any further information. \nYours sincerely,  \nAllen Ball  \nAssociate Dean, Teaching and Learning, Student Programs \ncc: Michael O’Driscoll, Acting Vice Dean, Faculty of Arts \n22\n23\nMSISF Proposal – UAI – Attachment 4: Course Descriptions \nKIN 492 - Professional Practicum \n★ 9 (fi 18) (variable, variable) A half-time unpaid Professional Practicum of 20 hours per week for 14 \nweeks, or the equivalent time.

In total, I have consulted with four \nstudent groups: \n- Dean’s Advisory Council (chaired by the Dean of Students) \n- International Student Advisory Committee \n- Education Abroad Squad International (student volunteers who have taken part in a study abroad \nprogram) \n- Council on Student Affairs \nI should note that on at least two of the committees (DAC and COSA), representatives from both the Students’ \nUnion and the Graduate Students’ Association were present. As expected, the prospect of a new fee for students \nwas greeted with some hesitation, but after discussing the background information the general consensus was \nthat the fee makes sense.  The majority of students appreciated the fact that it would go towards vital support, \nand by being transparent about what the students would receive, they felt that this would give prospective interns \nenough information to decide if they would want to use our services or choose other options (like a Canadian \nplacement). \nIf you have any questions about the specific discussions, I would be happy to elaborate on them. Many thanks for \nyour assistance in reviewing this proposal.  \nSincerely, \nTrevor Buckle \nDate: Wednesday, December 6, 2017 \nTo: Lisa Collins and Angelene Lavers, Office of the Registrar \nFrom: Trevor Buckle, University of Alberta International \nCc:  \nRe: Proposed MISF for International Internship Placements \n27\nLast updated October 1, 2014 \nRegistrar’s Advisory Committee on Fees (RACF) \nFor the meeting of: November 28, 2017 \nItem No. <02> \nRequest for Approval for: MEC E 464 \nFee Type (see end of form for definitions)*: \n Mandatory Student Instructional Support Fee \n Alternate Delivery Fee \n Cost Recovery Fee / Revenue Generation \n Other \nOUTLINE OF ISSUE:  When originally set up, MecE 464 was offered partially off-campus \n(NAIT).  The course was set up with a Mandatory Instructional Support Fee (Lab Fee) of \n$800-1300 which first appeared in the 2010-11 Calendar.  One year later, in the 2011-12 \nCalendar, the course was changed to a Cost Recovery Course with a fee of $1425.  The \nhistorical rational for this second change is unclear. \nMecE 464 most recently offered in Spring/Summer of 2017 after not being offered for a \nnumber of years.  The delivery of the course has changed since its inception.  The NAIT \nfacilities are no longer required as the course is now entirely on-campus with a different \nproject focus.  Given the lack of the NAIT component, the fee of $1425 was deemed \nexcessive, and it was requested to be reduced to $900. \nGiven that the course is now offered entirely on campus, it is no longer appropriate to \noffer on a cost recovery basis and should be reverted back to a standard course with a \nMandatory Instructional Support Fee, estimated to be $400 per student (see attachment \nbudget justification).  \nPut N/A in any boxes that do not apply \nProposer \nFaculty/Department    Department of Mechanical Engineering    \nDean/Chair   John Doucette (Chair)    \nPrimary Contact (Name, phone \nnumber, and e-mail) \n  Don Raboud, don.raboud@ualberta.ca, 780-492-2244    \nSecondary Contact (Name, \nphone number, and e-mail) \n Jason Carey, 780-492-0501,jpcarey@ualberta.ca     \nItem \nPurpose of Fee (what it is to be \nused for) \nThe fee will be to purchase the hardware required for groups of students \nto complete an assigned project.

The \ndetailed estimate (shown below) of $427.50 per student  is based on the expected group composition of \n4 students per group.  Depending on enrollment numbers, a few groups may have 5 students.  The cost \nper student based on 5 students per group would be somewhat lower ($342 / student).  $400 per student \nis a reasonable compromise as most groups are expected to have 4 students.     \nProject details \nMEC E 464 will have a core design project which will run through the course. For this project, the students \nwill be expected to design-build and test a working integrated mechanical system such as a remote control \nbuggy, or a 3D printer, or a Quadcopter. The students will work on the project in groups of 4 (or 5 in some \ncases). Depending upon the project, each group will be given the startup kit at the start of the course. The \nstudents will also have access to 3D printer, laser cutter, and a router for rapid prototyping. This will also \nrequire cost for 3D printing materials and prototyping material.  However, the cost of those consumables \nwill be borne by the Department.  The proposed Mandatory Student Instructional Support Fee of $400  is \nto cover the cost of purchasing the project kit and related materials as detailed below. \nThe example project used for costing purpose is a Quadcopter. The project kit will comprise the \nQuadcopter electrical and mechanical components (as well as raw material needed to carry out the \nproject).  Each group, expected to consist of 4 students, will be assigned a kit of commercial off-the shelf \ncomponents consisting of electronic/mechanical hardware components (along with a time allowance to \naccess the manufacturing services such as 3D printing, laser cutting, water jetting, and 3D scanning). The \ninitial hardware costs for the project are expected to be around $1710 CAD per group (Table 1).  This \ntranslates into $427.50 CAD per person, based on 4 students per group. At the end of the course the \nstudents will be able to keep their design projects. \nTable 1 Expected costs for the Project \nNo. Description Cost per group Per person cost \n1 Quadcopter  UAS frame $388 CAD $97.00 \n2 Quadcopter Motors, ESC, and power electronics $180 CAD $45.00 \n3 Quadcopter Batteries  $260 CAD $65.00 \n4 9 Channel radio receiver $182 CAD $45.50 \n5 9 Channel radio transmitter $500 CAD $125.00 \n4 Safety Net $200 CAD $50.00 \nTotal $1710 CAD $427.50 \n31\nAttachment 2 \nProposals for Changes to Existing Mandatory Student Instructional Support Fees \nCourse Implementation Current Fee Proposed Fee Page \nNumber \nGEOPH 436 September 1, \n2018 \n$200 - $600 $200 - $1400 33 \nMandatory fees assessed in anticipation of costs for supplies, equipment, materials, or services \nwhich are not directly related to the delivery of instruction in a course or program, but are \nconsidered required elements of a course or program.

It is the second largest source \nof unrestricted operating funds and represents approximately 30 percent of total operating revenues. \nIn June 2015, Alberta Advanced Education announced a two-year tuition freeze and the rollback of market \nmodifiers approved in December 2014. In October 2016, Alberta Advanced Education extended this regulated \ntuition freeze by an additional year, and a similar announcement was made in November 2017, extending the \nfreeze to the 2018-19 academic year. The freeze will also continue for market modifiers and mandatory non-\ninstructional fees, but as in prior years, it does not apply to international tuition. We are awaiting details on \npotential grant backfill for domestic tuition. \nThe University of Alberta continues to face significant budget challenges, balancing limited growth in operating \nfunding against rising investment costs for teaching and research. In addition, the university has faced multiple \nyears in which the rate of increase in its operating expenditures has outpaced the rate of increase in its \nunrestricted revenues, creating a structural deficit in the operating fund. \nThe financial challenges facing the university are significant given the budget assumptions of no revenue \ngrowth in its primary sources of operating funding, coupled with ongoing cost pressures. Important steps are \nbeing taken to address these challenges and position the institution on a sound financial footing, including \nbudget reductions of 4.0 per cent that will be implemented for 2018-2019, along with projected budget \nreductions of 2.5 per cent in each of the following two years. Nevertheless, the University of Alberta must \ncontinue to seek and maximize multiple revenue sources in supporting its core mission.  \nTUITION PROPOSAL \nIt is recommended that, effective September 1, 2018: \nAll international tuition fees increase by 3.14 percent, with the exception of the International Graduate \nTuition increase implemented in 2017-18, which will remain unchanged.  \nThis is consistent with the University of Alberta’s principle that revenues should increase at a rate \ncommensurate with actual costs to avoid degradation of quality.  Details of the proposal are outlined below. \nPage 3 of 3 \nInternational Fees: \nNotes: \n(a) Values are based on full-time per term and full-time per year unless otherwise stated. \n(b) Tuition applies to thesis students who were admitted to the program of study prior to Fall 2011 and are \nassessed the reduced thesis rate. \n(c) Tuition applies to thesis students who were admitted to the program of study beginning in Fall 2011 or \nlater; this is based on an annual fee assessment (including spring/summer). \n(d) As approved by the Board of Governors, December 16, 2016. \n(e) Figures may be rounded downwards at fee index level for administrative purposes, thus lowering the \neffective year over year percentage increase below 3.14 percent. \n(f) Per year for full time student, excluding Cost recovery and graduate course based Physical Therapy, \nOccupational Therapy, and Speech master’s programs in Faculty of Rehabilitation Medicine. \n(g) $4000 will be cost-neutral and offset by an equal amount of financial support. \n$ %\nArts and Science $21,009.60 $21,668.40 $658.80 3.14%\nBusiness $27,636.32 $28,503.12 $866.80 3.14%\nEngineering $25,211.52 $26,002.08 $790.56 3.14%\nJuris Doctor (JD) Program $45,573.48 $47,003.48 $1,430.00 3.14%\nPharmacy (BSc (Pharm)) $39,431.68 $40,666.88 $1,235.20 3.13%\nEconomics Course $2,680.62 $2,764.70 $84.08 3.14%\n$ %\nCourse Based Master’s $8,181.36 $8,437.68 $256.32 3.13%\nThesis 919 b $5,104.84 $5,265.08 $160.24 3.14%\nThesis Based Masters /PhD c $7,057.80 $7,279.32 $221.52 3.14%\nMaster’s in Business Administration $16,017.84 $16,519.68 $501.84 3.13%\nIntegrated Petroleum Geosciences Course $2,924.12 $3,015.86 $91.74 3.14%\nInternational Graduate Tuition Increase f, g $4,000.00 $4,000.00  $             -   0.00%\nChange e\nChange e\nUndergraduate a 2017-18 d 2018-10\nGraduate a 2017-18 d 2018-19\n- 1 -\nU15 International Tuition \n2017-18\nInternational\n$ Rank $ $ Rank\nUniversity of Alberta $21,010 8 $7,058 13 $7,058 13\nDalhousie University $16,650 11 $17,085 7 $18,560 3\nMcGill University $17,331 10 $16,373 8 $14,697 8\nMcMaster University $25,905 7 $17,096 6 $17,096 6\nQueen's University $37,490 2 $12,927 9 $12,927 9\nUniversité Laval $16,373 12 $19,501 3 $17,507 5\nUniversity of British Columbia $34,847 3 $8,436 12 $8,436 12\nUniversity of Calgary $18,338 9 $12,696 10 $12,696 10\nUniversity of Manitoba $13,517 14 $10,240 11 $10,240 11\nUniversity of Ottawa $27,343 4 $19,260 4 $16,334 7\nUniversity of Saskatchewan $15,584 13 $5,909 14 $5,909 14\nUniversity of Toronto $45,690 1 $21,560 1 $21,560 1\nUniversity of Waterloo $26,940 5 $19,914 2 $19,716 2\nWestern University $26,614 6 $17,694 5 $17,694 4\nAVERAGE $24,545 $14,696 $14,316\nAVERAGE w/out U of A $24,817 $15,284 $14,875\n Undergrad \n(Arts & Social Science) \nM.

Through the implementation of its strategic plan, the \nuniversity is contributing to the achievement of the government priorities of accessibility, \naffordability, quality, coordination, and accountability. \nThe U of A’s consolidated budget (see Table 1) reflects the entire enterprise, including \nunrestricted and restricted funds. The 2018-19 consolidated budget, developed subject to public \nsector accounting standards, reflects an excess of revenue over expense of $14.4 million on \nbudgeted revenue of $1,958.5 million and budgeted expense of $1,944.1 million. Under \nlegislation, the university is required to present to government, a positive consolidated position. \nConsolidated Revenue \nKey highlights of the university’s 2018-19 revenue assumptions include: \n● 0.0 per cent change to the Campus Alberta grant  \n● Maintaining domestic general tuition and MNIFs at 2014-15 levels (due to government \ntuition and MNIF freeze)  \n● Increasing international student tuition fees at a rate approximating university cost \nincreases at 3.14 per cent \n● No tuition or MNIF backfill funding \n● A decline in federal and other government funding from 2017-18 \n● Modest growth in ancillary operations \n● More cautious projections of short-term investment income within the operating budget \n($17 million) \n● Stable capital funding \n● No Lights on Funding for the Research and Collections Resource Facility \nConsolidated Expense \nKey highlights of the university’s 2018-19 expenditure assumptions include: \n● Academic staff compensation and terms and conditions to be negotiated \n● Support staff salary wage re-opener to be negotiated  \n● Benefit cost increases of 4.0 per cent \n● All faculties and administrative units continue to assume responsibility for the funding of \nnegotiated salary ATB and merit (NASA/AASUA merit average 1.1 per cent) \n● Third party contractual obligations increasing between 0.8 to 5.8 per cent \n● Impact of carbon levy of $1.5 million  \n● Impact of minimum wage increase in contractual obligations of $0.55 million  \n● Accommodating $14.1 million in incremental cost pressures in spending plans \n● 4.0 per cent budget reduction across faculties and administrative units \nOperating Fund \nThe operating fund (see the first column on Table 2) is used to support the primary teaching and \nlearning activities of the university. It is also within the operating fund that strategic investments \nare made to advance For the Public Good and its five strategic goals of Build, Experience, Excel, \nEngage and Sustain. That said, given the revenue picture, any such investments are \nnecessarily limited in 2018-19. For 2018-19, the operating fund reflects an excess of expense \n2 \nover revenue of $2.7 million on budgeted revenue of $1,140 million and budgeted expense of \n$1,142.7 million.   \nThe operating fund for 2018-19 and the following two-year projections have been prepared \nbased on three fundamental assumptions.  First, that there will be no change to the Campus \nAlberta grant over the three-year period. Second, that there will be no increase in regulated \ntuition or Mandatory Non-Instructional Fees (MNIFs) over the planning period. Third, that there \nis no increase in the grant for tuition backfill funding.  Given the provincial government’s current \nfiscal situation, the university believes that it is prudent to take a conservative approach in \nbudgeting its major sources of operating revenue. \nAs reported in previous budget documents, the university has faced multiple years in which the \nrate of increase in its operating expenditures has outpaced the rate of increase in its \nunrestricted revenues, creating a structural deficit in the operating fund. \nAt the same time, the university continues to be faced with annual cost pressures including a \n3.1 per cent increase due to the carbon levy, a 2.7 per cent increase due to minimum wage, \nbenefit cost increases of 4.0 per cent, third party software licences and maintenance contracts \nof 5.8 per cent and facilities and operations contracts of 0.8 per cent (not including minimum \nwage). In addition, the university has made the explicit decision to begin reducing its reliance on \ninvestment income to fund ongoing base expenditures given the significant fluctuations that can \noccur in market returns.   \nWith the assumptions of no increase in the Campus Alberta grant, the ongoing tuition freeze, \nthe impact of cost pressures, the need to eliminate the structural deficit and the desire to reduce \nreliance on short-term investment income, budget reductions of 4.0 per cent will be \nimplemented for 2018-19, along with projected budget reductions of 2.5 per cent in each of the \nfollowing two years. It is important to note that these budget reductions are over-and-above the \nimpact to each Faculty and administrative unit in funding the cost of any negotiated Across the \nBoard (ATB) salary increases and merit. Commencing in 2019-20, each faculty and \nadministrative unit will also be required to fund incremental benefit cost increases. \nThe financial challenges facing the university are significant given the budget assumptions of no \nrevenue growth in its primary sources of operating funding, coupled with ongoing cost pressures. \nImportant steps are being taken to address these challenges and position the university on a \nsound financial footing.  These steps include the introduction of the university’s new budget \napplication, uPlan, the adoption of multi-year accountability plans and budgets, a plan to resolve \nthe structural deficit and the ongoing development of a new budget model.  These strategies \nand others will enable the university to maximize the use of its resources, establish a sound \nfinancial footing, and invest in its strategic plan – For the Public Good.   \n3 \nTable 1 \n2018-19 Consolidated Budget \nBudget\nBudget Forecast 2018-19 2019-20 2020-21\nRevenue\nProvincial government 980,958       1,010,183   1,021,681   992,360       1,005,563   \nFederal and other government 216,832       208,906       190,510       193,677       200,528       \nTuition and related fees 329,954       334,031       341,218       346,952       348,992       \nSales of services and products 206,144       208,820       218,863       226,413       229,994       \nGrants and donations 116,988       131,814       115,244       118,427       122,333       \nInvestment income 68,197         65,500         70,984         73,783         73,092         \n  Total revenue 1,919,071   1,959,255   1,958,499   1,951,612   1,980,502   \nExpense\nSalaries 962,801       964,887       992,918       968,023       971,001       \nEmployee benefits 182,605       186,995       193,909       192,724       205,550       \nMaterials, supplies, and services 311,281       297,860       310,552       308,645       315,045       \nUtilities 54,800         53,364         55,904         57,004         57,971         \nMaintenance 123,490       154,247       92,566         88,730         94,873         \nScholarships and bursaries 89,160         110,201       116,417       121,910       126,540       \nAmortization of capital assets 178,519       177,529       181,878       189,510       191,348       \n  Total expense 1,902,655   1,945,083   1,944,144   1,926,547   1,962,327   \nExcess (Deficiency) 16,416         14,172         14,355         25,066         18,175         \nInvestments in Capital Assets (54,395)       (32,760)       (29,303)       3,010           6,906           \nNet Transfers -

More than 50 per cent of university buildings were built in the post-war \n(1951-1975) or modern (1976-1990) periods; both of which are known for lower standard \nconstruction practices. \nThe University of Alberta’s capital plan is firmly rooted in an acknowledgement that our ability to \nadequately maintain the existing inventory of buildings across five campuses has become \nunsustainable and requires a recommitment to better utilize existing building and land assets. \nWith the government priorities of affordability and quality in mind, the capital plan emphasizes \nrenewing and repurposing building infrastructure supplemented by a tacit understanding that \nstrategic reductions in building inventory will be a necessary means to achieving a more \nmanageable campus environment.  \nDeferred Maintenance \nDeferred maintenance is an area of particular focus as the university’s aggregate liability now \nexceeds $1.0 billion. Work continues to identify and address deferred maintenance through  \nrenewal and repurposing projects to maintain, and optimally improve, the condition and \nfunctionality of the building inventory. The university is grateful for the increase in Budget 2017 \nto the Infrastructure Maintenance Program grant, however, only through access to sustained \nand predictable funding for deferred maintenance in the order of $40-50 million annually, can \nthe liability be reduced in a meaningful way. This amount is still below the industry best practice \nof 2.0-4.0 percent of the current replacement value of supported infrastructure. \nStrategic Investments to Date \nThe University of Alberta has had considerable success in identifying opportunities to leverage \nexisting funding and to explore creative partnerships and project delivery models. This has been \nan inherently delicate endeavour considering our five distinct campuses, each serving unique \nand separate constituencies within Alberta. \nIn Budget 2016, the Government of Canada announced the Post-Secondary Institutions \nStrategic Investment Fund to enhance and modernize research and commercialization facilities. \nWith the support of the Government of Alberta, the University of Alberta was successful in \nreceiving approval for 10 projects as follows: \n SIF PROJECTS - APPROVED \nPROJECT \nGovernment of \nCanada ($) \nGovernment of \nAlberta ($) \nUniversity of \nAlberta ($) \nTotal \n($) \nElectrical & Computer \nEngineering Research Facility 11,000,000 7,000,000 7,000,000 25,000,000 \nChemistry - Lab \nModernization/Renewal 8,485,307 7,040,500 7,266,340 22,792.147 \nRevised February 13, 2018\n2 \nChemical Materials \nEngineering Building 9,886,000 7,000,000 5,114,000 22,000,000 \nBiological Sciences & \nEarth and Atmospheric \nSciences \n9,023,974 5,500,000 7,476,026 22,000,000 \nInnovation/Incubator Space 1,500,000 0 2,000,000 3,500,000 \nResearch Network \nInfrastructure Upgrade 8,405,194 0 8,848,738 17,253,932 \nAugustana - Science Lab \nRenewal 1,093,100 0 2,247,551 3,340,651 \nCampus Saint Jean - Science \nLab Renewal 1,308,540 0 2,298,598 3,607,138 \nClinical Sciences Building 3,092,310 0 4,610,690 7,703,000 \nMedical Sciences Building 2,458,750 0 2,541,250 5,000,000 \nTOTAL 56,253,175 26,540,500 49,403,193 132,196,868 \nAdditionally, three major capital projects are at varying stages of completion. \nDENTISTRY - PHARMACY BUILDING \nProject Description Project Cost Completion \nRenewal and repurpose of this building is allowing the university to \neffectively utilize a significant infrastructure asset. The renewed facility \nwill provide new teaching, academic, and administrative space at the \nheart of North Campus as well as reduce reliance on leased space. This \nproject also addresses major health and safety issues (asbestos, fire \nsafety, and indoor air quality), building code and physical condition \nissues, as well as focuses building outcomes to reduce its carbon \nfootprint. \n$249,000,000 2023 \nEAST CAMPUS VILLAGE 9 \nProject Description Project Cost Completion \nThe residence, which is on target for occupancy in September 2018, \nwill become home to approximately 300 students organized in cohorts \nof four and six bedroom units. \n$35,350,000 2018 \n3 \nLISTER 5 \nProject Description Project Cost Completion \nIncreasing housing inventory for first-year students remains a key \nmeans of making a post-secondary education accessible to Albertans. \nThe newest tower in the ‘Lister Complex’ will become the home of \napproximately 460 first-year students beginning in September 2018. \n$40,500,000 2018 \nTop Capital Priorities \nIn support of the academic and research priorities identified in the Comprehensive Institutional \nPlan, the university has identified its top three capital projects. In addition to these top three, all \nsubstantial projects requiring support anticipated over the next five years have also been \nidentified. Support may be in the form of direct government investment, government support of \nborrowing through the Alberta Capital Finance Authority, and/or philanthropic endeavours. \nIn all cases, projects focus on improved asset utilization by reducing risk, addressing deferred \nmaintenance, reducing the environmental footprint and improving building performance. The \nuniversity also continues to place significant emphasis on repurposing existing infrastructure \nand reducing reliance on leased space. \n 1.   FACULTY OF ARTS - EXPANSION PROGRAM \nProject Description Project Cost Completion \nAs an alternative to a new downtown campus development, a multi-year \nphased renewal and expansion program will address program pressures \nin several buildings including Fine Arts, Industrial Design, HUB, Tory, \nand the School of Business. \n$178,600,000 2022 \n2.  CAMERON LIBRARY - BUILDING ENVELOPE \nProject Description Project Cost Completion \nRenewal of the Cameron Library building envelope is required due to \nfailed panel support systems resulting in panels falling from the walls. \nAdditionally, precast panels are dislodging from the exterior walls, \nrequiring installation of security fencing to protect pedestrians. Finally, \nthermal scans have revealed an overall failure of the building envelope, \nresulting in increased energy usage. \n$24,786,336 2020 \n3.  CHEMISTRY EAST - TEACHING RESEARCH LAB MODERNIZATION AND RENEWAL \nProject Description Project Cost Completion \nThese labs are original to the 1973 building and in very poor condition \nto the degree that present usability is in jeopardy. Continued use of \nthese labs presents risks to the institution (quality of instruction and \n$14,231,000 2021 \n4 \nreputation) and to the environment. Renewal and modernization of 14 \nteaching labs will support teaching and research while also reducing \nenergy consumption, improving environmental sustainability, and \naddress lab safety with upgraded fume hoods. \nEmerging Capital Priorities \nRecognizing the uniqueness of operating five separate and distinct campuses, the remaining \nprojects are presented in order of priority for each campus. \nCapital Projects -
