She noted that this applies mostly to situations where a student moves from a thesis to a course based program. Currently thesis programs have a four year time limit, and course based programs, which are targeted at working professionals, have a six year time limit. The wording presented distinguishes transferring from starting a new program. On the question of a student transferring from an MSc to a PhD, it was noted that this was covered in another section.",

Discussion: Dr Nagel noted that this change would ensure that a student has completed at least two thirds of their term work with GPA 2.0 on this work in order to ensure that the student is in a position to pass. A member suggested that a link be added to the second paragraph rather than quoting a section number which, in the new online calendar, will no longer exist. The Committee discussed the rationale for the 2.0 GPA and it was noted that this level is required to give the student the possibility of passing.",

            "Description": "Purpose of the Proposal: The Certificate in Interdisciplinary Leadership Studies will provide students with formal recognition of the leadership skills they have acquired through their coursework and through their experiences at the PLLC. The certificate will indicate to employers and graduate schools that the students have taken courses, have participated in co-curricular programs, and have had stretch experiences through which they have developed the ability to tackle the challenges of leadership in all aspects of their lives. It will be available to students in multiple Faculties. An Inaugural Class was recruited in 2015 and began their studies in September 2015 with the courses INT D 301 and INT D 306. If the Certificate is approved, these students and students in subsequent classes will be awarded the Certificate upon completion of the required coursework and the stretch experience. Discussion: Dr Geddes reported that a certificate in leadership was one of the key deliverables by the Peter Lougheed Leadership College (PLLC) to obtain provincial funding. She added that the resources for the certificate program are dedicated to this purpose only from the provincial government and other donors. Dr Geddes noted that the Pioneer class entered in 2015. Two of the certificate course have already been approved through normal governance processes and the other two are in process. She added that this certificate will provide students with a different experience, but that it will not be for every student and factors such as space in the program and student schedules will limit participation. Dr Geddes emphasized that the guiding principle of the certificate is that the student’s primary program is the first priority and that the certificate must work with that program. Four INT D courses make up the certificate; the courses are led by Agricultural, Life and Environment Sciences, Arts, Science, and Business. Each of these Faculties has a representative on the Academic Oversight Committee which offers advice and counsel to PLLC and Business on this certificate.The role of Business is academic oversight on academic rules and regulations. She further noted that students in the certificate follow the standard rules on grade appeals and program appeals would go to the Faculty of Business. The courses which comprise the certificate are structured to run one dedicated evening a week with two courses running alternate weeks; it was noted by members that students may have Faculty or other requirements (clinical, practicum, athletics, distance from Augustana) that may preclude students from participating in the program. Dr Geddes confirmed that this would be considered for future development. At this point, the Chair vacated his seat which was taken by Vice-Chair Dr Causgrove Dunn. In response to a question from the group, it was confirmed that students in the Pioneer program are aware that the certificate has not been approved. On a further question of whether this is normal practice, it was confirmed that embedded certificates are awarded at graduation and that it is not unusal for students to have some of the courses which comprise the certificate prior to its approval. There was a question on how students know what Faculty is in charge of the INT D course; it was agreed that course descriptions would be revised to make this clear. The course outlines will also be reviewed, and revised, to ensure all wording is consistent between them. There was discussion on the wording that indicated that, once started, students would be guaranteed to finish their program. Some members noted that this was precedent seting and did not appear in other places. Dr Geddes noted that this was added due to specific concerns from government if this program suddenly ended. Dr Geddes noted that the Faculty was currently working on procedures that would be in place for 2017/18 that would ensure that the student’s primary Faculty would sign off on whether the student could participate while fulfilling their primary program requirements. This process will occur well in advance through a form that students will provide with their application. By January 2017 all the processes will be in place to provide guidance to students and PLLC. The Committee also discussed implications to students who transfer their primary programs, students in undergraduate programs longer than two years, such as Medicine or Dentistry, and the timing of the certificate within a student’s primary program.",

Discussion: The Committee had a discussion on the current Terms of Reference. Comments were made regarding the composition of the Committee and the rationale for Dean membership. A suggestion was made that this could be revised to reflect the current practice of having Associate Deans or individuals with direct responsibility for academic affairs of the Faculty. The rationale for this would be that these individuals have the knowledge-base and experience to evaluate proposals coming forward. A Committee member suggested that the Committee should be mindful of proposals which are wide reaching so that they can be reviewed appropriately. It was also noted that it is important to educate the community on the role of the Committee and the work that is done there. It was agreed that the Terms need to have periodic review. Some concern was expressed that changes should not be made to address a single event, and also that removing all delegation would slow down the process.",

GFC Academic Standards Committee (ASC) Terms of Reference \n(Mandate): The Office of the Provost and Vice-President (Academic) has \ndetermined that the proposed changes are editorial in nature. ASC’s \nterms of reference provide that “the term ‘routine and/or editorial’ \nrefers to proposals which do not involve or affect other Faculties or units; \ndo not form part of a proposal for a new program; and do not involve \nalteration of an existing quota or establishment of a new quota.  Editorial \nor routine changes include any and all changes to the wording of an \nadmissions or academic standing policy” (3.A.i). \nSection 3 of GFC ASC’s Terms of Reference state: \n“B.

In the current wording it may be read that a student is entitled to six years from \nthe time of transfer to complete the course-based degree. The PRC of FGSR proposes new wording \nto make it clear the time to degree is counted from the beginning of the first degree (as would be \nfor any transfer to another program). \nhttp://www.registrar.ualberta.ca/calendar/GradStudies-and-Research/Programs/205.html#205\nhttp://www.registrar.ualberta.ca/calendar/GradStudies-and-Research/Programs/205.html#205\nItem No. 6 \nGFC ACADEMIC STANDARDS COMMITTEE \nFor the Meeting of April 21, 2016 \nOUTLINE OF ISSUE \nAgenda Title: Proposed Changes to Academic Standing (Re-Examination), Faculty of Arts \nMotion:  THAT the GFC Academic Standards Committee approve, with delegated authority from General \nFaculties Council, the changes to academic standing (re-examination) as proposed by the Faculty of Arts, \nand as set forth in Attachment 1, to take effect in 2017/18. \nItem   \nAction Requested Approval Recommendation  Discussion/Advice Information \nProposed by Rebecca Nagel and Allen Ball, Associate Deans, Faculty of Arts \nPresenter Rebecca Nagel, Associate Dean, Faculty of Arts \nSubject Proposed Change to Faculty of Arts Re-Examination Policy  \nDetails \nResponsibility Academic Standards Committee \nThe Purpose of the Proposal is \n(please be specific) \nTo change Faculty of Arts re-examination policy to ensure that students \nwho apply and are approved for re-examination have a realistic chance \nof passing the course after the re-examination has been written. \nThe Impact of the Proposal is  \nOver the last few years, a significant portion of Arts students who apply \nfor and are granted re-examination have little or no chance of success \nbecause their term grades in the re-examination course are also low, \noften because they have not completed the majority of their term \nassignments and exams.  The fee for a re-examination is approximately \n$150.00, and the Faculty considers it unethical to accept the money \nwhen the chance of success is non-existent. For example, a student with \na failing mid-term grade worth 60% of the final grade has no hope of \npassing the course, even if an “A” is earned in a re-examination. \nTo illustrate this, of 83 re-examination applications for Arts students \napproved in the last 4 ½ years, only 49 resulted in a passing grade.  By \nadding criteria related to course work completion and minimum term \ngrade the success rate should rise. \nWhen revising our re-examination policy, we also reviewed similar \npolicies from the Faculties of Business and Science.  These Faculties \nalso include criteria which require students to provide evidence that a \nmedical condition or compelling circumstance affected them at the time \nof writing the final exam.  When we reviewed Arts criteria, we chose not \nto require similar evidence as we wanted to allow for the possibility that \nstudents may just have “bad days” when writing exams.  \nWe also requested feedback regarding the changes from the Faculty of \nArts Undergraduate Student Services Office, and the Departments which \nare most commonly involved in the process for Arts students (Art & \nDesign, Economics, Linguistics, Mathematics and Psychology). \nReplaces/Revises (eg, policies, \nresolutions) \nIntroduces a Re-Examination policy specific to the Faculty of Arts. \nTimeline/Implementation Date Immediate \nItem No. 6 \nGFC ACADEMIC STANDARDS COMMITTEE \nFor the Meeting of April 21, 2016 \nEstimated Cost No additional or new cost to the student. \nSources of Funding Not applicable \nNotes  \nAlignment/Compliance \nAlignment with Guiding \nDocuments \nCompliance with Legislation, \nPolicy and/or Procedure \nRelevant to the Proposal \n(please quote legislation and \ninclude identifying section \nnumbers) \n1.

This program supports the vision of \nthe University of Alberta in Dare to Deliver to build a university for the \npublic good. \nThe Certificate in Interdisciplinary Leadership Studies will also help to \nrealize the vision of the new Institutional Strategic Plan. It will help to \nbuild a diverse, inclusive community of exceptional students, faculty and \nstaff from Alberta, Canada and the world. These students will be able to \nexperience diverse and rewarding learning opportunities, excel as \nindividuals, and together, sustain a culture that fosters and champions \ndistinction and distinctiveness in teaching, learning, research, and \nservice. The Certificate will help students engage with communities \nacross campuses, the province, Canada and the world to create \nreciprocal, mutually beneficial learning experiences, research projects, \npartnerships, and collaborations. \nCompliance with Legislation, \nPolicy and/or Procedure \nRelevant to the Proposal \n(please quote legislation and \ninclude identifying section \nnumbers) \n1. Post-Secondary Learning Act (PSLA): The PSLA gives GFC \nresponsibility, subject to the authority of the Board of Governors, over \nacademic affairs. Further, the PSLA gives the Board of Governors \nauthority over certain admission requirements and rules respecting \nenrolment. The Board has delegated its authority over admissions \nrequirements and rules respecting enrolment to GFC and the GFC ASC. \n(Sections 26(1), 60(1)(c) and (d)). \n2. GFC Academic Standards Committee (ASC) Terms of Reference \n(3. Mandate of the Committee): \n“G. Certificates (All Faculties): Approval Route \nGFC delegated to ASC the authority to approve proposals for the \nestablishment of and termination of credit and non-credit certificates, \nregardless of the proposing academic unit. Where additional funding \nand/or space is required to support the offering of the proposed \ncertificate and/or if, in the opinion of the Provost and Vice-President \n(Academic) (or delegate), the certificate requires Government approval, \nASC would provide a recommendation on the (proposed) initiative to the \nGFC Academic Planning Committee (APC). (GFC 31 MAY 2005) (EXEC \n12 JAN 2009)” \n3. PSLA: The PSLA gives Faculty Councils power to “provide for the \nadmission of students to the faculty” (29(1)(c)). \n4. UAPPOL Admissions Policy: “Admission to the University of Alberta \nis based on documented academic criteria established by individual \nFaculties and approved by GFC. This criteria may be defined in areas \nsuch as subject requirements, minimum entrance averages, and \nlanguage proficiency requirements. In addition to academic requirements \nfor admission, GFC authorizes each Faculty to establish such other \nreasonable criteria for admission of applicants as the Faculty may \nconsider appropriate to its programs of study, subject to the approval of \nGFC (e.g. interview, audition, portfolio, etc.) \nThe admission requirements for any Faculty will be those approved by \nGFC as set forth in the current edition of the University Calendar. In \naddition to the admission requirements, selection criteria for quota \nItem No. 7 \nGFC ACADEMIC STANDARDS COMMITTEE \nFor the Meeting of April 21, 2016 \nprograms, where they exist, will also be published in the current edition \nof the University Calendar. The responsibility for admission decisions will \nbe vested in the Faculty Admission Committees or in the Deans of the \nrespective Faculties, as the councils of such Faculties will determine.” \n5. UAPPOL Admissions Procedure: \n“PROCEDURE \n1. EFFECTIVE DATE OF CHANGES TO ADMISSION REGULATIONS \nFollowing approval by GFC: \na. Where changes to admission regulations may disadvantage students \nin the current admission cycle, normally implementation will be effective \nafter the change has been published in the University Calendar for one \nfull year (i.e., effective the second year that the information is published \nin the University Calendar). \nFor example, a change approved in May 2005 would be first published in \nthe 2006-2007 University Calendar in March 2006. Therefore the \nstatement cannot come into effect until September 2007 (affecting \napplicants who apply for the September 2007 term beginning July 2006). \nb. Where changes to admission regulations are deemed by the \napproving body to be ‘advantageous to students’, normally the date of \nimplementation will be effective immediately or at the next available \nintake for the admitting Faculty.” \n6. PSLA: The PSLA gives Faculty Councils the authority to “determine \nthe conditions under which a student must withdraw from or may \ncontinue the student’s program of studies in a faculty” (Section 29(1)(d)). \n7. UAPPOL Academic Standing Policy: “All current academic standing  \nregulations, including academic standing categories, University \ngraduating standards and requirements for all individual programs will be \nthose prescribed by Faculty Councils and GFC as set forth in the \nUniversity Calendar.” \n8. UAPPOL Academic Standing Regulations Procedures: “All \nproposed new academic standing regulations and changes to existing \nacademic standing regulations will be submitted by the Faculties or the \nAdministration to the Provost and Vice-President (Academic). Faculties \nwill also submit to the Provost and Vice-President (Academic) any \nproposed changes to the use and/or computation of averages relating to \nacademic standing, including promotion and graduation. \nIf the Provost and Vice-President (Academic) determines the proposal to \nbe in good order, the proposal will be introduced to the appropriate \nUniversity governance process(es). In considering these proposals, \ngovernance bodies will consult as necessary with the Faculties and with \nother individuals and offices. \nNormally, changes become effective once they are approved by GFC or \nits delegate and are published in the University Calendar.” \nItem No. 7 \nGFC ACADEMIC STANDARDS COMMITTEE \nFor the Meeting of April 21, 2016 \n9. GFC Executive Committee Terms of Reference (3. Mandate of the \nCommittee) \n“5. Agendas of General Faculties Council \nGFC has delegated to the Executive Committee the authority to decide \nwhich items are placed on a GFC Agenda, and the order in which those \nagenda items appear on each GFC agenda. \n[…] \nWith respect to recommendations from … GFC committees [excluding \nAPC], however, the role of the Executive Committee shall be to examine \nand debate the substance of reports or recommendations and to decide \nif an item is ready to be forwarded to the full governing body.

Identify which \ninstitution(s) will award the \ncredential.  \nUniversity of Alberta \nUnits of Course Weight *12 \nThe Certificate in Interdisciplinary Leadership Studies will be made up of four \ncourses for a total course weight of *12. One of the courses consists primarily of a \ncapstone project. In addition, there is a significant experiential component. Students \nare required to engage in a non-credit stretch experience in the summer between the \nfirst and second year of the program. None of the courses that make up the \nCertificate in Leadership Studies are required courses for a student’s degree. All \ncourses required by this certificate are Senior Electives at the 300 and 400 level. \nProgram Synopsis \nDescribe the program.

The certificate will indicate to \nemployers and graduate schools that the students have taken courses, have \n1\nmailto:martin.ferguson-pell@ualberta.ca\nmailto:martin.ferguson-pell@ualberta.ca\nmailto:elaine.geddes@ualberta.ca\nmailto:elaine.geddes@ualberta.ca\nApril 19, 2016 \nparticipated in co-curricular programs, and have had stretch experiences through \nwhich they have developed the ability to tackle the challenges of leadership in all \naspects of their lives. It will be available to undergraduate students in all Faculties. \nWhile completing their undergraduate degree program in their respective faculties, \nstudents will complete 12 units of course weight. The courses include INT D 301 \nFoundations of Leadership, INT D 306 Topics in Leadership, INT D 406, \nLeadership Capstone Project, INT D 407 Workshop in Leadership.  In addition, a \nnon-credit Stretch Experience in the summer between Years One and Two will be \noffered by PLLC. (See Appendix A for more information).  \nCoursework is delivered with the assistance of Teaching Fellows, most of whom are \ngraduate students or their equivalent, and all of whom are trained to deliver course \ncontent and perform assessment of students. The Teaching Fellows are given \nextensive training in both the content of the course and in instruction, particularly \npedagogical approaches to small group learning. Students work in small \ninterdisciplinary cohorts. Some portions of the lectures are open to the public. \nAll students have an opportunity to be mentored by outstanding members of the \ncommunity who have volunteered their time to be trained in mentorship, and to \nserve as mentors to students. See Appendix E for the Mentorship Team. \nA Pioneer class was enrolled in 2015-16 to run a pilot of the first year of the \nCertificate. If the Certificate is approved, students from this group who wish to \ncontinue would be permitted to enrol in the second year of the Certificate program. \nSection B: Rationale, Implications and Impact  \nRationale for Introduction of \nCertificate \nOutline the rationale for the \nproposed embedded credit \ncertificate and provide supporting \ndata if applicable – eg. Results of \nstudent or economic demand \nanalyses; consultation with wider \ncommunity, etc.   \nIn April 2010 the University of Alberta’s Dean of Students, F. E. Robinson, and the \nRegistrar, G. Kendal, released a proposal, Leadership and the Student Experience. \nThe proposal identified the range and scope of student leadership opportunities and \ninitiatives at the University.  \nAt the end of the proposal the authors recommended the establishment of a \nLeadership College at the University of Alberta. With Henry Marshall Tory’s vision \nin mind, the College’s purpose would be “to honour the brand promise ‘to uplift the \nwhole people’ through leadership, through operation of a residential college.”  \nTheir vision for the Leadership College included the following specific components  \n● Leadership programming provided  \n● Opportunities for formal and informal leadership/learning possibly leading \nto a Certificate in Leadership (emphasis added) \n● Guided by a senior academic “principal in residence”  \n● Residence will house 150 students on North Campus  \n● Guest accommodation for honorary degree recipients, distinguished alumni, \nvisiting speakers etc. \nThe Peter Lougheed Leadership College will create a wide array of opportunities \nfor undergraduates and emerging leaders to gain the skills, experience and \n2\nApril 19, 2016 \nunderstanding so that they may demonstrate excellence in leadership in all their \nwalks of life and use them to the greater benefit of society.  \nThere are many programs already in place on campus that address topics included \nand are therefore a valuable resource to the PLLC and may be in fact augmented by \nPLLC; however, PLLC does not intend to disrupt any of the excellent work already \nin place. \nVision and Academic Plan \nHow does the proposed program \nconnect to the University’s vision \nDare to Discover? How does the \nprogram further the University’s \nAcademic Plan?  \nOne of the four cornerstones of Dare to Discover is “Learning Discovery and \nCitizenship.” An objective for this cornerstone is to “inspire students, faculty, and \nstaff alike to engage in activities that develop leadership, foster social and moral \nresponsibility, and contribute to the further development of our society and its \ninstitutions.”  \nThe PLLC will create a resonance across campus that mobilizes resources, expertise \nand knowledge to involve the broadest range of students, as widely as possible, in \npreparation for their roles as engaged and critically thinking leaders of their \ngeneration. \nThe Certificate in Interdisciplinary Leadership Studies will also help to realize the \nvision of the new Institutional Strategic Plan. It will help to build a diverse, \ninclusive community of exceptional students, faculty and staff from Alberta, \nCanada and the world. These students will be able to experience diverse and \nrewarding learning opportunities, excel as individuals, and together, sustain a \nculture that fosters and champions distinction and distinctiveness in teaching, \nlearning, research, and service. The Certificate will help students engage with \ncommunities across campuses, the province, Canada and the world to create \nreciprocal, mutually beneficial learning experiences, research projects, partnerships, \nand collaborations.  \nResource Implications \nIdentify the resource implications \nof the proposed embedded credit \ncertificate. Identify if resources are \nbeing re-allocated to or from other \nareas, and outline the implications \nof this re-allocation.   \nWhile resources are required to develop and deliver course and program outcomes, \nthe cost for these is being absorbed by the Peter Lougheed Leadership College. The \nCollege is already created and has been funded by a restricted grant from the \nGovernment of Alberta and private donors. The Certificate in Interdisciplinary \nLeadership Studies is one of the central programs promised by PLLC to both the \nGovernment of Alberta and private donors.  Funding to support the Certificate and \nrelated activities is in place, and no funding will be diverted from other University \nof Alberta sources.  No reallocation of resources will take place within the \nUniversity of Alberta. \nAs this is an embedded certificate, students will not be required to take any \nadditional courses beyond those required or permitted in their primary programs. \nThere would normally be no additional tuition fees. Students would not normally \nextend their degree programs in order to complete the certificate, thus there would \nalso not normally be any additional expenses incurred by students. \nEnrolment \nOutline the expected enrolment for \nthe embedded credit certificate and \nany potential impacts on course \nofferings. \nAfter full roll-out, 125 students per year are expected to be accepted into the \nCertificate in Interdisciplinary Leadership Studies making the total head count in \nthe certificate 250 students per year. Students will be given the opportunity to live \nin residence as a “Leadership College” cohort. Participation as a resident will be \nvoluntary and will not be a requirement for being accepted to PLLC. \n3\nApril 19, 2016 \nImplications of Introduction \nof the Credit Certificate \nIdentify the implications of the \nproposed embedded credit \ncertificate for the system. For \nexample, will it affect other \nprograms at the U of A, programs \nat other institutions, etc.?  \nIt is not anticipated that the introduction of the Certificate in Interdisciplinary \nLeadership Studies will affect the enrolment of other programs. The certificate will \nbe embedded within other degree programs so that students will continue in their \nexisting programs after admission to the Certificate. Most programs have sufficient \nelective space within their programs to accommodate the Certificate. It will be up to \neach individual Faculty to decide the extent to which they will accommodate \nstudents if necessary within existing program requirements. Normally, students \nwould not be permitted to take a leave of absence from their primary program to \npursue the certificate. \nThe four Faculties in charge of the four courses that make up the Certificate (ALES, \nArts, Business and Science) form a committee, along with the Vice Provost \nPrograms, called the Academic Oversight Committee that provides advice to the \nFaculty of Business and the PLLC on the content and administration of the \nCertificate. The Academic Oversight Committee also provides advice to the Faculty \nof Business on the administration of the Certificate and on liaison with other \nFaculties. (See Appendix G for the Terms of Reference for the Academic Oversight \nCommittee.)  \nThe Academic Oversight Committee will be responsible for developing review \nmechanisms to ensure continuous quality improvement. Outcomes assessment, \nmeasurement and feedback loops will be established to assist in program \nimprovements. The Faculty of Business has recently gone through a program \nevaluation including the development of a thorough Assurance of Learning process \nso is experienced in leading this type of quality control. The Peter Lougheed \nLeadership College has been conducting thorough and extensive interviews and \nTown Halls with students and with Teaching Fellows of the Pioneer class to get \nfeedback on the pilot program run in 2015-16. This information will be used to \nfurther refine courses and course delivery for 2016-17. \nThe Faculty of Business will have the responsibility of liaison with other Faculties \nto ensure compliance with University and Faculty policies and procedures. \nResources have been allocated to the Faculty of Business from the Peter Lougheed \nLeadership College to ensure that adequate student support services are available \nfor Certificate students without affecting the level of support currently provided to \nBusiness students. The Faculty of Business will also have the responsibility to \nensure that Stretch Experiences are adequately evaluated, supervised and controlled \nto ensure student benefit, The Faculty of Business has extensive experience in \nmonitoring Co-operative Education placements, academic exchanges, student \nconferences, competitions and events, and will be able to exercise oversight in this \narea. Students will be subject to all of the usual controls over student activity with a \nconnection to the University of Alberta, including the Code of Student Behaviour, \nand the Practicum Placement Policy. \nIt is expected that if other faculty-specific leadership certificates are established in \nthe future, some students will enrol in both. Since students are able to enrol in up to \ntwo credit certificates some will take advantage of this opportunity. Students may \nalso take non-leadership certificates offered by other faculties where they have \nsufficient room in their programs. \n4\nApril 19, 2016 \nNo effect on programs at any other institution is anticipated. The Certificate in \nInterdisciplinary Leadership Studies may have a positive effect on recruitment \noverall at the University of Alberta as it becomes more well-known. \nConsultation \nDescribe any consultation and/or \npotential impacts on service units \nof the University, including the \nOffice of the Registrar and Student \nAwards, Academic Information and \nCommunication Technologies \n(AICT), Library Administration, \nFacilities and Operations, Student \nServices, etc.  \nIn 2014-15, prior to the recruitment of the Inaugural Class, the Right Honourable \nKim Campbell, Founding Principal of the PLLC along with Martin Ferguson-Pell, \nwho was at the time Senior Advisor to the President, had extensive consultations \nwith the diverse members of the campus community regarding the Certificate in \nInterdisciplinary Leadership Studies, including with: \n● Members of the PLLC Coordinating Committee and the PLLC Academic \nAdvisory Committee \n● Former Provost, Carl Amhrein \n● Office of the Provost: Olive Yonge, Deputy Provost; Roger Epp, Vice-\nProvost (Academic); Brenda Leskiw, Associate Vice-Provost (Academic \nPrograms and Instruction) \n● Deans of all Faculties \n● General Faculties Council \n● The Student Union \n● The Graduate Students Association \n● Representatives of indigenous people \n● Government Consultation (Municipal, Provincial, Federal) \nPLLC has presented before all committee of the University of Alberta on multiple \noccasions, and in particular before General Faculties Council. As a result of \nconcerns expressed in some of those meetings, an Academic Oversight Committee \nwas established in 2015 to provide for advice, counsel and assistance to the PLLC \non academic and administrative matters. See Appendix B for the makeup of that \ncommittee.  \nThe two courses INT D 301 and INT D 306 have already been approved by the \nUniversity of Alberta through its normal circulation process.

Background \nThe University of Alberta’s Peter Lougheed Leadership College (PLLC), is a broad, inclusive \ncommunity of undergraduate students, graduate teaching fellows and instructors. The \nPLLC creates opportunities for leadership development through enhanced formal and co-\ncurricular programs, experiential learning, and engagement with a wide range of \nleadership styles, commitment to ethical behavior and social responsibility, and with \naccess to excellence in mentorship.  \nThe work of the PLLC is guided by the following foundational statements: \nVision Statement \nThe Peter Lougheed Leadership College is a thriving and vibrant centre of excellence for \nleadership development where students are immersed in and benefit from leading-edge \nlearning experiences. \nMission Statement \nThe Peter Lougheed Leadership College is dedicated to creating an exceptional \ninterdisciplinary, multiple campus and collaborative learning environment in which students \ngain the attributes, skills and competencies essential for their life endeavors. \nPLLC Values and Principles  \nAs part of the University of Alberta, the PLLC relies on the shared values of the University \nof Alberta that are centred on the principle of “uplifting of the whole people” and form the \nbedrock for our behaviour and guides our actions and interactions. These values represent \nhow the PLLC expects to travel toward fulfillment of its mission and vision.  \nPLLC values Principles of Practice that reflect PLLC values \nEmbodiment of \nleadership \npractices  \nBased on the example set by Peter Lougheed, the work of the PLLC will model and \nset an example for the leadership practices of ethical responsibility, authenticity, \ncritical/strategic thinking, effective communication, and acting with integrity.   \nDiversity of \nlearning \nexperiences \n● The student-centred learning approach at the PLLC will utilize a range of \nlearning processes including cutting edge digital learning, experiential \nlearning, opportunity to participate in an immersive residential experience, \nand mentorship.  \n● Formal learning experiences will be evidence-based and closely linked to \nscholarship in leadership practices. \nInterdisciplinary \ncollaboration \nand synergy \nFrom design to delivery, the PLLC will identify and utilize the wealth of \nexperience, scholarship, and collective wisdom of the academy, its partners, and \nthe broader community to optimize learning experiences for all.  \n20\nApril 19, 2016 \nAccessible \nparticipation  \nThe inclusive approach to leadership development at PLLC ensures that:  \n● The composition of the PLLC leadership cohorts are representative of the \nUniversity of Alberta campus as a whole.  \n● Leadership opportunities are coordinated and shared across the entire \ncampus as the college serves the university as a catalyst for excellence in \nleadership practice and mentoring in any setting. \nII. The PLLC Leadership Certificate \nA key component of the PLLC is an embedded academic certificate.  As an administrative \nunit of a UofA presidential initiative, the PLLC operates in collaboration with the UofA \nacademic system.   Therefore, to meet the academic oversight and governance \nrequirements for an embedded certificate, the academic certificate will be hosted by a \ndesignated faculty. As well, to support the inter-disciplinary nature of the PLLC, each of the \nacademic credit courses will be offered by a different faculty.    \nThis complex context presents unique challenges and opportunities for the PLLC, and the \nuniversity, and will require a strong collaborative and coordinated relationship between \nthe PLLC and the partnering Faculties.  The PLLC recognizes that each of the Faculties \noffering a PLLC leadership course is ultimately responsible for the content, academic \noversight, governance approval, and delivery of that course.  The host Faculties see \nsignificant benefit from the active advisory engagement of the PLLC during course and \ncertificate development, as well as in an ongoing capacity. An Academic Oversight \nCommittee (AOC) will utilized to achieve the optimum collaborative benefit.  \nIII. The Leadership Role of the Peter Lougheed Leadership College \nAcademic Oversight Advisory Committee \nUtilizing a collaborative and collegial approach the AOC members will work with the PLLC \nadministrative unit to support the development of development and delivery of a superior \nquality embedded certificate, and its components, and the PLLC as an important multi-\ncampus initiative.  \nA key leadership role of the committee will be to utilize the combined governance \nexperience of its members to create clarity and consensus regarding the roles, \nrelationships and responsibilities pertaining to the development (including required \napprovals) and delivery of the courses and the overarching certificate. In undertaking this \nrole, the Committee recognizes that the host Faculties have ultimate responsibility for \ngovernance processes relating to the individual courses and certificate.  \n21\nApril 19, 2016 \nThe Academic Oversight Committee (AOC) will: \n● Create and utilize a governance and academic oversight strategy to clarify roles, \nresponsibilities, and relationships that supports a two-way (PLLC and AOC) mentoring \nand learning process and a collaborative commitment to academic excellence.    \n● Seek ongoing input from the PLLC on course and certificate content; and \n● Work with the Faculties to ensure the courses are aligned, as much as possible, with \nPLLC values and principles. \nThe leadership efforts of the AOC will benefit four specific stakeholder groups:  \n● Students will benefit from an academically rigorous, enriching and valuable learning \nexperience that contributes to their academic program requirements, and provides \nopportunity for leadership development in an inter-disciplinary environment.  \n● The University of Alberta will benefit from the collaboration and synergies between \nthe PLLC and the academic community through: \no Provision of a program and experience that distinguishes the UofA in the \nfield of inter-disciplinary leadership development.   \no Development of governance protocols, principles and implementation \nprocesses that can serve as examples for other inter-disciplinary initiatives.  \n● The hosting Faculties will benefit from the work of the committee by: \no Increased clarity and broadly shared knowledge of the intentions of the PLLC \nand of the leadership certificate within that context;  \no Clarity of roles, relationships and responsibilities in certificate and course \ndevelopment, the required approvals, and program delivery; \no A shared confidence in the credibility of the academic certificate; \no Support and advice from the committee throughout the approval processes; \nand \no Leadership development opportunities through affiliation with the PLLC.  \n● The benefits to PLLC from working with the AOC committee will include: \no Having a cohesive, collaborative, and collegial academic body to support the \nPLLC certificate; \no Shared commitment to a strong, credible and valuable academic certificate; \no Shared and consistent communication to the academic community through a \nformal conduit which provides the ability to share the overall picture and \nintention of the PLLC and the leadership certificate—PLLC activities and \nvalues will be accurately represented to the academy; \no Strong and focussed relationships with the academic community;   \no Ability to further develop knowledge about UofA governance practices and \nimplementation by accessing the governance expertise from the committee \nmembers; and \n22\nApril 19, 2016 \no Developing and sharing a model that can be used by other University \ninitiatives.  \ni. AOC Membership  \nThe membership of the AOC will consist of: \n● Vice Provost (Academic)  to serve as chair of the committee \n● PLLC representative \n● Representative from the Certificate Hosting Faculty \n● Associate Deans (Undergraduate Programs) or Dean’s designate from : \no Host Faculty Foundations of Leadership Course – Faculty of Arts \no Host Faculty Topics in Leadership Course – Faculty of ALES \no Host Faculty Experiential Workshops – Alberta School of Business  \no Host Faculty Capstone Course – Faculty of Science  \nii.
