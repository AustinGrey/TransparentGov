Discussion: Dr Zwicker provided members with a summary of the Report, noting that out of the 7500 graduate students, a third are doctoral students, and the rest Masters students. She pointed out a softening in doctorial enrolment, perhaps due to a decline in the professoriate, which was caused by budget cuts. She explained that the graduate student body is comprised of a high percentage of international students, and that this cohort of students are unevenly distributed across Faculties. She stated that as such, each Faculty has their own vulnerabilities in regards to international students, and that this can even be impacted by changes in the relations between countries. She explained that more could be done to attract and retain Indigenous and Metis students. She reported that the admission GPA has remained high, and that time to completion is steady or declining. She explained that attrition rates are difficult to calculate because there are a variety of situations and life events which can factor in. She noted, however, that international students tend to complete their programs faster. Members expressed thanks for the Report, and engaged in discussion related to full and part-time status. Members pointed out that several Faculties have seen a decline in graduate funding, which have impacted both graduate and undergraduate education. A member suggested tracking online students, as it is a growing area with important implications for teaching load and resources. Finally, members discussed leave options for graduate students. Dr Zwicker confirmed that the Report is publicly available.",

Discussion: Dr Mundel explained to members that this proposal has been an important priority for members at Augustana Faculty and that a significant amount of work has gone into its development. To summarize, he stated that the proposal intends to transform the 13 week term into two sessions which would include one three week block in which students would only be able to take one course, followed by an 11 week session in which students could take four courses (“3-11” calendar). He added that it would allow Augustana Faculty to provide a more immersive learning experience and to link courses together. He also provided members with a summary of the Augustana First Year Experience, intended to help students transition into university life. The Chair stated that initiaves like this are tied to rankings. Members expressed support for this proposal, indicating that this type of exciting, creative endeavour should be encouraged across the academy. A member also commended Dr Mundel on the Augustana First Year Experience, noting that many students struggle to successfully transition into university. Dr Mundel, in response to queries, confirmed that there was consultation with the Registrar’s Office as well as the Peter Lougheed Leadership College. A member sought clarification surrounding the timing of the seminar, as outlined within the proposal. The Chair thanked Dr Mundel for his presentation.",

            "Description": "Purpose of the Proposal: For discussion and feedback. Input will be used in the refinement of the new institutional strategic plan (ISP). Discussion: Dr Bailey reported that following an extensive, thorough consultation process, members of the ISP Advisory Committee have prepared a draft document, which is now being presented across the academy for another round of feedback. Dr Dambrowitz explained that ISP will represent the institution’s aspirations in one document, to guide academic and administrative decision-making, priorities and governance. She stated that the first round of consultation has ended, and the project now enters Phase Two, which includes a review of the draft document. She reminded members that the ISP will be presented to the Board of Governors for approval on June 17, 2016. In addition, Dr Dambrowitz acknowledged the feedback and suggestions previously offered by members of GFC ASC, and added that several ideas were incorporated into the draft document. Dr Bailey reported that the draft is constructed around five verbs: Build, Experience, Excel, Engage, Sustain. She explained that the document is written in several layers, so that readers can peruse it in three minutes, read it in 30 minutes, or explore it in three hours. She also pointed out that the order of the five verbs is not an indication of priority. The Chair invited members to provide commentary on the draft ISP. During the lengthy discussion on this item, members expressed support for the title of the documents, and provided several comments and suggestions for the document. A member expressed concern that emphasizing alignment with the Provincial Government may undermine academic freedom and institutional autonomy, and suggested using another word, such as “dialogue” in place of “alignment”. In addition, a member identified concern with content in the draft ISP which seemingly supports the myth that Arts and Science degrees are not inherently valuable. On this note, the Chair stated that there is often an institutional sentiment of insecurity, and that we need to aspire to be something different, when the academy is already clearly already excellent. A member noted that North Campus seemed to be missing in the document. Members then engaged in a discussion surrounding the budget model of the university, and the Chair suggested that perhaps this could be explained in more detail. A member noted that her Faculty seems to be absent from the document altogether, as it is neither Arts, Science or a professional program. A member stated that breadth in the document could also be interpreted as a way to separate and alienate, as well. A member explained that the academy is more than just teaching and learning, and suggested that culture is important, and the fact that members of the community are inquisitive and brave in addressing certain subjects. The Chair thanked the presenters for their discussion, and Dr Dambrowitz invited members to contribute any other feedback via email.",

Post-Secondary Learning Act (PSLA): The PSLA gives GFC \nresponsibility, subject to the authority of the Board of Governors, over \nacademic affairs. Further, the PSLA gives the Board of Governors \nauthority over certain admission requirements and rules respecting \nenrolment. The Board has delegated its authority over admissions \nrequirements and rules respecting enrolment to GFC and the GFC ASC \n(Academic Standards Committee). (Sections 26(1), 60(1)(c) and (d)). \n2.  PSLA:  The PSLA gives Faculty Councils power to “provide for the \nadmission of students to the faculty” (29(1)(c)). \n3. UAPPOL Admissions Policy: “Admission to the University of Alberta \nis based on documented academic criteria established by individual \nFaculties and approved by GFC. This criteria may be defined in areas \nGFC ACADEMIC STANDARDS COMMITTEE \nFor the Meeting of March 17, 2016 \nItems No. 4A – 4C \nsuch as subject requirements, minimum entrance averages, and \nlanguage proficiency requirements. In addition to academic requirements \nfor admission, GFC authorizes each Faculty to establish such other \nreasonable criteria for admission of applicants as the Faculty may \nconsider appropriate to its programs of study, subject to the approval of \nGFC (e.g. interview, audition, portfolio, etc.) \nThe admission requirements for any Faculty will be those approved by \nGFC as set forth in the current edition of the University Calendar. In \naddition to the admission requirements, selection criteria for quota \nprograms, where they exist, will also be published in the current edition \nof the University Calendar. \nThe responsibility for admission decisions will be vested in the Faculty \nAdmission Committees or in the Deans of the respective Faculties, as \nthe councils of such Faculties will determine.” \n4.  UAPPOL Admissions Procedure: \n“PROCEDURE \n1. EFFECTIVE DATE OF CHANGES TO ADMISSION REGULATIONS \nFollowing approval by GFC: \na. Where changes to admission regulations may disadvantage students \nin the current admission cycle, normally implementation will be effective \nafter the change has been published in the University Calendar for one \nfull year (i.e., effective the second year that the information is published \nin the University Calendar). \nFor example, a change approved in May 2005 would be first published in \nthe 2006-2007 University Calendar in March 2006. Therefore the \nstatement cannot come into effect until September 2007 (affecting \napplicants who apply for the September 2007 term beginning July \n2006).” \nb. Where changes to admission regulations are deemed by the \napproving body to be ‘advantageous to students’, normally the date of \nimplementation will be effective immediately or at the next available \nintake for the admitting Faculty.” \n5.  PSLA: The PSLA gives Faculty Councils the authority to “determine \nthe conditions under which a student must withdraw from or may \ncontinue the student’s program of studies in a faculty” (Section 29(1)(d)). \n6. UAPPOL Academic Standing Policy:  “All current academic \nstanding regulations, including academic standing categories, University \ngraduating standards and requirements for all individual programs will be \nthose prescribed by Faculty Councils and GFC as set forth in the \nUniversity Calendar.” \n7. UAPPOL Academic Standing Regulations Procedures: “All \nproposed new academic standing regulations and changes to existing \nGFC ACADEMIC STANDARDS COMMITTEE \nFor the Meeting of March 17, 2016 \nItems No. 4A – 4C \nacademic standing regulations will be submitted by the Faculties or the \nAdministration to the Provost and Vice-President (Academic). Faculties \nwill also submit to the Provost and Vice-President (Academic) any \nproposed changes to the use and/or computation of averages relating to \nacademic standing, including promotion and graduation. \nIf the Provost and Vice-President (Academic) determines the proposal to \nbe in good order, the proposal will be introduced to the appropriate \nUniversity governance process(es). In considering these proposals, \ngovernance bodies will consult as necessary with the Faculties and with \nother individuals and offices. \nNormally, changes become effective once they are approved by GFC or \nits delegate and are published in the University Calendar.” \n8. GFC Academic Standards Committee (ASC) Terms of Reference \n(Mandate): The Office of the Provost and Vice-President (Academic) has \ndetermined that the proposed changes are editorial in nature. ASC’s \nterms of reference provide that “the term ‘routine and/or editorial’ \nrefers to proposals which do not involve or affect other Faculties or units; \ndo not form part of a proposal for a new program; and do not involve \nalteration of an existing quota or establishment of a new quota.  Editorial \nor routine changes include any and all changes to the wording of an \nadmissions or academic standing policy” (3.A.i). \nSection 3 of GFC ASC’s Terms of Reference state: \n“B. Admission and Transfer, Academic Standing, Marking and \nGrading, Term Work, Examinations, International Baccalaureate \n(IB), Advanced Placement (AP) \ni.  All proposals from the Faculties or the Administration related to \nadmission and transfer, to the academic standing of students, to \ninstitutional marking and grading policies and/or procedures and to \nterm work policies and procedures are submitted to the Provost and \nVice-President (Academic) (or delegate) who chairs the GFC \nAcademic Standards Committee. ASC will consult as necessary with \nthe Faculties and with other individuals and offices in its \nconsideration of these proposals. (GFC 29 SEP 2003) (GFC 31 MAY \n2005) (EXEC 04 DEC 2006) \nii.

Overall, this report confirms what our everyday interactions with graduate students \nsuggest: that our programs are attractive (application rates have traditionally been high), our \nstudents are strong (consistently showing high admission GPAs), our support systems are \nworking (the attrition rate rarely exceeds 20%), and our supervision is conscientious (our time to \ncompletion is stable, and competitive with Canadian and American averages).   \nGraduate recruitment, admission and enrolment are highly decentralized. Our 7500 graduate \nstudents work in over 300 research areas with 250 official specializations. The Faculty of \nGraduate Studies and Research exerts a centripetal force in this context, and is in a prime \nposition to collate disparate data and connect local to national and international trends. By its \nnature, this report looks to the past: five to ten years, depending on the availability and reliability \nof data. The historical knowledge it offers will allow us to chart the right course for the future. \nAmong the important insights contained here: after a decade of growth, doctoral enrolments \nmay be softening, particularly in Arts and Science. Since PhD enrolment is closely tied to the \nsize of the professoriate and to available research dollars, both of which have stalled, this \nmakes sense. (Anecdotal evidence suggests this is a national trend.) On the other hand, \ndemand for course-based Master’s programs continues to surge. The Province of Alberta does \nnot have a specific designation for Professional Master’s programs, but a deeper dive into the \nenrolment data presented here might support the call for such a distinction. The information on \ntime to completion demonstrates that international students complete their degrees more quickly \nthan do domestic students (including Permanent Residents). Attrition rates are highest in thesis-\nbased programs. The cost – to students and to the institution – of doctoral non-completion is \nhigh, and deserves further thought. The number of First Nations, Métis and Inuit (FNMI) \napplicants and students is very low. If the University identifies FNMI recruitment as a strategic \ngoal, special consideration must be given to bringing those students into graduate programs. \nA few notes on data and methodology: all graduate enrolment data is expressed in terms of \nheadcount rather than Full Load Equivalent (FLE). Headcount is the only reliable way to count \ngraduate students, since the FLE calculation over-estimates the number of students, due to a \nchanging denominator (number of credits). Wherever possible, we have used the December 1st \nheadcount, which provides the most accurate snapshot, capturing all of the students who start \ntheir studies in September and excluding everyone who completes their program during the fall \nsemester. However, even the December 1st headcount is only a snapshot: in a minority of \nFaculties, there can be a significant influx of students during the other semesters, and that will \nnot be captured here. \nWherever possible, we have used the University of Alberta data warehouse as our statistical \nsource. For some of the more historical analysis, however, we have used in-house FGSR \nfigures. These figures do not always square with one another. In future editions, we will be able \nto rely on the data warehouse exclusively, solving the problem of inconsistency.  \nYour comments and questions – about this report or its successors – are very welcome. One \nelement that we know would be welcome is benchmarking to national and international \nstandards. Frustratingly, much of the comparative data is privacy-protected or out of date; we \nhope that future enrolment reports will provide more comparative data.  \n3 \nI must close with a note of appreciation for my predecessor, Dr. Mazi Shirvani, who compiled a \ngreat deal of data concerning graduate students in his seven years as Dean of the Faculty. I \nalso appreciate the contributions of Deborah Williams, Gurpinder Gandhara and Denise Giles. \nOf course, I accept responsibility for any shortcomings. \nFGSR welcomes the opportunity to be a key partner in strategic enrolment management and \npresents this report with great pride. \nHeather Zwicker, PhD \nInterim Vice-Provost and Dean, Faculty of Graduate Studies and Research \n3 February 2016 \n4 \n1. Enrolment \nIn this section, all numbers are the standard December 1st headcounts, as reported to Statistics \nCanada and the provincial government.  \nVariation in graduate enrolment from one academic year to the next is due to three independent \nfactors. The number increases by the total number of new registrations, and it decreases by \nthe number of those leaving, through convocation or through attrition (see section 3). As an \naggregate measure, enrolment variations have to be understood with reference to the changes \nin these three factors. \nIt is also worth noting that this enrolment figure is a point-in-time snapshot, and does not show \nthe total number of graduate students who have been on campus at various points during the \nyear. (December 1st headcounts are a snapshot of the Fall Term registrations only.)  \n1.1 Graduate Enrolment by Degree Type \nThis graph demonstrates the overall increase in graduate enrolment over the last decade: from \n6541 (2511 doctoral +2111 Master’s thesis-based +1919 Master’s course-based) to 7228 (2777 \ndoctoral + 1966 Master’s thesis-based +2408 Master’s course-based). The largest increase has \nbeen in course-based Master’s programs, suggesting that an appetite for Professional Master’s \nprograms is strong. \nSource: FGSR Statistics & Strategic Analysis and Data Warehousing, Enrolment Management Report – January 7, \n2016 \n2511 \n2610 \n2693 \n2770 \n2944 \n2862 \n2937 \n3066 3019 2975 \n2777 \n2111 2109 2165 \n2212 \n2350 \n2,183 2,200 2,207 2,217 \n2,128 \n1966 1919 1964 \n2177 \n2343 \n2568 \n2,209 \n2,272 2,255 \n2,360 2,391 \n2408 \n1800\n2000\n2200\n2400\n2600\n2800\n3000\n3200\nHe\nad\nco\nun\nt \nAcademic Year \nDoctoral Master's Thesis - Based Master's Course-Based\n5 \n1.2 Graduate Enrollment – Fall Headcount for Doctoral Degree by Faculty  \nSource: Strategic Analysis and Data Warehousing, Enrolment Management Report – January 7, 2016 \nFaculty 2010-2011 2011-2012 2012-2013 2013-2014 2014-2015 2015-2016 \nALES 219 215 245 235 237 230 \nArts 458 463 472 478 451 413 \nBusiness 61 53 59 61 51 45 \nEducation 270 291 296 291 295 257 \nEngineering 610 666 717 702 711 678 \nExtension       \nFaculte Saint-Jean       \nFaculty of Native \nStudies       \nLaw 4 8 8 8 7 7 \nMedicine and \nDentistry 281 303 319 316 340 342 \nNursing 80 74 69 63 68 64 \nPharmacy 38 34 34 33 32 32 \nPhysical Educ. & \nRecreation 65 62 60 65 55 56 \nPublic Health 40 42 42 43 45 50 \nRehabilitation \nMedicine 33 34 36 38 36 37 \nScience 703 692 709 686 646 566 \nTotal 2862 2937 3066 3019 2975 2777 \n6 \n1.3 Graduate Enrollment – Fall Headcount for Master’s Degree by Faculty  \nSource: Strategic Analysis and Data Warehousing, Enrolment Management Report – January 7, 2016 \n  2010-2011 2011-2012 2012-2013 2013-2014 2014-2015 2015-2016 \nFaculty M-C M-T Total M-C M-T Total M-C M-T Total M-C M-T Total M-C M-T Total M-C M-T Total \nALES 14 260 274 18 248 266 14 249 263 26 258 284 22 261 283 22 244 266 \nArts 123 331 454 134 346 480 114 313 427 105 311 416 105 269 374 90 240 330 \nBusiness 430  430 447  447 449  449 499  499 544 1 545 558  558 \nEducation 446 89 535 523 99 622 499 97 596 496 85 581 547 80 627 568 70 638 \nEngineering 375 483 858 304 491 795 189 496 685 148 566 714 93 545 638 36 527 563 \nExtension 51 1 52 59 1 60 58 2 60 49 2 51 54 1 55 55  55 \nFaculté Saint-\nJean 34 16 50 37 18 55 30 20 50 24 16 40 16 13 29 21 8 29 \nLaw 2 6 8 5 5 10 1 8 9 2 6 8  4 4  5 5 \nMedicine and \nDentistry 4 270 274 2 287 289 2 277 279 2 265 267  281 281 2 260 262 \nNative \nStudies       1 7 8  10 10  7 7  12 12 \nNursing 42 44 86 44 28 72 39 43 82 45 33 78 49 29 78 47 20 67 \nPharmacy   22 22  25 25  21 21  13 13  17 17  18 18 \nPhysical \nEduc. & \nRecreation \n9 58 67 14 59 73 15 64 79 16 57 73 18 49 67 19 44 63 \nPublic Health 122 88 210 132 91 223 135 95 230 149 99 248 144 100 244 131 80 211 \nRehabilitation \nMedicine 496 42 538 499 38 537 621 37 658 708 41 749 709 39 748 748 48 796 \nScience 61 473 534 54 464 518 88 478 566 91 455 546 90 432 522 111 390 501 \nTotal 2,209 2,183 4,392 2,272 2,200 4,472 2,255 2,207 4,462 2,360 2,217 4,577 2,391 2,128 4,519 2,408 1,966 4,374 \nM-C = Master’s Course-Based, M-T = Master’s Thesis-Based \nThis table demonstrates a steady increase in enrolments in course-based Master’s degrees. \nThis may be because of increasing interest – on the part of students and on the part of the \nuniversity – in professional Master’s degrees.

Although sponsored \nstudents represent only about 5% of international graduate students, it is a segment of the \nstudent population that has grown. \nAlmost 70% of sponsored students have been in doctoral programs. The duration of \nsponsorships has been between one and six years, although the majority of them last three or \nfour years.  \n 2009-2010 2010-2011 2011-2012 2012-2013 2013-2014 2014-2015 Total \nChina 18 28 29 39 27 49 190 \nSaudi Arabia 26 17 18 24 13 18 116 \nMexico 14 15 4 9 4 6 52 \nVietnam 4 7 8 4 5 2 30 \nLibya 0 5 0 3 5 10 23 \nBrazil 0 1 2 3 1 9 16 \nChile 3 4 6 2 1 0 16 \nColombia 2 2 3 2 3 4 16 \nKazakhstan 2 6 1 3 2 0 14 \nPakistan 7 1 4 2 0 0 14 \nEgypt 6 1 0 1 1 2 11 \nThe China Scholarship Council (CSC) is one of our most important sponsoring partners. \nAccording to a CSC report from 2013, University of Alberta is their top global partner.2 This is a \nvaluable connection, but we must keep an eye on the trend, since we do not want to risk \nbuilding on a narrow base. Other partners include the King Abdullah Scholarship Program, \nColfuturo, the Vietnam Ministry of Education and Training, Ministry of Higher Education of \nEgypt, and the Canadian Commonwealth Scholarship Program. \n1 There were 106 sponsored students reported in the first year of the program (2008-2009), but we have not completed the \nverification of their status. \n2 Since fall 2012, FGSR has paid the domestic tuition and non-instructional fees for all new winners of the four-year CSC doctoral \nscholarships, and the Provost’s Office has paid the international differential tuition for these students. \n10 \n1.7 Enrolment by Gender \nThe graphs below also include students registered in graduate certificate and diplomas in \naddition to the three degree program types offered.

As the following table \nshows, FNMI students are particularly interested in course-based Master’s programs. \nEnrolment \nSource: FGSR Statistics \n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\n100\n120\n140\nHe\nad\nco\nun\nt \nAcademic Year \nApplications Applicants Admitted Applicants Registered\n0\n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\n60\n70\nHe\nad\nco\nun\nt \nAcademic Year \nDoctoral Master's Thesis-Based Master's Course-Based\n13 \n2. Applications and Admissions \nFollowing a fairly rapid rise for several years, the number of applicants for admission3  has been \ndeclining since the 2012-2013 academic year, in both the domestic and the international \napplicant pools. Expanding the pool of qualified applicants is a component of active recruitment \nstrategies. \nThe yield rate (the percentage of registrations resulting from offers of admission) has been \nextremely steady, at about two thirds. Increasing the yield rate is another component of active \nrecruitment strategies. \nWe have an extremely diverse pool of international applicants, which has resulted in one of the \nmost international graduate student populations in the country (on par with UBC). This is \nparticularly true at the doctoral level. At the same time, however, we have observed a decline in \nthe number of domestic doctoral applicants, contrary to the national trend. An effective domestic \ndoctoral recruitment strategy is one option for reversing this trend. \nBy contrast, international applicants remain a relatively small part of the applicant pool for our \ncourse-based Master’s programs – contrary to much of the commentary concerning the \nattractiveness of these programs to international students. Marketing and promotion of our \ncourse-based Master’s programs may be necessary as the University proceeds with the \ndevelopment of new programs. \nExpanding the pool of qualified First Nations, Métis, and Inuit (FNMI) applicants requires careful \nplanning and recruitment strategies.  \nThere is gender imbalance in the number of applications for different degrees, with doctoral \nprograms attracting almost twice as many male as female applicants, while the proportion is \nalmost reversed for course-based Master’s programs. Female applicants tend to have a higher \nyield rate than their male counterparts. \n3 Our institutional graduate admission requirements are having a degree equivalent to a U of A baccalaureate degree, having an \nadmission GPA of at least 3.0, and a reasonable English Language Proficiency score if from an institution where the main language \nof instruction was not English. Numerous programs set higher standards. At the same time, programs can waive some of the \nstandards for a particular applicant in the light of other circumstances.  \n14 \n2.1 Graduate Admissions \nThe following graph shows the total number4 of applications for admission to graduate \nprograms, the number of offers of admissions made, and the number of subsequent \nregistrations. (Please note some applicants may have submitted more than one application.)  \nSource: FGSR Statistics \nAnecdotal evidence suggests that the trend at University of Alberta – a peak in 2012-13 leading \nto a period of decline – is consistent with national trends, particularly at the PhD level. However, \nup-to-date U-15 data is not yet available to confirm this.  \n4 The numbers given are for those applying in a given academic year. The date of first registration is frequently in a different \nacademic year. Unlike the vast majority of undergraduate students, almost 15% of graduate students do not start in the fall term. \n5948 \n6469 \n7301 7157 \n8076 \n9184 9259 \n10309 9855 \n9298 \n2696 2834 \n3224 3180 3619 3383 3323 3464 3402 3040 \n1888 1945 2202 2226 2509 2393 2342 2558 2538 2063 \n0\n2000\n4000\n6000\n8000\n10000\n12000\nHe\nad\nco\nun\nt \nAcademic Year \nApplications Applicants Admitted Applicants Registered\n15 \n2.2 Domestic Graduate Admissions \nSource: FGSR Statistics \nBetween 2011-2012 and 2014-2015, the number of domestic doctoral applicants fell by more \nthan 30%, the number of Master’s thesis-based applicants was almost stable, and the number \nof Master’s course-based applicants grew by almost 24%. The declines in offers and \nregistrations were in both doctoral and Master’s course-based pools.  \nThe ten-year trend, however, shows an increase of 23% in applications and, concomitantly, a \ndecline from 42% (1397 of 3352) to 39% in our admit rate. A decline in the number of applicants \nadmitted demonstrates greater selectiveness: an important quality indicator. \nIt is noteworthy that yield rates for domestic applicants have always been significantly higher \nthan for international (around 75%, versus under 60%). \n3352 3521 \n3981 \n3732 3723 \n3955 3755 \n4456 4449 4132 \n1833 1903 \n2102 1945 2037 1980 1857 1923 1892 1594 \n1397 1435 1586 1495 1588 1551 1456 1560 1515 \n1165 \n0\n1000\n2000\n3000\n4000\n5000\n6000\nHe\nad\nco\nun\nt \nAcademic Year \nApplications Applicants Admitted Applicants Registered\n16 \n2.3 International Graduate Admissions  \nApplicants on a study permit form an increasingly large part of the total graduate applicant pool.  \nSource: FGSR Statistics \nAs is the case with domestic admissions, the ten-year trend here is remarkable, with \ninternational applicants more than doubling (at their peak) over the last decade. Admission rate \nin 2005-06 was 30% (734 of 2449); in 2014-15 it is down to 25.6%. Again, this is an indication of \nquality. \nThe decline of more than 11% since 2012-2013 is mainly in the doctoral (19%) and Master’s \nthesis-based (10%) pools. The number of offers and registrations has grown for the international \ndoctoral and Master’s course-based pools. The increase in doctoral offers on a shrinking pool of \napplicants is an issue to be addressed.  \n2449 \n2828 \n3166 3243 \n4177 \n5050 5312 \n5604 \n5106 4971 \n734 836 \n1000 1087 \n1431 1252 1317 1319 1227 1275 \n382 422 504 597 \n792 714 768 814 797 761 \n0\n1000\n2000\n3000\n4000\n5000\n6000\nHe\nad\nco\nun\nt \nAcademic Year \nApplications Applicants Admitted Applicants Registered\n17 \nAdmissions Grade Point Average (AGPA)  \nThe admissions grade point average (AGPA)5 is one of the basic eligibility criteria for graduate \nadmissions, although it is not usually a final determining factor.

Convocation and Completion \nThis section provides information on graduate students obtaining graduate degrees by \ngraduating cohort. This means looking at the cohort who graduated in a given year. An \nalternative is to take a cohort who started in a particular year, and analyze their various \ncharacteristics over time. The method used here provides a more accurate picture of completion \ntimes, while the other method is to be used for analyzing completion and attrition rates. \n3.1 Number of Graduate Degrees Granted  \nSource: FGSR Statistics \nThis chart does not show the small but increasing number of post-baccalaureate certificates that \nare also awarded: typically, now, two to three dozen per year.  \n325 304 370 352 \n368 373 361 \n416 489 450 \n555 493 512 509 526 545 \n644 626 647 599 \n618 605 651 654 \n770 \n880 936 925 \n987 974 \n0\n200\n400\n600\n800\n1000\n1200\nHe\nad\nco\nun\nt \nAcademic Year \nDoctoral Master's Thesis-Based Master's Course-Based\n20 \n3.2 Average Completion Times by Degree Type \nEfforts have been underway to reduce completion times, particularly for doctoral students. As \nthe chart below shows, however, times to completion have remained relatively stable for the last \ndecade. An investigation of the distribution of completion times, particularly for doctoral \nstudents, may be warranted. This will answer questions such as whether the average \ncompletion times are being skewed by a relatively small number of students taking an inordinate \namount of time to complete their programs. \nSource for this section: FGSR Statistics \nAcademic  \nYear Doctoral M-T M-C \n2005-2006 5.6 2.88 2.58 \n2006-2007 5.45 2.85 2.59 \n2007-2008 5.57 2.96 2.56 \n2008-2009 5.77 2.87 2.58 \n2009-2010 5.83 2.82 2.48 \n2010-2011 5.88 2.85 2.33 \n2011-2012 5.63 2.7 2.32 \n2012-2013 5.63 2.79 2.33 \n2013-2014 5.67 2.78 2.36 \n2014-2015 5.67 2.71 2.27 \nM-T = Master’s Thesis-Based, M-C = Master’s Course-Based \n3.3 Average Completion Times by Citizenship  \nInternational graduate students complete their degrees significantly faster.

The remainder consists of those who have left the University without any \ncredential. \nAttrition rates and attrition times (how long it takes a graduate student to stop having a \nregistration without having obtained a credential) are matters that the University has to \nunderstand and monitor.   \nThe issue is subtle: The attrition rate in 2005-2006 was about 21.5%, while the attrition rate in \n2009-2010 was about 14.7%. This number, however, can rise to as high as 27%, depending on \nhow many of the 2009-2010 students who are still registered eventually convocate with a \ndegree. \nIn the aggregate table that follows, we decline to calculate attrition rates for cohorts that fall \nwithin the average time to completion of a PhD (5.67 years, or 2010-11) – of course, this hides \nthe Master’s rates. The program-specific tables that follow break out this information more fully. \nIt must be emphasized that attrition rates become more speculative as we move toward the \npresent. \nAcademic  \nYear \nApplicants \nRegistered Convocations Still Active Remaining \nAttrition \nRate \n2005-2006 1897 1479 9 409 21.5% \n2006-2007 1951 1552 27 372 19.0% \n2007-2008 2204 1740 52 412 18.7% \n2008-2009 2228 1701 139 388 17.4% \n2009-2010 2516 1840 305 371 14.7% \n2010-2011 2397 1553 529 315 N/A \n2011-2012 2345 1355 698 292 N/A \n2012-2013 2563 1024 1215 324 N/A \n2013-2014 2538 352 1959 227 N/A \n2014-2015 2063 5 2037 21 N/A \n22 \n3.4.1 Doctoral Attrition Rates \nDoctoral attrition, especially if it happens after several years, represents a significant cost to \nboth the student and the University.

In this context, the proposed new framework \nserves a dual-purpose vision: 1) to provide a rhythm for each academic \nyear that advances experiential learning opportunities for students, \nconnections between these opportunities and more traditional classroom \nwork, and pedagogical innovation by faculty; 2) to create a clearer niche \nfor Augustana and further differentiate the undergraduate student \nexperience at Augustana from alternatives on North Campus or at other \nAlberta universities. \nThe Impact of the Proposal is Apart from the above, the proposed Augustana Scheduling Initiative \ncould potentially address:  \n-student workload issues: particularly important for student mental \nhealth challenges that are increasingly recognized as critical;  \n-faculty workload issues: particularly the need to accommodate \nresearch expectations in a predominantly teaching Faculty;  \n-greater flexibility in degree completion times: especially with the \nopportunity to complete a *3 course in September or January;  \n-development of a first-year seminar: understood across North \nAmerica to be a “high-impact practice”, this mandatory “First Year \nExperience” course (proposed as AUIDS 101) will be a small seminar-\nstyle course for new students beginning studies at Augustana Faculty in \nthe September or January 3-weeks course period;  \n-provide opportunities for first and second-year students to \n‘sample’ courses: the 3-week course period means students commit \nless time to an interest that may or may not result in a change of major \nor minor, and give a ‘short-term’ opportunity to explore other subject \nareas;  \n-ability to accommodate students’ varying learning styles: this \ncomes with the flexibility to present different learning methods within a 3 \nor 11 week course, as well as potentially over two or more of these \ncomponents in the academic schedule;  \nReplaces/Revises (eg, policies, \nresolutions) \nUniversity Calendar 52.2, 52.3, 52.4, 55.4. \nTimeline/Implementation Date September 2017 \nEstimated Cost N/A \nSources of Funding Existing resources.

SHORT INFORMATON SUMMARY REGARDING '3-11' \nWhat Is It? \nOn May 4, 2015, the Augustana Faculty Council, after two years of study and with an overall \nmajority of 89%, passed the following motion: \n“THAT the Augustana Faculty implement, effective 2017-18, a new academic schedule with \nthe Fall and Winter semesters each consisting of a 3-week term followed by an 11-week \nterm and adopt a new timetable for the 11-week terms as outlined in Schedule A, and \ninvestigate the feasibility of an additional 3-week block term in the spring.” \nVision \nAs a residential, undergraduate, liberal arts and science faculty within the University of \nAlberta, the Augustana Campus places a special value on community-based education, \ninternational and outdoor educational experiences, undergraduate research and \nconnections to rural and aboriginal communities. In this context, the 3-11 framework \nserves a dual-purpose vision: 1) to provide a rhythm for each academic year that advances \nexperiential learning opportunities for students, connections between these opportunities \nand more traditional classroom work, and pedagogical innovation by faculty; 2) to create a \nclearer niche for Augustana and further differentiate the undergraduate student experience \nat Augustana from alternatives on North Campus or at other Alberta universities. \nBackground \nSeveral undergraduate universities (e.g., Quest University in Canada; Colorado College and \nCornell College in the U.S.) have organized the entire undergraduate experience on a block \ncalendar in which students take one course at a time and faculty only teach one course at a \ntime. Other universities have traditionally placed courses into 10-11 week quarters instead \nof 13-15 week semesters. Based on personal experiences that Augustana faculty members \nhave had with both systems and the visit of a delegation to Quest University, we have \ndecided on a hybrid approach that we believe offers significant advantages and flexibility. \nAdditional Benefits \nThe new academic calendar and timetable also offer opportunities to address: student \nworkload issues (particularly important for student mental health challenges that are \nincreasingly recognized as critical); faculty workload issues (particularly the need to \naccommodate research expectations in a predominantly teaching Faculty); the need for \nmore flexibility in degree completion times; the possibility of developing a first-year \nseminar, understood across North America to be a “high-impact practice;” the need to \nprovide opportunities for first and second-year students to ‘sample’ courses (i.e., to \ncommit less time to an interest that may or may not result in a change of major); the \nchallenge of how to accommodate students’ varying learning styles; and Augustana’s \nrelated goals of enrolment and revenue growth (the latter not only determined by the \nnumber of degree-seeking students but also by the number of community members who \nmay be interested in taking, and paying for, 3-week courses).  \n 3 \nOrganization of Implementation \nAugustana recognizes that implementation of these changes will require the support of \npartners within the central University of Alberta administration, including key personnel in \nthe Registrar’s Office and the Office of the Provost. Preliminary conversations with \nRegistrar Lisa Collins have helped identify the likely players. In addition, Augustana has \ncreated a 3-11 Task Force that includes representatives from all academic departments, \nstudent services and the Augustana Students’ Association. Leadership will be provided by \nVice Dean Anne-Marie Link and Associate Dean Academic Karsten Mündel. Other faculty \nand staff will be brought in as necessary to help work out specific details related to \nimplementation. Significant work will also be done within our three Department Councils. \nTimeline \nThe motion passed by the Augustana Faculty Council envisions two years for preparation, \nwith roll-out for the 2017/18 Academic Year. Most of the logistical, policy, and procedural \nwork of implementation must be completed by July 2016 for calendar and recruitment \nmaterials to accurately reflect the new Augustana realities. An important first task of \nimplementation, therefore, is collectively to work backwards from that date to establish the \ndeadlines for the various subtasks outlined below. \nKey Tasks \nThe work of implementation at this point falls into three overlapping categories. The \nfollowing list is presented as a starting point for our work with Central partners, \nrecognizing that other tasks will be added as a result of initial planning discussions.  \nNew Timetable \nAdoption of the 3-11 academic schedule requires us to adopt a new timetable for both the \n3-week and 11-week course periods. The timetable for 3-week courses will be relatively \neasy to implement, as traditional courses will be scheduled for approximately 3 hours per \nday with morning, afternoon and evening timeslots. The 11-week schedule ensures that \nthere will be the same number of instructional minutes in an 11-week term as in the \ncurrent 13-week term. \nNew Academic Schedule \n● setting up Campus Solutions to deal with the course schedule structure at \nAugustana \n● changes to relevant academic procedures and regulations in relation to the schedule \nand timetable changes (the group will need to create early on a full list of these \nprocedures and regulations) \nAugustana Tasks \nWe recognize that a series of Augustana-specific tasks need to take place in advance of the \n3-11 start date. These include: work on relevant promotional and recruitment materials; \ninvestments in faculty development; curriculum revisions; development of a First Year \nExperience seminar course for the first three-week course period as a pilot project.  \n 4 \nII.  BACKGROUND \nA Learning Experience Research Committee (LERC) was convened after the Augustana \nFaculty Council meeting of October 2013 to research and consider alternative learning \nexperience opportunities that might be implemented at Augustana Campus and to produce \na specific proposal for an alternative learning experience that reflects the values and \nculture of learning at Augustana. The point of producing a specific proposal was to facilitate \na substantive discussion in the Faculty.  Following this substantive discussion and \nconsultation [SEE BELOW], the proposal, which was to become known as '3-11' was \nsubsequently passed with an 89% majority at the Augustana Faculty Council meeting in \nMay 2015.   \nRationale for Proposal  \nA. The proposal was guided by the values and culture of learning articulated in The \nAugustana Faculty Academic Performance Measures (December 2012) and by the evaluation \nand recommendations of the Academic Unit Review of the Augustana Faculty (2011) since  \n(1) both reports have been accepted by the Augustana Faculty and University of Alberta  \n(2) the self-description of Augustana in The Augustana Faculty Academic Performance \nMeasures was a supplement to the Academic Measures for Budgeting Process 2013-14 \ndistributed by the Office of the Provost and as such is used to determine budget allocations \nto Augustana  \nB. This proposal aimed to strengthen the three characteristics that are unique to Augustana \n(according to The Augustana Faculty Academic Performance Measures):  \n(1) International Experiences  \n(2) Community-Based Learning  \n(3) Rural Connectedness  \nIn all three areas, the intention is to increase both the number of participating students and \nthe number of courses in each area.  \nC. The proposal also aimed to implement specific recommendations from the Academic Unit \nReview:  \n(1) to “push ahead confidently in making programming even more distinctive than is \nalready the case” by “strengthening and extending the core curriculum”;  \n(2) expand opportunities for “undergraduate research and creative work”;  \n(3) focus on “the liberal education provided to students regardless of major,” particularly \nwith regards to international experiences, community-based learning, and rural \nconnectedness.  \nD. The proposed learning experiences are high-impact practices that have all been tried \nand successfully implemented at one or more COPLAC institutions. This evidence suggests \nthat these practices could also work at Augustana if tailored to our specific situation. \nMoreover, the specific learning experiences in the proposal are constructed to meet current \nstudent needs (such as greater flexibility). \nThe \"3-11\" calendar was the major component of the resulting proposal, along with a First \nYear Experience. \n 5 \nThe objective of 3-11 is to provide students and faculty with more flexibility as well as to \nfacilitate unique experiential learning opportunities. Augustana could institute a 3 week course \nperiod at the beginning of the Fall and/or Winter term followed by an 11 week course period.  \nThese 3 and 11 week courses are accommodated within the existing Fall and Winter terms \nof the University of Alberta and do not change the number of contact hours, number of \ncourses taken by students over each term (normally 5) or number of courses taught by \nfaculty (normally 3).  \n 6 \nIII.  FACULTY CONSULTATION RE:  3-11 CALENDAR \nThe change to the 3-11 Calendar system formed the major part of the LERC proposal.   \nThe LERC committee consisted of representatives from all three academic departments and \nfrom the Augustana Students Association.  In the 2014-15 academic year it organized \ndiscussions regarding 3-11 at departmental meetings, at Faculty Council meetings and a series \nof formal consultations with faculty and staff.  The formal consultation dates are listed here: \n6 January          noon - 1:30         \n13 January       noon - 1:30          \n20 January       noon - 1:30 \n27 January       noon - 1:30  \n2 February      12:30 – 2:00              \n2 March            12:30 – 2:00              \n10 March          noon - 1:30          \n24 March          noon - 1:30            \n13 April            noon - 1:30  \nThere were between ten and twenty participants at the consultations outside Faculty \nCouncil meetings and departmental meetings. \nThe Faculty Council met in May 2015 to review, discuss and consider the material brought forth \nby the LERC committee and the results of its consultations.  The following motion was \nsubsequently put before the Faculty Council: \nTHAT the Augustana Faculty implement, effective 2017-18, a new academic \nschedule with the Fall and Winter semesters each consisting of a 3-\nweek term followed by an 11-week term and adopt a new timetable for \nthe 11-week terms as outlined in Schedule A, and investigate the \nfeasibility of an additional 3-week block term in the spring.  \nThe procedure for voting was that of a 'Super Majority', a decision-making procedure that had \nbeen voted on and carried at the December 1, 2014 meeting of the Faculty Council. This \nrequired that the motion for implementation of 3-11 needed to attain both a simple majority in \neach academic department followed by a two-thirds majority of YES votes at Faculty Council in \nwhich all members were to vote (faculty members, APOs, student representatives). \nThe majorities were achieved in all departments and an 89% YES vote was achieved at the \nFaculty Council meeting of May 2015. \nDuring that meeting, an Implementation Committee was constituted, which consists of \nrepresentatives from all academic departments, from the ASA, and from Residence \nLife/Student Services. \nConsultation continues as a major focus of the Implementation Committee. \n 7 \nIV.  FAQ \nStudent FAQ \n1) Why is Augustana doing this? \nAfter more than 2 years of consultation with students, faculty and staff, about \nways to improve the Augustana Advantage, we decided to implement a new \nacademic calendar and a First Year Experience. The new calendar will introduce \ngreater flexibility and foster the development of new experiential, travel and \nlearning opportunities. The First Year Experience will give students a seminar \nexperience in their first year to introduce them to learning in a Liberal Arts \ncontext. \n2) How does the new Augustana Academic Calendar work? \nThe Fall Term will consist of a 3-week course period in which students would take \n1 course followed by an 11-week course period in which students would take 4 \ncourses. The Winter Term would also have a 3-week course period and an \n11-week course period. There will be an increasing effort to also offer courses in a \nSpring 3-week course period. \n3) What is the implementation timeline? \nThe new academic calendar and First Year Experience will come into effect for the \n2017-18 academic year. The whole Augustana Campus will adopt the new \ncalendar. Students starting in the 2017-18 academic year will take the First Year \nSeminar class. \n4) Will I still be able to graduate in 4 years? \nAbsolutely! Students will still be able to take 5 courses in the Fall and Winter \nTerms and therefore be able to graduate in 4 years. As we increase our course \nofferings in the Spring and Summer Terms, students will also be able to pick up \nadditional courses to introduce greater flexibility into their schedules. \n5) What is the Augustana First Year Experience? \nThe Augustana First Year Experience is specifically designed to help students to \nmake the transition to university life and learning in a Liberal Arts context. There \nare two key components: a) the new student orientation and b) the Augustana \nFirst Year Seminar (FYS). The FYS will explore a specific topic in a small \nseminar-style setting. Students will be exposed to small-group discussion and will \nexplore a topic from a variety of academic disciplines and viewpoints. The new \nstudent orientation will work with the non-academic aspects of the transition to \nuniversity life. \n 8 \n6) What do I need to do to maintain full­time status in the new Augustana \nAcademic Calendar? \nFull-time status will continue to be a minimum of 9 credits per Term. Students have the \nflexibility to choose where in the Term to take their courses (for example, they could take \n3 credits in the 3-week course period and 6 credits in the 11-week course period). As is \ncurrently the case, specific scholarships and sponsorships may require a greater number \nof credits to maintain eligibility. In any case, the number of credits will be calculated at the \nTerm level (and not the block level). \n7) What kinds of 3­week courses will be offered in the fall and winter? \nThere will be a variety of courses offered in all 3-week course periods. These 3-week \ncourses will take advantage of the different time frame and the fact that students and \nprofessors are not involved in any other courses at the same time. \n8) Can I take September or January off? \nOne of the advantages of the new Academic Calendar is the choice it provides for \nscheduling. So, yes, you may be able to build an academic schedule that does not have any \nclasses in September or January for some of the Terms of your academic career at \nAugustana. However, depending on your major and other components of your academic \nprogram, it may be more challenging to complete your degree in 4 years if you take a \nbreak in September or January. \n9) Can I transfer my courses from Augustana to other universities? \nNone of the changes we are making to the academic schedule will impact the \ntransferability of these courses to other institutions. As at present, not all courses will \nalways transfer to a given program in a given receiving institution. Students are always \nadvised to check with a receiving institution about transferability. \n10) Are there any impacts on costs? \nNo. The costs for courses will continue to be calculated in the same manner as they are \nnow. Augustana will continue to follow the same fee assessment schedule as it currently \ndoes. Residence fees will continue to be assessed on a Term basis. \n11) Will my transcript look the same as it does now? \nYes. The transcripts will continue to look the same as they do now, listing courses by term \ntaken. \n 9 \nDo you have other questions? Please contact Sarah Ross in the Dean’s \nOffice  ross3@ualberta.ca and she will find you an answer (and include it here in the \nFAQ). \nStaff FAQ \n1. How does the new Augustana Academic Calendar work? \nThe Fall Term will consist of a 3-week course period in which students would take 1 \ncourse and an 11-week course period in which students would take 4 courses. The Winter \nTerm would also have a 3-week course period and 11-week course period. There will be \nan increasing effort to offer courses in a Spring 3-week course period. \n2. What is the implementation timeline? \nThe new academic calendar are First Year Experience will come into effect for the \n2017-18 academic year. The whole Augustana Campus will adopt the new calendar. \nStudents starting in the 2017-18 academic year will take the First Year Seminar class. \n3. How do I raise issues related to the impact of the new Academic Calendar on \nmy work?  \nThe first person to ask is your direct manager.  Additionally, Anne-Marie and Karsten are \nscheduling meetings with every unit on campus during the Fall Term. Those meetings will \nbe a further chance to ask questions about the impact of these changes on your work \nrhythms. \n4. How does full-time status work in the new Augustana Academic Calendar? \nFull-time status will continue to be 9 credits per Term. Students have the flexibility to \nchoose where in the Term to take their courses (for example, they could take one course in \nthe 3-week course period and 2 courses in the 11-week course period). As is currently the \ncase, specific scholarships and sponsorships may require a greater number of credits to \nmaintain eligibility. In any case, the number of credits will be calculated at the Term level \n(and not the period of weeks in which the course occurs). \nDo you have other questions?

The following programs are available \nwithin these departments: \nProgram Chart follows \n{…no changes required in this section…} \nNew 52.2 The Augustana Academic Course Schedule \nThe academic course schedule for Augustana Faculty \nprovides a unique rhythm for each academic year that \nadvances experiential learning opportunities for \nstudents, creates connections between these \nopportunities and more traditional classroom work, \noffers greater flexibility for students in managing \ncourse workloads and degree completion times, and \nprovides greater accommodation to a variety of student \nlearning styles. \nAugustana Faculty features an academic schedule in \nwhich each of the traditional Fall and Winter Terms \nconsist of students taking a single course for 3 weeks, \nfollowed by a number of courses for 11 weeks.  There \nare a smaller number of additional 3-week courses \navailable at the start of the standard University Spring \nTerm.  This schedule creates a potential annual student \nacademic enrollment cycle of 3-11-3-11-3. Students \ntypically register in a single *3 course in the 3-week \nperiod and a combination of courses totalling *12 \nduring the 11-week period. \n52.2      The Augustana Core \n{…no further changes in this section…} \n52.3     The Augustana Core \n{…no further changes in this section…} \n52.3 General Program Information \n The following terms, definitions, and \nabbreviations are used throughout the Augustana \nFaculty section of the Calendar. \n(1)  Unit of Course Weight: A unit of course weight \nindicates the instructional credit assigned to a course \nand is designated by the symbol after the course \nnumber and name.

These values are drawn from the principles on \nwhich the University of Alberta was founded in 1908 and reflect a dynamic, modern institution of \nhigher learning, leading change nationally and internationally.\nAbove all, we value intellectual integrity, freedom of inquiry and expression, and the equality \nand dignity of all persons as the foundation of ethical conduct in research, teaching, learning, \nand service.\nWe value excellence in teaching, research, and creative activity that enriches learning \nexperiences, advances knowledge, inspires engaged citizenship, and promotes the public good.\nWe value learners at all stages of life and strive to provide an intellectually rewarding educational \nenvironment for all.\nWe value academic freedom and institutional autonomy as fundamental to open inquiry and the \npursuit of truth.\nWe value diversity, inclusivity, and equity across and among our people, campuses, and \ndisciplines.\nWe value creativity and innovation from the genesis of ideas through to the dissemination of \nknowledge.\nWe value history and tradition, celebrating the contributions of students, alumni, faculty, staff, \nvolunteers, Indigenous peoples, and other groups, which bring pride to the university.\n4\nU N I V E R S I T Y  O F  A L B E R T A\nAt the University of Alberta, we begin with people—people with ideas, \ntalent, and purpose. Then, we act.\nWe seek knowledge. We educate citizens. We ask the big questions. We push the limits of \nhuman understanding and knowledge. We engage with partners and communities close to home \nand around the world to lead positive change. We empower creative people to take risks and \nexperiment.\nWhy? The answer is simple: We are a public university acting for the public good.\nWhen we act, we provide meaningful educational experiences, promote innovative thinking, \nand develop compelling and relevant solutions that matter. When we lead, we tackle the most \nimportant local, national, and global challenges. When we excel, our work sparks and feeds \nwidespread social, cultural, and economic benefits for others—indeed for the uplifting of the \nwhole people.\nIn For the Public Good—our institutional strategic plan for the coming decade—we embrace and \naffirm our vision to inspire the human spirit through outstanding achievements in learning, \ndiscovery, and citizenship in a creative community, building one of the world’s great universities \nfor the public good.\nWe forge ahead, motivated and supported by the University of Alberta’s 108-year history of \nleadership, achievement, and public service.

In 1908, founding president Henry Marshall \nTory reminded Albertans that “the modern state university has sprung from a demand on the \npart of the people themselves” and promised “that knowledge shall not be the concern of \nscholars alone.  The uplifting of the whole people shall be its final goal.” He challenged future \ngenerations not to forget this ultimate goal. It has not been forgotten. We continue to seek \nmutually beneficial, reciprocal connections and collaborations with partners throughout the \nglobal academy, local communities, First Nations, industry, business, and government. We \nengage with diverse partners to conduct and translate learning and research into evidence-\nbased public policy, improved industrial practices, changed attitudes, and healthier, more \ncompassionate communities.
