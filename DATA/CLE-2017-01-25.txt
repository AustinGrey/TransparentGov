This tool can be used by instructors to create course syllabi that meet University of Alberta course outline policy. The tool also creates an electronic database of course information that can be used by faculties to run various types of curriculum mapping reports. The demonstration is meant to gauge interest from Faculties to begin to use the tool to manage syllabi creation and perform mapping. Support for further development will be discussed. Dr Cor reported on a pilot project in the Faculty of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Science, an outcome of a Teaching and Learning Enhancement Fund (TLEF) award to Drs. Cheryl Sadowski, Sharla King and Ken Cor. He noted that the project involved the development of a tool to facilitate curriculum mapping that aligned with assessments and teaching strategies and also provided a syllabus creation tool. Dr Cor provided a comprehensive demonstration and noted that the tool could be tailored to meet the individual needs of a Faculty. The value of the tool for program evaluation and accreditation purposes was noted. During the discussion, members raised various questions and issues including: whether students would be able to search through the database; whether a French language version was available; challenges in ensuring consistency on items such as learning outcomes between individual users; potential use as part of a new professor orientation. It was noted that the tool would be usefully administratively to ensure that course syllabi were consistent and complete across a Faculty. Further information will come to the committee at a later date after discussions with the Provost’s Office, IST, and interested Faculties.",

The information collected through the survey will provide evidence to inform CTL initiatives and programming in order to better serve the needs of faculty. Discussion: Dr Miller-Young presented an overview of the proposed project which would provide a focus for CTL for a period of time. She reported on discussions with the Taylor Institute for Teaching and Learning at the University of Calgary regarding the potential of combining data to add to the literature on disciplinary differences. During the discussion, Dr Miller-Young confirmed that the survey would include contract staff, and students on items related to the learning environment. Members expressed caution about: a collaboration with Calgary noting differences in institutional cultures; the risk of low response rates normally seen with email surveys; and the length of time required for participants to complete the survey. Suggestions included asking questions on: to include method of delivery such as flipped classrooms and blended learning; how instructors obtain feedback and howe useful it is; how safe do instructors feel in implementing innovations in practice. Other suggestions included: providing the survey in French; clearly defining what the data will be used for and why participants should take part in the survey.",

Mr. Rahman led a small CLE subcommittee that provided advice on the preparation of a report summarizing its discussions, review of existing evidence and its likely consequences (excluding financial implications) for teaching and learning environment at the institution. Further to the discussion on November 2, 2016 at CLE, additional information was added comparing teaching streams at eight other Canadian institutions based on publicly available information (mostly institutional policies, collective bargaining agreements, data reported in institutional planning and analysis, and in rare cases media communication). These institutions represent a cross-section of Canadian post-secondary institutions of different size, research ability, and membership in U15 and are spread across Canada (Alberta, British Columbia, Manitoba, Ontario, and Nova Scotia). Discussion: Mr Rahman provided an overview of the additional information provided based on the committee’s feedback in November. Committee members noted the value in having instructors who can explain complicated things well. Caution was expressed by the committee on differentiating streams of faculty members and the risk of the streams being viewed unequally. Comments included: career mobility, variability in lifespan of a professor, what is the merit of doing this, teaching not given the strategic significance of research, what are the expectations around scholarly activity, how to compete with research grants, what is the goal of having a differentiated stream, how does this relate to the current FSO model. The committee advised that the report should define a position and address the open ended questions. The committee also reiterated the recognition of equality between the two streams was very important.",

By doing so, we hope to establish baseline measures of teaching practices, \nattitudes, and scholarly engagement, and to better understand local cultures of teaching and the \nconditions under which new, evidence-based approaches to teaching are adopted. \nThe information collected through the survey will provide evidence to inform CTL initiatives \nand programming in order to better serve the needs of faculty. CTL will hold information \nsessions to share results of the survey with the University community, post a summary of results \non its website, and, if desired, share in a report to CLE and the Provost’s Office.  \nThe survey is being co-developed with the Taylor Institute for Teaching and Learning at the \nUniversity of Calgary where an equivalent study will be conducted.  By aggregating our data, the \nstudies will have a greater potential to also contribute to the literature related to supporting \nteaching and teaching cultures in higher education.  For the purposes of research dissemination, \nthe UofA data will be aggregated with the equivalent data set collected from the University of \nCalgary, so that responses of individuals and their department, Faculty, and institution will be \nkept strictly confidential. \nEthics clearance will be sought and survey participation will be completely voluntary.   \nSurvey Development \nA number of surveys are available (below) which we will draw from in order to develop our \nown.  We intend to develop a survey that takes no more than 20 minutes for participants to \ncomplete.  We will ask questions about: \nCurrent Practices (e.g. time spent on different instructional preparation activities, expectations \nfor students’ out-of-class preparations, assessment methods, experiential learning opportunities, \ninvolvement in inquiry and discussions about teaching); faculty will be asked to what extent they \nagree with statements such as: \n● I encourage students to respond to questions posed by other students. \n● I provide opportunities for students to reflect on their own learning (e.g. reflective blogs, learning \nportfolios, etc.). \n● I have worked with colleagues at my institution in framing and investigating questions about \nteaching and learning. \n● I often make a deliberate effort to share my teaching and learning experience with others. \nCurrent Attitudes, Beliefs and Approaches (e.g. attitudes and conceptions about good teaching \nand meaningful learning in the disciplines, use of reflection on and inquiry into teaching and \nlearning, frequency of conversations/dissemination about teaching with colleagues within \ndept/Faculty/institution/discipline, facilitation of constructive interaction among students, \nengagement with literature on teaching); faculty will be asked to what extent they agree with \nstatements such as: \n● Teaching in this subject should help students question their own understanding of the subject \nmatter. \n● A lot of teaching time in this subject should be used to question students’ ideas. \n● Interactive learning techniques are very helpful in teaching effectively \n● An instructor has been successful if students retain the important concepts of the class for the \nlong-term \nAnd to complete short answer questions such as: \n● Good teaching is…. \n● Effective learning is…. \nFactors helping and inhibiting participants’ success in teaching effectively (e.g. what do faculty \ncurrently do with their teaching time, how much time do they spend, what they need in order to \nteach well; the extent to which various existing sources of support are important to them); faculty \nwill be asked to what extent they agree with statements such as: \n● I am provided with adequate incentives and rewards to be a good teacher \n● I am provided with enough training and education on how to be an effective teacher \n● The training and education I receive on effective teaching at my institution is a worthwhile use of \nmy time \n● Information on effective teaching methods and tools is regularly provided to me by my \ncolleagues, department, and/or college \nQuestions for the committee: \n● Are there general themes that are missing that might be added? \n● How might we best administer the survey for clarity of purpose and a high response rate? \n● How could CLE assist with communication and dissemination about the survey and its \nfindings?    \nYour assistance in this project is greatly appreciated.  \nReferences \nAbbas, A., Abbas, J., Brayman, K., Brennan, J., & Gantogtokh, O.

While there are some similarities between the Canadian system and \nthe American one, it is safe to say that the American system is more stratified and strained than \nthe Canadian one. Therefore, particularly when looking at teaching outcomes, many of the \napparent downsides of hiring teaching-only stream faculty may actually be attributable to \nsystemic chronic-underfunding, rather than shortcomings of the individuals in these positions. \nFor instance, one study mentions that teaching-only faculty are less likely to have office hours on \ncampus, but then recounts a story about an instructor converting a utility closet to an office.1 \nCanadian universities are – generally speaking – facing less severe challenges and the issues that \nappear to plague American contingent instructors would likely be rather foreign to their \nCanadian counterparts.  \nAdditionally, there is lack of available longitudinal data on how student outcomes have changed \nbefore and after the establishment of teaching-stream. This makes conclusively proving that \nteaching-stream improves student outcomes challenging. However, there is a strong inductive \nargument that the introduction of tenure, with its benefits of job security and the potential for \npedagogical research, will have a positive impact on student outcomes. \nArguments against Teaching Stream: \nThere are a number of issues that arise when looking at the workability of implementing a \nteaching stream. Some of which are valuable questions to ask, while other others seem to flow \nfrom a philosophical aversion to teaching-intensive positions. A major challenge is, of course, \nhow to develop and implement a teaching-intensive tenure stream, and whether or not that \nstream should be fully integrated within the traditional tenure system, or rather if it should \nsomehow operate in a separate, yet parallel space. A Council of Ontario Universities (COU) \nreport argues that as long as teaching is valued, rightly or wrongly, less than research, integrating \nthese teaching-intensive roles into the standard tenure system will only perpetuate the bias \nagainst those focused primarily on teaching.2 While this concern appears somewhat valid, as this \nissue frequently comes up in interviews with teaching stream faculty, it is likely that \n1 Adrianna Kezar, “Examining Non-Tenure Track Faculty Perceptions of How Departmental Policies and Practices Shape Their \nPerformance and Ability to Create Student Learning at Four-Year Institutions,” Research in Higher Education 54, no. 5 (2013): \n587. \n2 Leslie Sanders, Teaching Stream Positions: Some Implications (Toronto, 2011). \n  2 \nnormalization of teaching-stream faculty, and the likely persistent salary differentiation should \nserve to partially ameliorate this problem.3  \nThe COU also implies that, somehow, a focus on teaching may erode the “robust culture of \ninquiry in undergraduate education” that should be present on campus.4 Of the many objections \nraised by those who oppose the introduction of teaching stream stream faculty, this one is \nperhaps the most problematic and persistent. Traditional discourses on the role and structure of \nthe university tend to assume a high degree of complementarity between research and teaching, \nand on many levels, this relationship appears natural and rational.5 However, the data on \nundergraduate education quality presents a more complicated picture. The majority of literature \nsuggests that there is no relationship between quality of research and quality of teaching, and \nfurther that both teaching and research intensive faculty are adequately equipped to provide \nstudents with both a broad base of knowledge and specific insights into their field.6The evolution \nand rising importance of research productivity at universities has created an incentive structure \nsuch that for academics employed in ‘traditional’ roles, research tends to take precedence over \nteaching and pedagogical research. The introduction of a teaching stream should help mediate \nthese competing interests, and create ‘space’ within a department for the furthering of teaching \nmethods (including scholarship of teaching) without negatively impacting the research \nproductivity of research-focused professors. Further, a more accurate predictor of student \nlearning outcomes seems to be an individual’s employment of certain teaching strategies – \nstrategies that are not, by any means, accessible only to research-focused academics.7  \nThere is also the issue of the overall research quality and prestige of an institution, as both are at \npotentially at risk if the professoriate becomes dominated by individuals not actively engaged in \ntraditional research. While this concern may be valid, there is no real way of addressing it \nwithout getting into a larger discussion about the root cause of this issue, university funding. If \nan institution is being faced with stagnant or shrinking budgets, while also facing growing \nenrollment, there is no way out of that predicament that does not involve making painful choices. \nFurther, it is unlikely that any major Canadian research institution (particularly U15) is intent on \ndecimating the number of research-focused academics at their school, so the concern about the \nerosion of prestige seems to be more of a straw man than a substantive concern.  \nThe majority of arguments offered against the creation of teaching stream position are offered by \ntwo specific subsets of the academic community. One group is the already privileged set of \nindividuals who have the benefit of tenure and therefore need not be particularly concerned about \n3 Susan Vajoczki et al., “Teaching-Stream Faculty in Ontario Universities The Higher Education Quality Council of Ontario” \n(2011): 36–37. \n4 Sanders, Teaching Stream Positions: Some Implications, 6. \n5 Ruth Neumann, “Perceptions of the Teaching-Research Nexus: A Framework for Analysis,” Higher Education 23, no. 2 (1992): \n159–171. \n6 J.

Wawrzynski, “Contingent Faculty as Teachers: What We Know; What We Need to Know,” American \nBehavioral Scientist 55, no. 11 (2011): 1501. \n  3 \ntheir job security, or ability to earn a stable, fair income.8 The other group are those who are \npresently employed in teaching-intensive roles but who would prefer to be employed in a more \n‘traditional’, i.e. research-intensive position.9 For them, they see the codification and \nformalization of teaching stream as detrimental, as these roles, viewed by some young academics \nas transitory, will increasingly become institutionalized and permanent. Both of these objections \nare problematic, as each group seems to presuppose that every individual within the academic \ncommunity has, or ought to have, ambitions to carry out intensive research. Obviously, this is not \nthe case, and there a number of instructors at other universities who have spoken to the fact that \nthey prefer and also enjoy teaching. In some cases, the creation of secure, teaching-intensive \npositions has even drawn professors from other universities, eager to extricate themselves from \nthe “publish-or-die” attitude of more traditional faculty appointments.10 Even for individuals \n‘stuck’ teaching, who would prefer to be employed in a position that involved a greater degree of \nresearch, the introduction of job security and retention incentives is most likely preferable to the \ntumultuous status-quo of being sessional or contract instructors.  \nThere is some literature that suggests that part-time instructors may negatively impact student \nlearning outcomes and retention.11 This concern comes from speculation that part-time faculty \nare less likely than their full-time, tenured colleagues to understand the campus culture, be \nfamiliar with services to support student success and be less willing to engage with students \noutside the classroom. If this is the case, and that in and of itself is questionable, it strengthens \nthe argument for the adoption of teaching-stream tenure positions, or other means of providing \njob security and a sense of belonging to contract faculty, as the provision of these benefits will \nlikely increase their connection to the institution and their investment in better understanding the \ncampus and associated services. A large body of research, which holds that job security and job \nperformance are positively correlated, supports this conclusion.12  A renewed incentive structure \nand reduced uncertainty makes these sort of productivity-enhancing investments worthwhile for \nthe affected instructors. A study of the impact of instructor status on teaching quality at a large \nCanadian university found that “there is not a strong correlation between research-focused and \nteaching-focused college instructors – both have effective and noneffective teachers within each \ngroup…instructors do not make a large difference to student achievement”.13 These findings \n8 For example, see: Sanders, Teaching Stream Positions: Some Implications. \n9 Lee Bessette, “The Teaching Track?

February (2009): 92. \n  4 \nsuggest that stated concern about teaching-intensive faculty eroding the quality of education is \nvastly overstated. In fact, there is some evidence that suggests teaching-intensive faculty can \nactually have a positive impact on the quality of education at the undergraduate level.  \nArguments for Teaching Stream: \nThere are a number of strong practical, as well as philosophical arguments for the adoption of \nsome form of teaching stream at the University of Alberta. Much of the recent scholarship on \nteaching quality has consistently found that there is either no difference in educational quality \nbetween tenured and contract instructors or, in some cases, that these non-tenured teachers \nactually improve student success and engagement. A study conducted at Northwestern \nUniversity found a statistically significant increase in both students’ grades and the likelihood of \nthem taking another class in a field if they took a class taught by an instructor rather than a \ntenure-track professor.14 While instructors at Northwestern do not have the benefit of formal \nteaching stream, Northwestern has pursued a policy of nurturing long-term, secure relationships \nwith their instructors. These are individuals “with benefits, career ladders and job security”– \nsomething which could be considered roughly, albeit imperfectly, analogous to tenure.15  \nAnother study that looked nationally at teaching methods in the United States found that full-\ntime faculty, regardless of whether or not they were tenured, were more likely than their part-\ntime counterparts to employ both learning (essays, presentations and peer assessment) and \nsubject (multiple choice exams, short answer exams) centered approaches to teaching, while \npart-time faculty was heavily reliant on only subject-centered evaluations.16 This finding led the \nresearchers to conclude that the most effective allocation of a university’s funds was to focus on \nensuring that contingent instructors were offered full-time positions, as by virtue of being full-\ntime, they were more likely to employ a broad, and constructive, array of evaluative methods.17It \nis worth noting here that there was no difference in the methods of research vs. teaching \nintensive faculty, suggesting that the nature of employment matters more than the individual’s \nfocus.  \nThere is a notable lack of research into the impact of teaching only or contingent faculty on \nlearning outcomes in Canada. The only econometrically sound study of instructor status and \nperceived educational quality was the aforementioned one which found no statistically-\n14 David Figlio, Morton Schapiro, and Kevin Soter, Are Tenure Track Professors Better Teachers?, NBER Working Paper Series \n(Cambridge, MA, 2013), http://www.nber.org/papers/w19406. \n15 Ibid., 9.David Figlio, “Sunday Dialogue: Academia’s Two Tracks,” The New York Times, 2013, \nhttp://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/17/opinion/sunday/sunday-dialogue-academias-two-tracks.html?_r=0. \n16 Baldwin and Wawrzynski, “Contingent Faculty as Teachers: What We Know; What We Need to Know,” 1494. \n17 Ibid., 1505. \n  5 \nsignificant relationship; however the authors did find that teaching-focused instructors received a \nnominally higher score when being assessed on perceived teaching effectiveness.18  \nTeaching Tenure – Policies and Protections  \nAmerican Examples:  \n• The American Association of University Professors (AAUP) has an appendix in a major \nreport on teaching stream initiatives which highlights the approaches that different US \nschools to instituting policies around this new category. Many of the schools listed are \npublically funded, and are therefore reasonable comparators. Most notably, the \nPennsylvania State University system has instituted a formal teacher tenure track, while \nthe University of California system has implemented a system wherein there is no formal \ntenure, but instructors are granted longer-term contracts and more equitable salaries and \nbenefits.  \n• Appendix can be found here: http://www.aaup.org/report/tenure-and-teaching-intensive-\nappointments  \nCanadian Examples:  \n• University of Manitoba: According to a cursory review of the 2010-2013 Collective \nBargaining Agreement it appears as though the university’s teaching-intensive positions \n(Instructor/Lecturer designation) are afforded the same benefits as traditional faculty, \nincluding the ability to accrue research leave and longer-term contracts. Their salaries, \nhowever, are prorated.  \n• University of Toronto – Lecturer and Senior Lecturer, permanent appointments  \n• York: Alternate-Stream Appointment  \n• Waterloo: Continuing Lecturer \n• Dalhousie, McMaster, UBC, SFU and the University of Regina all also have similar \nagreements in place with their instructors and contingent faculty. \nSecuring Institutional and Strategic Commitment  \nWhile the aforementioned schools appear to have created these new positions without excessive \npushback from faculty, there have been some exceptions, where existing faculty associations \nhave strongly pushed back against the creation of teaching stream stream positions – most \nnotably at the University of Ottawa and University of Windsor.19 While there is little information \navailable on the specific issues that faculty at these institutions raised, it is reasonable to assume \nthat they were similar to the general arguments against teaching tenure outlined above. If the \nUniversity of Alberta were to move forward on this issue, it would be critical to more closely \nexamine the processes that were used with success at York University, the University of Toronto \n18 Hoffmann and Oreopoulos, “Professor Qualities and Student Achievement,” 88. \n19 Farr, “For Teaching-Only Faculty, a Controversial Role.” \nhttp://www.aaup.org/report/tenure-and-teaching-intensive-appointments\nhttp://www.aaup.org/report/tenure-and-teaching-intensive-appointments\nhttps://www.google.ca/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&ved=0CBwQFjAAahUKEwiRkbnfx5rIAhUQRYgKHczcBLc&url=http%3A%2F%2Fumanitoba.ca%2Fadmin%2Fhuman_resources%2Fservices%2Fmedia%2FFinal_version_2010_2013_UMFA_Collective_Agreement.doc&usg=AFQjCNFH7hg6lZoYlenuTYS7U_tj_3SEJg&bvm=bv.103388427,d.cGU&cad=rja\n  6 \nand UBC. It would also be helpful to initiate conversations with the Students’ Unions at these \ninstitutions to determine how, if at all, they were included in these discussions.  \nThe Delphi Project on Changing Faculty and Student Success, located the University of \nSouthern California, has developed a number of resources designed at facilitating discussions \naround the role and status of teaching-intensive faculty members.20 This includes tracking the \npaths of successful attempts to address and change the role of these instructors on a number of \ncampuses in the United States. There are, however, no similar studies of Canadian institutions \nthat are readily available.  \nWorks Cited  \nBaldwin, R. G., and M. R.

Background \nExploring Teaching Tenure Stream at University of Alberta \nIn response to growing enrollment and shrinking per-student funding, universities are forced to be more \ncreative in how they allocate resources. A common response across North America has been the rapid \nexpansion of contract teaching positions, as opposed to the traditional research-teaching-service model \nof tenured positions. Individuals in these contract positions generally lack the job security, \ncompensation and benefits of their tenured or tenure-track counterparts. In 2014-15, there were 922 \ncontract academics at our institution; as the number of contract instructors continues to grow, failure to \naddress this issue creates a liability for the institution.  \nSome North American universities, including the University of Toronto, UBC, Waterloo and the \nPennsylvania State University system have recognized that contract staff represent a tremendous asset \nto the academy and have implemented programs alike tenure to assure these individuals job security, \nfair compensation and the ability to conduct research – usually on discipline-specific pedagogy. \nDepartments tend to employ these individuals to teach junior courses, reserving more advanced classes \nfor “traditional” academics.   \nThe disproportionate presence of contract faculty in introductory classes raises important questions \nabout the relationship between their precarious status and student learning outcomes. With respect to \nstudent learning, there are two distinct issues: the innate ability of contract staff to teach at the same \nlevel as their research-focused colleagues, and the institutional support lent to contract faculty to \nensure they are able to engage with and support their students. The majority of available data on \nstudent learning outcomes under the two classes of instructors suggests that there is no statistically \nsignificant difference in learning outcomes, and in some cases contract instructors may affect \nimprovement in students’ performance in later classes in the same discipline.  Hence, creating \npermanent, secure positions for these instructors would not be detrimental, and may actually have \nbenefits for students. Additionally, the creation of these new, secure appointments would allow \ninstructors to dedicate more time to students and become more deeply invested in the university. \nStudies suggest that where shortcomings have been identified with contract instructors, they tend to be \nattributable to structural factors (lack of office space, insufficient time to prepare for courses, rushed \nevaluative measures) rather than instructor inability.  Taken together, the creation of teaching-tenure \npositions is likely to have a positive impact on student engagement and student learning outcomes.  \nWhile the mechanics of a teaching-tenure system remain unclear, and obtaining broad institutional buy-\nin will be critical to any initiative, the issue warrants further deliberation and study. The University of \nAlberta must demonstrate leadership on this issue to help ensure that the stock of teaching-focused \nfaculty remains stable and that students are able to continue to access high-quality education. \n2 \nThe Students' Union VPA proposes that CLE establishes a sub-committee to operate from March - \nOctober 2016 that will explore the opportunities and challenges of establishing a teaching tenure stream \nat the University of Alberta. \n2. Committee Mandate \nThe mandate of the CLE Subcommittee is to explore the opportunities and challenges for creating a \nteaching tenure stream at University of Alberta with the goal to enhance quality instruction and learning \nenvironment for undergraduate students. To fulfill this mandate the committee will consider \nundertaking the following activities: \ni. Consider the ways creation of teaching tenure stream (potentially accompanied by \ncontinuing appointments and job stability, greater professional development opportunities, \nincreased scholarship of teaching and learning, increased support and resources from home \ndepartment and faculty) will potentially affect the learning environment and quality of \ninstruction available to undergraduate students at University of Alberta. \nii. Review teaching tenure stream practices and arrangements at other Canadian peer \ninstitutions and research available literature on the issue in Canadian post-secondary \nlandscape (and if need be, at equivalent American public post-secondary context). \niii. Collect comprehensive statistics on total number of undergraduate courses and sections \ntaught by instructors who are not appointed as tenure track /tenured/ full time academic \nstaff/non-industry experts, by department / programs and faculties at University of Alberta. \niv. Consult key stakeholders on consequences of creating teaching tenure stream at University \nof Alberta on teaching and learning environment for undergraduate students and the \nopportunities and barriers to establishing a teaching tenure stream at University of Alberta. \nThis can include but is not limited to members of Dean’s Council, Chair’s Council or \nUndergraduate Chair’s Council, Students’ Union, GSA, Academic Staff Association of \nUniversity of Alberta (including representatives of Contract Academic Staff Association and \nSessional and Other Temporary Staff, members of AASUA Teaching and Learning \nCommittee) and former members (co-chairs) of Renaissance Committee. \nv. Survey and solicit aggregated feedback from members of university community on their \nviews on teaching tenure stream, with a caveat that it is only in exploratory stages.   \n3. Committee Composition \n• One representative of the Graduate Students’ Association \n• One representative of the Students’ Union \n• One representative of the Provost’s office \n• One representative of Department Chairs \n• One representative of Academic Staff \n• One representative of the Association of Academic Staff University of Alberta (external to \nCLE) \n3 \n• The Director (or delegate) of the Centre for Teaching and Learning  \n4. Committee Meetings and Timeline \n• The subcommittee will meet bi-weekly between March 2016 and October 2016. \n• A draft report for discussion will be presented at the October 2016 CLE meeting. \n5. Committee Support \nThe Office of Vice-President (Academic), Students’ Union; Office of Vice-Provost (Learning Initiatives) \nwill provide administrative support. \n6.
