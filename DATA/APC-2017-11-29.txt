            "Description": "Purpose of the Proposal: To discuss the reports of the five faculties who conducted QA reviews of their undergraduate and graduate programs as well as President’s Visiting Committees in 2017: Extension, Rehabilitation Medicine, Law, ALES and the School of Public Health. Discussion: The Chair provided an overview of the quality assurance (QA) process at the university adding that it is mandated by government and subject to audit by the Campus Alberta Quality Council (CAQC). He further noted that the President’s Visiting Committees (PVC) is an internal university process which is Faculty-based, forward- looking, strategic and includes research. Dr Rodgers reported that the QA process had been revised prior to this round of reviews to be more efficient and streamlined. She noted that the excerpted reports presented to APC had been reviewed and commented on by the Faculty prior to being finalized. Dr Rodgers indicated that the QA review committees included internal members of the university, external members from Canadian institutions, and external members from international institutions particularly for the PVC portions. She further noted that there were opportunities for participation on review committees and encouraged committee members to contact her if they were interested in serving in this capacity. During the ensuing discussion, members expressed a number of questions in relation to the objectives of the QA reviews, recognition of system-wide issues, identification of common themes, whether there was any potential impact to tuition fees, monitoring of implementation of commitments by Faculties, how the QA process aligns with the accreditation process conducted by some programs/Faculties, and APC’s role in identifying how academic programming at the university responds to the identified goals within the QA reports. Dr Rodgers indicated that issues identified during the QA process are monitored through regular meetings between the Provost and the deans, and that the Provost works with each Faculty to determine how accreditation activities can inform the QA process so duplication and effort is minimized. Members discussed findings within the reports of the Faculty of ALES, the Faculty of Law, the Faculty of Extension, and involvement of the Faculty of Graduate Studies and Research, the Office of Advancement, and Alumni Council. Members engaged in discussion on Faculty-led activities in response to the Truth and Reconciliation Commission Calls to Action, as well as activities related to increasing equity, diversity and inclusivity. The Chair noted that the university would be responding to changes in the Provincial labour legislation recognizing post-doctoral fellows as employees.",

The outcomes of the \nFaculty’s teaching and research are consistent with the University’s commitment to excellence \nand engagement.  \nThe reviews found the faculty members to be fully engaged in teaching, community service, and \nscholarly activities. The resourcing, administrative structure, and support services available \nappear adequate and consistent with what one would expect to find within a nationally ranked \nCanadian research university.   \nThe MACT is a successful program with potential for growth. Students appreciate the depth of \nunderstanding provided by theoretically oriented courses and note this is a differentiator \ncompared to other professional master’s. It is well positioned and supported with opportunities \nfor growth if resources could be made available. In particular, the program fees could be raised \nmodestly, not only to help pay for additional faculty resources, but also as a recognition of the \nquality of the program. \nLast Updated November 17, 2017       Page 2 of 7 \nOFFICE OF THE PROVOST AND VICE-PRESIDENT (ACADEMIC)  \nGraduate Program Review \nPrograms \nReviewed \n● Master of Arts in Communication and Technology \nReview Dates February 27-28, 2017 \nReviewers ● Dr. Richard Smith, (Committee Chair), Professor, School of \nCommunication, Simon Fraser University; \n● Dr. Maria Bakardjieva, Professor, Department of Communication, \nMedia and Film, University of Calgary; \n● Dr. Carrie Smith-Prei, Department Chair, Modern Languages and \nCultural Studies, University of Alberta; \n● Dr. Lynn McGarvey, Vice-Dean, Faculty of Education, University of \nAlberta \nOutcome \nThe Graduate Program Review Committee (GPRC) found the MACT to have a high level of \nquality and by indicators provided. The review found the program is underpriced, and therefore \nunderappreciated. The MACT program, while relatively new, is known within the media, \nprofessional communications, and public relations industry in Alberta and is gaining wider \nrecognition. The program’s graduate student conference, organized with University of Calgary \nstudents each winter, is especially well-known. The program is succeeding in a difficult space - \nonline education - through hard work and continuous improvement of content and tools. \nAlthough the MACT is a professional program, the curriculum is a blend of research foundations \nand the courses on the needs of industry, public administration and civil society.  \nProgram Strengths \n● The Faculty of Extension has a detailed and comprehensive strategic plan, and the \nMACT program fits well with it's the values and objectives.  \n● The program has considerable interaction with the local, national, and international \nprofessional bodies (e.g., IABC, PR Association of Canada) as well as strong alumni \nconnections. Thanks to these linkages, the curricula and learning environment meet \ndisciplinary and institutional standards.  \n● The MACT curriculum is kept relevant through regular updates in the context of \ntechnological changes (e.g. social media, mobile media) and the evolving the needs of \nstudents (for example, reducing the knowledge management focus).  \n● The combination of a three week “intensive” coupled with longer online courses sees \nhigh satisfaction by students, excellent retention and graduation rates, and other \nimportant outcomes including advanced study.   \n● The program policies and procedures are clearly written and well understood by \nLast Updated November 17, 2017       Page 3 of 7 \nOFFICE OF THE PROVOST AND VICE-PRESIDENT (ACADEMIC)  \nstudents. \n● The program attracts high quality students who show strong retention and completion \nrates.  \n● There is considerable community engagement through the capstone projects and course \nwork. Notable community partners include the City of Edmonton, the Alberta Treasury \nBranch, and other non-profit groups in the city and region. \n● The program uses space efficiently as the students are mainly online and schedules \nhave them present on campus during “quiet” times of the year. The newly renovated \nFaculty of Extension building is a state-of-the-art educational facility capable of meeting \ndiverse student needs.  \n Opportunities for Program Improvement and Enhancement \nThe committee made several recommendations: \n● The GPRC noted that MACT could benefit from performance indicators linked to the \nFaculty’s strategic goals. For example, a method to track and improve mentoring \npractice could be explored. \n● The committee felt that the MACT was underpriced and acknowledged the constraints \nthe University is under with regards to tuition. They advise that underpriced tuition can \ncall into question the quality of the program, especially to international students. The \nGPRC recommends raising fees and investing in both scholarships (to maintain access) \nand faculty and research that would enhance quality in the long run. \n● The committee recommended that strategies for alumni engagement continue to be \nexplored. \n● The committee observed that while faculty access UAlberta professional development \nresources, there seems to be a lack of training specific to supervising in a professional \nprogram. The Committee recommends coordinating with other professional schools to \nshare best practice and resources. \n● The GPRC recommends exploring new modes of delivery (mobile delivery, high \ndefinition video, virtual reality, etc.) as these become more available and affordable. \nGiven the focus of the program, experimentation and adoption of these new \ntechnologies could be approached as a research project and as a unique direction of \nprofessional development that can be carried over into the student's workplace and civic \nactivities.” \n● The Committee noted that all of the core faculty are male, and recommend that hiring \nmore full-time female faculty members should be a priority.  \n● The GPRC found no clear guidelines around the structure of the capstone project and \nthe thesis. They recommend clarifying requirements as a well as mechanism for checks \nand balance to improve the student experience.  \n● The Committee supports the Program’s plans to introduce a Post-baccalaureate \ncertificate program based on the courses offered in the MA program.  \nLast Updated November 17, 2017       Page 4 of 7 \nOFFICE OF THE PROVOST AND VICE-PRESIDENT (ACADEMIC)  \nImplementation Plan \nIn response, the Faculty made the following commitments: \n● The Faculty agrees that performance indicators could be an area for future development. \n● The report recognizes the challenge faced by MACT with regard to its inability to raise \nprogram fees, even modestly, to reflect current value of the program. MACT will need to \ncontinue to work with the Dean’s office and the University (who is working with \nAdvanced education) to develop a strategy to address this matter. \n● MACT Alumni are currently invited to attend social events, extra-curricular webinars, and \nare encouraged to attend the annual Rundle Summit graduate student conference. \nMACT is looking into ways to further engage alumni with non-credit workshops and a \nprofessional stream at the Rundle Summit. \n● MACT will contact the University’s Centre for Teaching and Learning to inquire about \npossible opportunities specific to professional programs and look at opportunities to \ncoordinate with other professional schools at the University of Alberta  \n● The program will work with the Faculty of Graduate Studies and Research (FGSR) and \nits Professional Development initiative to identify best practices in mentoring and \nevaluation of mentoring with students.  \n● The Director of MACT will look into funding through the University’s Teaching and \nLearning Enhancement Fund (TLEF) to undertake a research project on innovative use \nof technologies in online and blended learning that can be applied to MACT program \ndelivery.  \n● The MACT program will continue working on the proposals for a Post-baccalaureate \ncertificate, which we intend to bring forward for review in the coming year.  \nPresident’s Visiting Committee \nReview Dates February 27-28, 2017 \nReviewers ● Dr. John LaBrie, (Committee Chair,) founding principal of Northeastern \nUniversity-Toronto; \n● Dr. Hiram Fitzgerald, Associate Provost for University Outreach and \nEngagement, Michigan State University; \n● Dr. Li-Shih Huang, Associate Professor, Learning and Teaching \nScholar-in-Residence, University of Victoria \n● Dr. Deanna Williamson, Department Chair, Human Ecology, University \nof Alberta; \nLast Updated November 17, 2017       Page 5 of 7 \nOFFICE OF THE PROVOST AND VICE-PRESIDENT (ACADEMIC)  \nOutcome \nThe President’s Visiting Committee (PVC) examined the scholarly activity of the Faculty as well \nas the Continuing and Professional Education, the English Language School, and the Graduate \nProfessional Programs. The report provides commendations and recommendations on all these \nareas.  \nThe Faculty of Extension is an interdisciplinary Faculty, guided by its consideration of the \nscholarship of engagement which unifies the diverse roles and interests of faculty members. In \nthe national context, the Faculty of Extension is an important contributor to scholarly articles in \nthis field of inquiry. The PVC report emphasized that the Faculty stands tall amongst its peer \ngroup thanks to the high level of community engagement, the success of Continuing \nProfessional Education Programs and the English Language School. \nFaculty Strengths \n● The Faculty of Extension Strategic and Research plans provide the organization with a \nforward looking and visionary document to guide future programmatic and investment \ndecisions.   \n● The Faculty of Extension has been successful in establishing a vibrant footprint in the \nurban core. There continues to be challenges, such as having limited access to the main \ncampus for international students, but the facilities provided the Faculty for its core work \nare of a high caliber and are well maintained and well used.   \n● The Faculty has received numerous national awards which are consistent with the work \nconducted and the mission of the Faculty.   \n● The Faculty is deeply and successfully engaged with community partners and the \noutcomes are consistent with the University’s commitment to engagement as outlined in \nFor the Public Good. The Faculty’s work in this area should be highlighted and \ncelebrated as best practice. \n● Community representatives, local officials, and students who contributed to the review \nspoke to the partnerships the Faculty has built. In addition, the research centres in the \nFaculty each have extensive networks within particular communities as do the certificate \nand degree programs.  \n● Extension faculty members are well-credentialed and diverse. There is a solid \ndistribution of academic backgrounds and a healthy level of professional engagement.   \nOpportunities for Improvement and Enhancement \nThe committee made several recommendations: \n● The PVC questioned the relevance of the name of the Faculty, pointing out that \nprogramming today shows little to no resemblance to traditional “extension” programs. \nThey recommend that a clearer name for the Faculty could eliminate possible confusion \nin the larger educational marketplace and position it in other programmatic areas. \nLast Updated November 17, 2017       Page 6 of 7 \nOFFICE OF THE PROVOST AND VICE-PRESIDENT (ACADEMIC)  \n● The Committee encouraged the Associate Dean for Research work with faculty to \nensure they have the tools and skills needed to enhance scholarly output based on their \nprogrammatic outcomes. Individual faculty should be strongly encouraged to develop a \nscholarship regime alongside their programmatic efforts. \n● The PVC believes that a stronger assessment and valuation regime on program and \nlearning outcomes should be implemented in the Continuing Professional Education \nprograms. This regime should be put in place to better measure and track student \nsuccess. \n● The PVC felt that the English Language School’s connection with other departments at \nthe University of Alberta could be strengthened through programs designed to facilitate \nthe entry of graduate students into the institution. This might be accomplished through \ndesigning a modular program that could be tailored to address both English for \nAcademic Purposes and discipline-specific needs at the graduate level. \n● The Committee encouraged the English Language School to systematically conduct \noutcomes assessment to demonstrate the effectiveness of its programs, and to prioritize \nits resources including for maintaining partnerships. \n● The English Language School was also encouraged to build on the strong foundation of \nthe Advanced Professional Program in English-Medium Instruction (APPEMI) by \nreaching out to units across the University of Alberta that have international English as \nan Additional Language faculty members. A service-based learning component could be \nbuilt in that would give instructors attending the APPEMI from overseas an opportunity to \nparticipate in a practicum component through partnerships with other faculties on \ncampus. \n● The PVC suggested that ELS should consider articulating their vision and mandate to \nhelp prioritize, sustain, and manage demands in ways that contribute to building \nstrengths. Implementing needs and outcomes assessment (beyond enrollment counts, \ncompletion rates, and crude experience ratings) would enable the school to evaluate the \neffectiveness of each seed program for future implementation. \nImplementation Plan \nIn response, the Faculty made the following commitments: \n● The Faculty has started the process to contemplate a name change. After information-\ngathering, a process will formally begin in fall 2017 and hopefully result in an Extension \nFaculty Council approved name change to bring forward to University Governance in \n2018. \n● The Faculty will continue to actively encourage participation in engagement specific \nknowledge mobilization by highlighting appropriate publishing venues in discussions with \nthe professoriate, Continuing Professional Education and English Language School \nstaff. Extension will also develop more formal incentives and performance expectations \nin this regard.  \n● Rigorous student assessments are already conducted in all Continuing Professional \nLast Updated November 17, 2017       Page 7 of 7 \nOFFICE OF THE PROVOST AND VICE-PRESIDENT (ACADEMIC)  \nEducation programs; however some changes have been made to improve results. This \nmay resolve the area identified by the PVC. \n● Regarding potential areas of development for the English Language School within the \nUniversity, the ELS team has started to engage with departments across campus. After \ngathering information on needs of incoming and current graduate students, they plan to \nraise awareness about the existence of English for Academic Purposes offering at \nExtension. This initiative is expected to be implemented by September 2017. \n● Work has begun on defined learning outcomes for the English Language School’s \nprograms. They will focus on English language goals and cultural learning beyond the \nexperiential learning taking place during field trips.  \n● The Faculty is building connections to support APPEMI participants. They are also \ndeveloping an interchangeable set of modules that are delivered in multiple modes (e.g. \nonline, face-to-face, on-site, off-shore, through synchronous and asynchronous \ninteractions, conference style, etc.), which can be aggregated flexibly. APPEMI is \navailable as an approved credential or as a customized series. \n● The recommendation to clarify the English Language School’s mission is well taken, and \nin fact, the newly developed vision and mandate of ELS, when operationalized, will \ndefine the parameters of ELS’ programs. \nLast Updated November 17, 2017       Page 1 of 8 \nOFFICE OF THE PROVOST AND VICE-PRESIDENT (ACADEMIC)  \nUniversity of Alberta Quality Assurance Suite of Activities \nFaculty of Rehabilitation Medicine: Academic Program Reviews and President’s \nVisiting Committee  \nExcerpted Reports \nExecutive Summary \nThe Faculty of Rehabilitation Medicine at the University of Alberta (UAlberta) is one of the \nleading Canadian faculties in rehabilitation education and research with a strong reputation in \nCanada and abroad. Three separate reviews took place between February and April 2017 with \na total of ten external reviewers invited from the best rehabilitation science programs in Canada \nand internationally. \nReviewers were unanimous in their commendations of the academic programs offered by the \nFaculty. The three professional programs were recognized for their high-quality, outstanding \nand well-respected professional education in Physical Therapy (PT), Occupational Therapy \n(OT) and Speech Language Pathology (SLP). Reviewers commended the distributed learning \nprograms which offer OT and PT programs in satellite sites in Calgary and Augustana Campus \nin Camrose. \nThe Rehabilitation Science Graduate Thesis Programs (MSc. and PhD) were also recognized \nfor their strengths including the quality of their faculty and students, and the intensity and \nproductivity of research being conducted by them. The long term research partnerships that \nhave been cultivated by faculty members were found to be a strength. \nThe President’s Visiting Committee (PVC) endorsed the four broad goals laid out in Faculty’s \nstrategic plan which was approved in 2017. The PVC was impressed by the research funding, \nthe entrepreneurial spirit in the Faculty as well as its well-earned reputation as a student-\ncentered academic unit. \nAll three committees had the opportunity to tour the Corbett Hall facilities and on-site clinical \nfacilities.

A President’s Visiting Committee was convened at the same time \nto review the Faculty’s research, scholarly activity, and strategic directions. As a five-year \nreview of both the JD and graduate programs scheduled for 2012-13 did not proceed, the \ncurrent review marked the first time the Faculty’s programs had been reviewed since 2008. As \nthe PhD program was introduced in 2009, this was the first time the PhD program was \nreviewed. \nThree external review committees were composed and pursued their work concurrently during a \nsite visit in May 2017. Their report concluded that the JD is a “first rate conventional Canadian \nJD program.” They commended the commitment of faculty and staff, and noted that students, \nalumni and regulators they met with were pleased with the program outcomes. They \nrecommend that the curriculum be examined and that the Faculty continue its work to evaluate \nexperiential learning, research culture, Indigenous content, and student supports.  \nThe Graduate Program Review committee commended the Faculty on the successful \nintroduction of the PhD program and generally finds that the thesis-based LL.M and PhD \nprograms are healthy. They note that both programs are furthering the research achievements \nof the students who undertake them within a supportive Faculty environment. They recommend \nthat the Faculty consider the specific direction on the research culture and environment in its \ndraft strategic plan, make some program and curricular changes to the thesis-based LL.M and \nPhD and that substantive changes to the course-based LL.M. be considered. \nThe President’s Visiting Committee observed that the Faculty is made up of leading legal \nscholars and teachers, a solid, well regarded and relatively traditional JD curriculum, and a high \nregard within the legal profession for the quality of its graduates. The Committee recommended \nthat the draft strategic plan could benefit from additional focus and specificity in the direction set \nout, particularly with respect to research aspirations, and the PVC provided some high level \nfeedback regarding the culture and environment in the Faculty.    \nLast Updated November 17, 2017       Page 2 of 10 \nOFFICE OF THE PROVOST AND VICE-PRESIDENT (ACADEMIC)  \nUndergraduate Program Review \nPrograms \nReviewed \n● Juris Doctor (JD) program \nReview Dates May 24-25, 2017 \nReviewers ● Stephanie Ben-Ishai, (Committee Chair), Full Professor Osgoode \nSchool of Law, York University  \n● Christie Ford, Associate Professor and Director Centre for Business \nLaw, University of British Columbia  \n● Lois Harder, Chair and Professor of Political Science, University of \nAlberta \nOutcome \nThe Juris Doctor (JD) program was reviewed as a part of the Faculty of Law Quality Assurance \nprocesses in May, 2017. The Faculty completed a self-study on the program which was \nauthored by the Dean and Vice-Dean and informed by various Faculty documents.  \nA visiting committee was asked to evaluate the JD program structure, faculty, teaching and \nlearning, program environment, and the comparative analysis using the faculty’s self-study and \na two-day site-visit.  \nBoth the self-study and the Committee report note that the JD and the Faculty of Law are \nsubject to an annual evaluation and review by the Federation of Law Societies of Canada and \nhave been approved every year since the Federation introduced its new regime.  \nThe self-study highlights the Faculty’s reflection on future considerations and commitments for \nthe JD, including: \n• A comprehensive review of first year/upper year “core” curriculum in the JD, although no \nsignificant change in direction for the core program is anticipated based on feedback \nreceived during the two year strategic plan consultation process. \n• Commitment to developing a “thoughtful, respectful, meaningful and sustainable \nresponse to the report of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) of Canada”. \n• Plan to further enhance opportunities for experiential learning that align with the \nFaculty’s particular traditions and service. \n• Replenishment of faculty complement to levels observed in 2007/2008 (36.5 FTE) that \nhad dropped to 26 FTE in 2014-15 and to reinforce staff positions for front line student \nservices. \n• Comparison with Dalhousie and Queen's JD programs based on admissions criteria and \nranking in Maclean's magazine as among the top 5 law school programs in Canada \n(UAlberta was rated 7th overall); comparison with UC Davis based on admissions \nLast Updated November 17, 2017       Page 3 of 10 \nOFFICE OF THE PROVOST AND VICE-PRESIDENT (ACADEMIC)  \ncriteria and similarity of faculty/university profile. \n• Assessment of the impact of changes to law programming and articling/transition to \npractice requirements by regulators are actively under discussion; the transformation of \nlaw practice which could reshape the JD program in ways in which the Faculty is as yet \nnot structured to undertake. \nThe Committee submitted a report on their observations about the JD Program which they note \nwere gathered primarily on-site. The report highlights a number of areas of strength in the JD \nprogram as well as opportunities for enhancement.   \nProgram Strengths \nFaculty and Staff: \n• The Committee was impressed with the expertise and academic profile of the faculty and \nfelt they met the needs of the JD program. \n• They noted that the faculty they met were uniformly committed to teaching, learning and \ndelivery of the JD program. \n• The staff the Committee met were observed to be energetic, hardworking and committed \nin positions which were demanding. \nIndigenous enrollment: \n• The Committee recognized the comparatively large number of Indigenous students \nadmitted in 2016-17.  \n• They noted the Faculty’s efforts to respond to the Calls to Action in the Truth and \nReconciliation Commission’s recommendations, including two pilot seminars recently \noffered. \nStudent satisfaction: \n• The Committee found that students appeared to be happy with the relatively traditional, \ndoctrinal legal education they were receiving. \n• They emphasized the value of individual faculty efforts to support student learning and \nthe Faculty’s introduction of various wellness initiatives. \nOpportunities for Program Improvement and enhancement \nThe committee made several recommendations. The Faculty was encouraged to: \n• Ensure the curriculum of the JD is up-to-date and reflects current practices. \n• Ensure that experiential offerings were aimed to develop practice ready lawyers or to \ncontribute to the public good. \n• Continue their approach to take efforts at social innovation in legal education seriously \nLast Updated November 17, 2017       Page 4 of 10 \nOFFICE OF THE PROVOST AND VICE-PRESIDENT (ACADEMIC)  \nwithin the context of the local legal culture. \n• Reinforce the research culture among JD students and faculty members. \n• Articulate and communicate learning objectives at the program and course level to \nstudents, faculty and alumni. \n• Make diversity in the faculty population an area of focus for recruitment. \n• Ensure that sessional instructors are aware of the Faculty’s responsibilities and \ncommitments to realizing the Truth and Reconciliation Commission’s Calls to Action. \n• Better support faculty career and professional development and better communicate \nrequirements for tenure and promotion. \n• Track alumni outcomes as a mechanism to evaluate development needs. \nImplementation Plan \nIn response, the Faculty made the following commitments: \n● The Faculty’s Curriculum Committee will be tasked in 2017-18 with responsibility for \nundertaking a review, guided by any directions provided by the Federation of Law \nSocieties and/or provincial law societies as they further consider JD degree \nrequirements and prerequisites for transition to practice. \n● The issue of articulating and communicating learning outcomes will be referred to the \nCurriculum Committee following the Faculty Retreat, subject to any further direction from \nthe University about a mandatory university-wide approach. \n● The Faculty will maintain dialogue with Law Society of Alberta, the Federation of Law \nSocieties and other provincial regulators regarding potential changes to experiential \nlearning requirements in the JD program. In addition, the implementation of \nrecommendations from the Dean’s Special Advisory Committee on Experiential Learning \n(2015-16) and the Strategic Planning Process will be explored. \n● The Faculty has had increasingly diverse candidate pools during the 2015-16 and 2016-\n17 recruitment cycles. In addition to other ongoing efforts to support diversity, the \nFaculty will make diversity training mandatory for Advisory Selection Committee \nmembers and open training opportunities (if possible) to all Faculty members. \n● The Assistant Director and new Assistant Dean Advancement will be asked to consult \nwith the University Office of Alumni Relations with respect to alumni information data to \ndetermine whether demographic data is collected and available for analysis. \n● The Faculty noted and will continue to promote numerous ongoing efforts to support \nresearch culture including the Research Workshop/Tri-Council Funding, Health Law \nInstitute and the Centre for Constitutional Studies, as well as the appointment of a new \nposition, Associate Dean for Research and Faculty Development. \n● The Faculty will continue efforts to implement the Calls to Action including recruitment \nand outreach, curriculum renewal, recruitment of Indigenous faculty, and hosting of \nconferences and training. \nLast Updated November 17, 2017       Page 5 of 10 \nOFFICE OF THE PROVOST AND VICE-PRESIDENT (ACADEMIC)  \nGraduate Program Review \nPrograms \nReviewed \n● The LL.M course based and thesis based programs \n● Doctoral (PhD) programs \nReview Dates May 24-25, 2017 \nReviewers ● James Penner, (Committee Chair), Professor of Law and Vice Dean \n(Research), National University of Singapore \n● Michael Maier, Associate Dean MBA Program, University of Alberta \n● Bill Connor, Office of the Provost, University of Alberta \nOutcome \nThe course-based and thesis-based Master of Laws (LL.M), and the PhD in Law were reviewed \nin a concurrent process with the JD review. The self-study was drafted by the Associate Dean \n(Graduate Studies) Matthew Lewans under the direction of Dean Paton.  \nThe self study provides several reflections on graduate programs in the Faculty of Law: \n● The Faculty needs to rebuild and maintain a larger complement of full-time professors \nwho are dedicated to producing and disseminating high quality, peer-reviewed \nscholarship. \n● Based on current enrolment trends in the Graduate Program, the Faculty should \nconsider targeting the recruitment of Faculty members who can teach graduate-level \ncourses on topics relating to Oil, Gas, and Natural Resources Law; Criminal Law; \nCorporate & Commercial Law; and Constitutional Law. \n● The Faculty should clarify and strengthen linkages between the Graduate Program and \nthe Health Law Institute and the Centre for Constitutional Studies. \n● The Faculty should recruit a full-time research director for the Centre for Constitutional \nStudies to benefit the Graduate Program by further raising its profile and expanding its \ncapacity for conducting advanced research in constitutional law. \n● The Faculty should seek to secure, from the Provost, Faculty of Graduate Studies, or \nother sources, multi-year funding packages and financial support for incoming graduate \nstudents.  \nAn external review committee was invited to evaluate the Faculty’s graduate programs using the \nself-study, other relevant documents and during a May 2017 site-visit. The Review committee \nidentified the strengths, weaknesses, and challenges facing the graduate programme and \nsubmitted a report outlining recommendations for the graduate programs. \nProgram Strengths \nThe Committee’s report identified numerous strengths in the Faculty of Law graduate programs: \nLast Updated November 17, 2017       Page 6 of 10 \nOFFICE OF THE PROVOST AND VICE-PRESIDENT (ACADEMIC)  \n● Strong alignment of the PhD program with the University’s Institutional Strategic Plan, \nFor the Public Good. \n● The PhD is vital to the academic mission of the Faculty of Law, and has served to \ndifferentiate the Faculty in Canada and internationally. \n● The thesis-based LL.M. provides a valuable opportunity for prospective academics to get \na sense of whether research is something they wish to pursue; three recent PhD grads \npreviously completed their LL.M. at the Faculty. \n● The learning environment, library and electronic resources, teaching space and the \nfacilities are entirely adequate. \n● The retention and completion rates and the achievement in terms of scholarly work was \nin keeping with the student’s progression as research students. \n● Students are happy with their programs and the support they are receiving from \nprofessors in supervisory and other support roles. \n● Ph.D students felt welcome and supported in the Faculty. \n Opportunities for Program Improvement and Enhancement \nThe committee made several recommendations: \n● The Faculty’s draft strategic plan could be amended to provide more specific direction on \nthe research culture and environment, graduate program funding, and the relationship \nbetween centres and graduate programs. \n● It was also recommended that the balance between teaching, service and research \nrequirements for Faculty members be reviewed. \n● The credit for supervision of PhD students is too low and should be reconsidered. \n● The Faculty should consider making substantive changes to the course-based LL.M to \nensure that it better aligns with strategic objectives. \n● Some considerations for curricula and the learning environment were provided including \nrethinking the graduate seminar and opening enrolment to students beyond first year in \nthesis-based LL.M and PhD students. \n● PhD students should be given more precise and consistent information on requirements \nfor candidacy exams. \n● The Faculty was encouraged to better articulate the how their programs fulfill the FGSR \nmandated PD requirement to be afforded the current exemption. \nLast Updated November 17, 2017       Page 7 of 10 \nOFFICE OF THE PROVOST AND VICE-PRESIDENT (ACADEMIC)  \nImplementation Plan \nIn response, the Faculty made the following commitments: \n• The Faculty agrees that there are substantial funding implications for any changes to be \nmade to graduate programs and points to the roll-back of market modifiers, the decline \nin FTE professors in recent years, the perceived limitations on enrolment in graduate \nprogramming and the lack of external grant support. \n• The Faculty agrees that the credit allocation should be reviewed but notes that any \nchange will need to be balanced against Faculty resources constraints in order to ensure \ncomprehensive delivery of the JD and graduate programs. The balance between \nteaching, research and service is a matter both for collective agreement and individual \ncontract negotiations with Faculty. \n• The Faculty has taken steps to limit enrolment in the course-based LL.M. program and is \nopen to rethinking the program. The Faculty will explore appropriate options. \n• The Faculty agrees (some) students may benefit from the Professional Development \nProgram and the Associate Dean Graduate studies is tasked with reviewing. \n• The Faculty agreed with the considerations for curricula and will seek to implement the \nnecessary changes for the 2018-19 academic year.

In \naddition, members of the Faculty have been successful in attracting funding for their \nresearch activities.  \n● The Centre for Constitutional Studies and the Health Law Institute as well as the Alberta \nLaw Reform Institute have national and international reputations for significant, cutting \nedge research. \n● The Faculty of Law has signalled its commitment to the Calls to Action of the Truth and \nReconciliation Commission and has shown encouraging results including recruitment of \nIndigenous students, expansion of course offerings, and experiential learning activities. \n Opportunities for Improvement and enhancement \nThe committee made several recommendations: \n● Building on the recent work to consolidate administrative support, the Committee \nrecommended that the staffing structure be reviewed with an eye to supporting faculty \nresearch, communications and fundraising. \n● The Committee suggested that the research strategy as outlined in the Faculty’s draft \nstrategic plan would benefit from focus in the form of a specific more ambitious research \ndirection, goals and measurement indicators. \n● While impressed by the faculty’s individual research agendas, the Committee \nrecommends that initiatives to encourage collegial involvement in the development of \nstrategic direction, curriculum design, student and staff recruitment, communications and \nadvancement be taken. \n● The committee recommended more focused and strategic support for research and \nscholarship, including staffing and structure. \n● The Committee noted inconsistency in the application of standards for tenure and \npromotion and recommended that efforts be made to more clearly articulate and apply \nthem. \n● In the interest of providing feedback and guidance to junior and mid-career scholars, the \nCommittee encouraged that annual performance reviews and mentoring be considered. \n● Recognising the continuing research emphasis on texts and teaching casebooks, the \nCommittee recommended that the Faculty encourage more primary research including \narticles in peer-reviewed journals (especially international), essays in selected edited \ncollections, monographs and leading texts in specific fields. \n● The Committee recommended that the draft Strategic Plan could benefit from additional \nfocus and specificity in its strategic directions. In addition, while recognising the \nconsultation process undertaken in developing the strategic plan, the committee \nsuggested the work needs to more fully involve the faculty, and its direction ultimately \nLast Updated November 17, 2017       Page 10 of 10 \nOFFICE OF THE PROVOST AND VICE-PRESIDENT (ACADEMIC)  \nneeds endorsement from the whole faculty. The plan also needs to be more explicit \nregarding achievement of research excellence and the specific means for doing so. \n● The work of the Faculty to advance diversity initiatives was recognized and the \nCommittee believed that the success of these efforts would be enhanced by further work \nand institutional commitments to diversity, particularly gender diversity. \n● The PVC provided some high level feedback regarding the culture and environment in \nthe Faculty.  In conjunction with Faculty Administration, the University will pursue a more \nfocused and detailed review of the work environment. \nImplementation Plan \nIn response, the Faculty noted the following: \n● In fall 2017, the Faculty were leading the implementation phase of the strategic plan to \nrefine the tasks and determine responsibility, timelines and deliverables that would be \npublished in the final report in early 2018. \n● Efforts to assist the rebuilding of the Faculty and the transformation of a culture that pre-\ndated 2014 are necessary and to be welcomed. The manner in which such efforts are \nundertaken need to be sensitive to the “functional and emotional implications for the \norganization” noted in an independent external 2015-16 review commissioned by the \nDean, the report of which was provided to the Strategic Planning Steering Committee to \nguide its work and recommendations.  \nLast Updated November 17, 2017       Page 1 of 12 \nOFFICE OF THE PROVOST AND VICE-PRESIDENT (ACADEMIC)  \nUniversity of Alberta Quality Assurance Suite of Activities \nFaculty of Agricultural, Life and Environmental Sciences (ALES): \nAcademic Program Reviews and President’s Visiting Committee  \nExcerpted Reports \nExecutive Summary \nThe Faculty of Agricultural, Life and Environmental Sciences (ALES) undertook a Quality \nAssurance review of undergraduate and graduate programs as well as a President’s Visiting \nCommittee (PVC) in 2017. Two external review teams were brought in: a program review team, \nwhich examined academic programs from all four departments, and a PVC to look at research \nand strategic directions.  \nThe program review committee commended the undergraduate and graduate programs noting \nthe expertise and engagement of faculty members, student academic achievement and awards \nand alumni employment outcomes. They see ALES’ facilities as a major strength of programs \nand note the breadth of opportunities for research and experiential learning at both the \nundergraduate and graduate level. \nOpportunities for program enhancement include student advising, communication and \nmentoring, redevelopment of course-based master’s into professional programs, and continued \nwork in developing Indigenous course content and expertise. \nThe PVC concluded that “...the Faculty is in an enviable position, with world class faculty \nmembers, a truly interdisciplinary nature and excellent research and creative output Indicators.” \nThey provided numerous recommendations for opportunities in research and strategic directions \nincluding leadership for interdisciplinary programs and research, development of a more \nfocused international strategy, and investment in tools for alumni monitoring, learning outcomes \nand teaching assessment.

They encouraged ALES to take on even more of a role of showing \nhow interdisciplinary research can be carried out at the U of A, strengthening the Faculty \nstrategic plan by making it more quantitative, strategically developing international student \nrecruitment, creation of an interdisciplinary internationally marketed course-based masters, and \nthe development of Co-op options in some of the undergraduate programs. \n The PVC congratulated the Faculty for its many accomplishments and encouraged it to set \nambitious, aspirational goals for itself as it is uniquely positioned to achieve them. \nFaculty Strengths \n●    The committee noted that the Faculty encompasses a large number of disciplines \nand sub-disciplines that reflect the educational, research and service needs of the \nprovince. They commend the management of such a sizable portfolio and the \ninternational stature of a number of program areas. \n●    The committee found the indicated support for staff/faculty development to be solid \nand observed good collegiality within the Faculty management team. \nLast Updated November 17, 2017       Page 10 of 12 \nOFFICE OF THE PROVOST AND VICE-PRESIDENT (ACADEMIC)  \n●    The field-based laboratories dedicated to extensive and/or system research were \nfound to offer substantial support for work of this nature. \n●    The review committee was impressed by the number of Canada Research Chairs, \nCampus Alberta Innovation Program Chairs and NSERC Industrial Chairs. \n●    The research enterprise was found overall to be very successful as judged by \nincreases in tri-council funding and bibliometric measures showing that the various \ncomponent disciplines of ALES rank well (3rd or 4th) amongst groupings of well-\nchosen and well-respected comparators. \n●    ALES appears to be doing a very good job of preparing its graduates for successful \ncareers in areas of study that provide important benefits for the public good. \n●    There has been significant growth in the number of post-doc positions funded by \nindividual faculty members which speaks highly to the research success and helps to \nexplain increases seen in publication productivity. \nOpportunities for Faculty Improvement and enhancement \nThe committee made several recommendations: \n●    The committee noted the relatively modest percentage of assistant professors, \nrelative to individuals in the associate and full-professor ranks and recommend \nseeking a better balance in the mid to long term. They encouraged making the \nrecruitment of women a priority. \n●    The PVC found the number of endowed chairs modest given the size of the Faculty \nand number of faculty members. They recognise the difficulty in creating these \nopportunities and recommend that continued priority be given to development efforts \nin this area. \n●    They suggested that research priorities be considered in the next iteration of the \nstrategic plan to guide research choices, and the conditions under which individual \nresearchers or research teams might be expected to follow that guidance. \n●    Given that much of the research in ALES is of an interdisciplinary nature, the PVC \nsuggested there is an opportunity to provide leadership in interdisciplinary research \nacross faculties and beyond as a broker, facilitator, or initiator for a wide range of \nresearch endeavours. \nLast Updated November 17, 2017       Page 11 of 12 \nOFFICE OF THE PROVOST AND VICE-PRESIDENT (ACADEMIC)  \n●    The PVC recommends formal tracking mechanisms for alumni from both the \ngraduate and undergraduate programs to better articulate the success of graduates \nand the value of the learning outcomes from programs. \n●    The Committee suggested there is an opportunity to expand transfer and \ncollaborative programming with colleges in Alberta and the Yukon Territory. \n●    Expansion of approved course-based Master’s is an opportunity to engage alumni \nand generate revenue. The Committee also suggested exploring post-graduate \ncertificates that would ladder into the course-based Master’s programs. \n●    With regards to PDFs, the following recommendations were suggested for \nconsideration:  1) Systematic collection of information on the PDF and RA positions \nas noted in the Faculty self-study; 2) Document the achievements, backgrounds, \ncareer outcomes of the postdocs; 3) Improve the website presence for the \nPDF/Research Assistant positions; 4) Cultivate a community within the Faculty; 5) \nSeek more equitable distribution across departments. \nImplementation Plan \nIn response, the Faculty made the following commitments: \n● Take a leadership role in connecting work across disciplines within the realm of \nagriculture-food-nutrition-health and in environment (soil, water, biodiversity, \nreclamation, ecology, policy), in food security, nutrition and health, environmental \nsustainability, the bio economy and strengthening the well-being of individuals \nand communities. \n● Implement the goal identified in the ALES strategic plan of creating a “hub” for \npeople to interact. \n● Develop research themes and grand challenges by December 2017 as outlined \nin the ALES strategic plan to guide specialization of faculty and staff members \nand support efficiencies goal attainment. \n● Launch a program to support ALES’ interdisciplinary capacity and to enhance \ncross-department connections by June 2018. \n● Examine the possibility of establishing a Faculty strategic investment fund. \n● Develop an international strategy to maintain and diversify international student \nenrolment and to examine international programming. \n● Refine efforts to understand alumni outcomes including coordinating efforts with \nthe University and the provincial government. \n● Define Faculty-level learning outcomes which will be used as the basis for \nreviewing, revising and defining program-level learning outcomes. \n● Examine opportunities for multi-faceted evaluation of teaching. \n● Consider expansion of course-based master’s programs once the province has \nLast Updated November 17, 2017       Page 12 of 12 \nOFFICE OF THE PROVOST AND VICE-PRESIDENT (ACADEMIC)  \nclarified its position on tuition. \n● Continue to engage in efforts to increase the proportion of assistant professors, \nIndigenous faculty members, and gender diversity. \n● Continue to embrace the roles of post-doctoral fellows and research assistance \nwithin the ALES community.  \nLast Updated November 17, 2017       Page 1 of 7 \nOFFICE OF THE PROVOST AND VICE-PRESIDENT (ACADEMIC)  \nUniversity of Alberta Quality Assurance Suite of Activities \nSchool of Public Health: Academic Program Reviews and President’s Visiting \nCommittee  \nExcerpted Reports \nExecutive Summary \nThe review of graduate programs in the School of Public Health was undertaken in conjunction \nwith the President’s Visiting Committee.

They noted the interdisciplinary focus of \nthe programs. \n● The performance of faculty members in research was noted, as was the close \nrelationship between research, teaching and other activities. \n● The committee recognized several of the strategic directions outlined in the self-study. \nThey saw potential in undergraduate course offerings as a mechanism to support \nrecruitment, especially of Indigenous students. \n● The GPRC considered the School’s recruitment of a Canada Research Chair in \nAboriginal and Northern Health and plans to recruit students to work on Indigenous \nissues as a positive step in the context of Reconciliation.  \n Opportunities for Program Improvement and enhancement \nThe committee made several recommendations: \n● The process for a new strategic plan should be commenced as soon as possible and an \noperational plan, reflecting the School’s strategic plan, should be developed. \n● Enrolment of Indigenous students should be made a priority and supported through \ndifferent mechanisms. Strategic alliances with other faculties who have made progress \ntoward Indigenous inclusiveness was suggested as a strategy. \n● Enrolment management through strategic targeting was recommended; among other \nthings, this could be supported through marketing actions, selection criteria and \nincentives. \n● Student-centred approaches and procedures should be better articulated including \ncommunication with students and student advising.  \n● The range, number and sequencing of course offerings should be monitored considering \nresources available, efficiencies for faculty and students, and evolving public health \nchallenges and requirements.  \n● Cross-faculty student initiatives at both the undergraduate and graduate level were \nrecommended. \n● More systematic engagement of alumni was recommended to support the achievement \nof course outcomes and student success. \nImplementation Plan \nIn response, the School made the following commitments: \n● The School will complete the review and renewal of its educational programs over the \n2017-2018 academic year. This will include a new MPH curriculum for implementation in \nthe fall 2018 term and a review of degree specialization programs to continue to respond \nto the public-health workforce needs. An operational plan with goals and measurable \nobjectives for academic and professional development training will also be developed for \nLast Updated November 17, 2017       Page 4 of 7 \nOFFICE OF THE PROVOST AND VICE-PRESIDENT (ACADEMIC)  \nthe reaccreditation process at the School. \n● As a first step in the development of a new strategic plan for 2019-2024, the School will \nbegin research planning in the summer of 2017. \n● The School agreed with the need to expand activities to increase enrolment of \nIndigenous students and are working to integrate culturally appropriate topics in \nIndigenous health in curricula. Faculty and staff member resources have been devoted \nto the area of Indigenous engagement. Further, targeted recruitment activities more \ngenerally are planned. \n● A student-centred approach will continue to be a focus of the school. Actions are \nunderway to clarify responsibilities for staff and leadership to ensure positive \nrelationships are maintained with students including communications and advising. \n● The curriculum review process has already begun and moved beyond the core curricula \nto faculty resources, student interests and changing priorities in the field. \n● The School already offers some courses to undergraduate students including \nintroductory graduate courses. Work will continue in this area. \nPresident’s Visiting Committee \nReview Dates April 20-21, 2017 \nReviewers ● Dr. Donna J. Petersen, (Committee Chair,) Dean, College of Public \nHealth, University of South Florida \n● Dr. Charlyn Black, Associate Director, UBC School of Population and \nPublic Health, University of British Columbia \n● Dr. John C. Spence, Vice Dean, Physical Education and Recreation, \nUniversity of Alberta \n● Dr. Bill Connor, Office of the Provost, University of Alberta \nOutcome \nThe PVC found the School to be well-positioned to contribute to For the Public Good with its \nclear focus on recruiting and educating outstanding students; conducting high quality relevant \nresearch; and engaging communities. The PVC noted the success of the 2014-18 strategic plan \nand the objectives which have been achieved including stabilization of the School and \naccreditation. The School’s faculty have earned various marks of distinction for their work and \nhave strong records of obtaining funding. The PVC was impressed with the extensive array of \ninternational collaborations and the opportunities for student placements for education and \nresearch. The review found the School to be actively promoting engaged scholarship, making it \nwell-positioned to serve as a lead model for the further exploration of this idea within the \nUniversity.   \nLast Updated November 17, 2017       Page 5 of 7 \nOFFICE OF THE PROVOST AND VICE-PRESIDENT (ACADEMIC)  \nSchool’s Strengths \n● The School is a productive group, exhibiting a high level of curiosity and vitality in their \nresearch pursuits.  They remain consistently strong in research funding. \n● The Committee notes that the non-departmental structure is a strength encouraging \ngreater faculty participation in governance and supporting the multidisciplinary culture of \nthe School. \n● The PVC noted general satisfaction with the School’s facilities and space which seems \nlargely conducive to supporting faculty interaction as well as teaching and learning \nactivities. \n● The PVC commended the School for their success in developing partnerships (they note \n1100 partners have been inventoried locally and globally). The Committee feels that \npartnerships act as pathways for recruitment and potential advancement opportunities. \nThey also commended the School for its work to develop new frameworks for measuring \nand assessing the impact of this engagement. \n● The School has limited but growing industry relationships, typical of a School of Public \nHealth, and enjoys research partnerships with practice institutions and with colleagues \nacross campus, exemplifying their commitment to multidisciplinary research.  \n● They note the strength of communications including the web-site, social media, and \nmedia relations to connect with the public, alumni and community partners. They were \nimpressed by the “This is Public Health” campaign which helps promote awareness of \npublic health and the School on the campus and in the community.   \n● The PVC found the PhD to be a strong example of a “practice-based” program both in \nterms of the subject areas being investigated and the research methods used.  They \nnote the curricular elements in these programs which promote professional development \nin such areas as leadership, communication and systems-thinking.  Alumni spoke highly \nof the importance of these opportunities to their career development as public health \nprofessionals. \nOpportunities for Program Improvement and Enhancement \nThe committee made several recommendations: \n● The committee encouraged the School to start a strategic planning process to identify \nareas of strength and areas to strengthen in the future.  The future research agenda \ncould align with “signature areas.” The PVC also encouraged the School to continue to \nseek ways to measure community engagement and to compare outcomes with sister \ninstitutions. \nLast Updated November 17, 2017       Page 6 of 7 \nOFFICE OF THE PROVOST AND VICE-PRESIDENT (ACADEMIC)  \n● The PVC identified opportunities to simplify and clarify SPH’s administrative structure \nwhich comply with the new CEPH criteria. They believe by clarifying areas of \nresponsibility and allocating faculty time to critical areas, the functions and the roles and \nresponsibilities of some faculty could be lightened. \n● The Committee recommends that the School revisit the curricular streams (18 total) with \nthe number of core faculty (35 total) in mind. They also recommend enrolment planning. \n● In addition, they recommend that a single point of contact for students in the PhD and \nMSc programs be established for students seeking guidance or problem resolution.  \n● The PVC believes that Centers should be considered in the context of the research \nstrategic agenda and their likely return on investment. In addition, the School currently \nhas no endowed chairs or professorships. This should be a key goal of the new \nadvancement officer and the School’s leadership. \n● The Committee found the gender balance among faculty to be good overall; but an \nimbalance exists at the full professor level which they note the School is well aware of. \nThey note that all of the CRC’s are male and that there is opportunity for diversification \nas several of these chairs are open right now.  \n● The PVC recommends working to create a more welcoming and nurturing environment \nfor Postdoctoral Fellows including professional development. They suggested the School \nidentity a lead resource for the fellows to support recruitment, orienting/onboarding \nfellows, and convening them periodically for networking, mutual support and \ncollaboration.  \nImplementation Plan \nIn response, the School made the following commitments: \n● The School agreed that the time was right for strategic planning. The Associate Dean \n(Research) has initiated a process to develop a research strategy for SPH in the \nsummer of 2017.  \n● As recommended, the School will develop measurable goals and outcome indicators for \ncomparison with sister institutions in Canada. To accomplish this, the School will provide \nleadership for the establishment of a national database of agreed upon performance \nindicators for the network of schools and programs of public health in Canada. \n● The School agrees that the adoption of the new CEPH criteria necessitates re-thinking of \nthe MPH program structure. In 2017-2018, the Office of Educational Programs will \nundertake several initiatives to improve programs including better representing the \nprimary and secondary specialization structure of our MPH degrees, and reinforcing the \nsupport system for research degree programs, especially regarding student supervision. \nLast Updated November 17, 2017       Page 7 of 7 \nOFFICE OF THE PROVOST AND VICE-PRESIDENT (ACADEMIC)  \n● The School considers the establishment of interdisciplinary research centres a key \ncomponent of our research strategy and has initiated the internal university approval \nprocess for a Centre for Health System Improvement. SPH also anticipates the \ndevelopment of a Centre for Environment and Health. \n● The School renewal has been underway over the past two years. Future recruitment will \nreflect the new research strategy and continue efforts to diversify. \n● Although PVC was generally satisfied with facilities, the School has assessed the lab \nand faculty space occupied by the Environmental Health group to be at full capacity. The \nSchool intends to work with the VP Facilities in seeking a long term sustainable solution \nto this issue. \n● The School agrees that an enrolment plan is necessary and will work to develop one. \n● The School agreed with the assessment of the experience of Post-Doctoral Fellows and \nwill strive to improve the quality of their experience by developing a peer group for \nmutual support and a forum to discuss issues of common interests (such as job \nopportunities). \n\tItem-1-Agenda\n\tItem-4-QA-Reports\n\tItem-4-QA-Reports\n\tatt-1-Extension Quality Assurance Excerpted Report FINAL November 17, 2017\n\tExecutive Summary\n\tGraduate Program Review\n\tPresident’s Visiting Committee\n\tatt-2-Rehabilitation Medicine Quality Assurance Excerpted Reports FINAL November 17, 2017\n\tExecutive Summary\n\tProfessional Program Review\n\tThesis-based Program Review\n\tPresident’s Visiting Committee\n\tatt-3-Law Quality Assurance Excerpted Report FINAL November 17, 2017\n\tExecutive Summary\n\tUndergraduate Program Review\n\tGraduate Program Review\n\tFaculty Review\n\tImplementation Plan\n\tatt-4-ALES Quality Assurance Excerpted Reports Final November 17, 2017\n\tExecutive Summary\n\tUndergraduate and Graduate Program Review\n\tPresident’s Visiting Committee\n\tatt-5-SPH Quality Assurance Excerpted Report FINAL November 17, 2017\n\tExecutive Summary\n\tGraduate Program Review\n\tPresident’s Visiting Committee\n",
