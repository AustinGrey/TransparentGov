One of my goals over the next several months is to introduce For the Public \nGood to the wider community and to share with them the vision and aspirations of the university \nfor the next five years. As part of that awareness building, I will also be highlighting some of the \ninitiatives now underway.  \nWe will continue to develop and add to the For the Public Good website as the primary online \nplatform for communicating about the plan. The site will provide updates about the specific \nobjectives, intiatives, and strategic planning processes being undertaken  across the university \nand within faculties and units. As we finalize the metrics and measures of our succes, the site \nwill also house reports on our progress. \nRecent Initiatives \nThe following  initiatives point to key areas of progress and development within For the Public \nGood.  \nSignature Areas \nIn For the Public Good, the University of Alberta community committed to developing a portfolio \nof signature research and teaching areas where the university is or will be recognized as a \nglobal leader. To launch this objective, Provost Steve Dew, Vice-president (Research) Lorne \nBabiuk and I will host a campus forum on November 17. We will outline and initiate a cross-\ninstitution, interdisciplinary signature areas development process. We hope that all members of \nthe university will participate in this key discussion. As is indicated in For the Public Good, the \nsignature areas will be based on the following criteria: \nÔÇ∑ national and international stature for excellence, relevance, and impact\nÔÇ∑ critical mass‚Äîopportunity for broad, interdisciplinary engagement\nÔÇ∑ grassroots leadership, participation, and support from within our university community\nÔÇ∑ stakeholder partnerships\nÔÇ∑ research partners (international, community, government, industry)\nÔÇ∑ capacity to shape and align with federal and provincial research funding priorities\nÔÇ∑ student demand\nÔÇ∑ physical and operational capacity\nÔÇ∑ geographic or situational relevance\nI encourage everyone to register for the forum and join us on November 17. \nGENERAL FACULTIES COUNCIL\nFor the Meeting of November 21, 2016  \nItem No. 3\nhttp://www.president.ualberta.ca/\nhttp://blog.ualberta.ca/2016/09/state-of-university-address-2016.html\nhttp://blog.ualberta.ca/2016/09/state-of-university-address-2016.html\nhttps://www.ualberta.ca/strategic-plan\nhttps://www.ualberta.ca/strategic-plan\n2 \nIndigenous Relations and Reconciliation: \nAt the end of September, we hosted the 2nd annual Building Reconciliation Forum. Building \nReconciliation brought together Canadian university presidents and their leadership teams, First \nNations, M√©tis and Inuit leaders, student leaders, Indigenous scholars, and scholars dedicated \nto research that is conducted in partnership with‚Äîand is meaningful to‚ÄîIndigenous peoples. \nThe U of A was proud to host this important event, and I was honoured to be a part of the \nproceedings. I found it a remarkable opportunity to listen and learn from diverse and compelling \nperspectives on the role of post-secondary education in reconciliation. \nI‚Äôm heartened by the many reconciliation initiatives originating from all corners of our university.  \nThey indicate that the University of Alberta will continue work towards thoughtful, respectful, and \nmeaningful reconciliation with Indigenous peoples. \nUniversities Canada \nI recently accepted an invitiation to join the Universities Canada board of directors, effective \nimmediately. Universities Canada is made up of 97 member institutions from across the country, \nand focuses on building collaboration amongst universities and governments, the private sector, \ncommunities and international partners. I look forward to my membership on the board of \ndirectors as an opportunity to cultivate our relationship with the federal government, and \nadvance the U of A‚Äôs strengths and interests at the national level.  \nInternational Travel \nThis October, I witnessed first hand the breadth, depth and reach of the University of Alberta‚Äôs \nrelationships and partnerships in China.  During our tour of China, we signed memoranda of \nunderstanding with three different institutions: Tsinghua University (Joint Energy Systems \nResearch Centre), East China Normal University (advanced scientific research centre), and  \nChina Electric Technology Group Corporation (research service agreement). \nChina‚Äôs vice-minister of education commended the University of Alberta‚Äôs high level of \nengagement in China. In addition to opening the door to many partnerships, that engagement \nrecently put us into position to lead the creation of the Canadian Learning Initiative in China \n(CLIC), which enables two-way, study-abroad opportunities for both Canadian and Chinese \nstudents.   \nI have provided a more detailed relflection about the tour on The Quad. \nI depart for India near the end of November, and I‚Äôm looking forward to another productive and \nengaging trip. I have several government and industry meetings scheduled, and I will be \nparticipating in a panel discussion on alternative energy solutions at the 2016 PetroTech \nConference. I will provide updates following the trip.  \nhttps://www.ualberta.ca/news-and-events/newsarticles/2016/october/walking-the-walk-on-truth-and-reconciliation\nhttp://blog.ualberta.ca/2016/11/from-presidents-desk-nov-1.html\n3 \nAcademic Excellence \nAt the end of October, 20 graduate students, post-doctoral fellows, and professors were \nrecognized at the annual Killam celebration for their outstanding academic achievement, \nleadership, and mentorship. The Killam awards are a tradition that stretches back nearly half a \ncentury at the University of Alberta. \nThe U of A was recently named one of Canada‚Äôs top five universities as part of the Maclean‚Äôs \nannual university rankings. The Maclean‚Äôs ranking is based on five broad areas: quality of \nstudents, faculty, resources, student support, and reputation. The ranking is a reflection of the \nhigh-quality, supportive learning environment that we‚Äôve created at the University of Alberta. I \nwant to thank each of you for the contributions that you make to this great university.  \nSenior Leadership Transitions \nAs many of you know, Richard Fedorak has been appointed dean of the Faculty of Medicine & \nDentistry for the period November 1, 2016 to June 30, 2021.

This document presents preliminary recommendations, \nupdated following initial consultation with the university community.  \nPrinciples for performance indicators: \nIn June 2016, the President‚Äôs Executive Committee ‚Äì Strategic (PEC-S) endorsed the following principles: \n‚Ä¢ a focused, manageable framework that blends quantitative and qualitative indicators \n‚Ä¢ indicators reflecting outcomes rather than simply activities, where possible \n‚Ä¢ integrity and efficiency of data collection \n‚Ä¢ relevance of indicators to FPG objectives \n‚Ä¢ selection of relevant comparators \n‚Ä¢ timely modification of indicators to reflect institutional evolution (NOTE: indicators will be adjusted to \nreflect priorities identified through implementation already underway, e.g. defining  signature areas)  \nReporting contexts: \nThe U of A has two primary reporting contexts, each of which warrants distinct indicators: \n‚Ä¢ Government (public) reporting: Comprehensive Institutional Plan (CIP), Annual Report (AR).  \no The CIP and Annual Report are based on provincial guidelines, which recommend that \ninstitutions develop approximately 15 performance measures. These tend to be outcome-\nbased, and should present a comprehensive view of the institution‚Äôs core functions.  \n‚Ä¢ Internal indicators: administrative and other Board of Governors reports.  \no These tend to be activity-based indicators, indicators for trend identification, and/or faculty-\nlevel information not suitable for overall institutional reporting. \nThe table on page two provides an overview of recommended indicators for each FPG Goal. Indicators may be \nrelevant to multiple FPG Goals, but each is listed only under the area of most direct relevance. Faculty-level \nbreakdowns can be made available for use by individual units where sufficient data exists.  \nThe remainder of this document presents detailed descriptions of these indicators and existing targets. The \nexamples provided are drawn from existing reports and may not yet reflect the full scope of each indicator. \nAcronyms: \nNSSE National Survey on Student Engagement - standardized survey administered by over 500 institutions in \nCanada and the U.S. \nGOS Graduate Outcomes Survey ‚Äì biennial survey of Alberta post-secondary graduates, conducted two years \npost-graduation (includes undergraduate and graduate levels) \nCGPSS Canadian Graduate and Professional Student Survey ‚Äì national survey of student satisfaction \nCAST Contract Academic Staff ‚Äì Teaching \nTRC Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada \nSTARS Sustainability Tracking, Assessment and Rating System  \nhttps://www.ualberta.ca/strategic-plan\n2 \nOverview of Performance Indicators \nFPG Alignment Government (public) reporting Internal indicators \nBUILD \n1.

In 2008, the Board of Governors endorsed the institution‚Äôs \nsustainability commitment and guiding principles, the creation of the \ncampus sustainability initiative and the launch of the Office of \nSustainability.  \nThe University of Alberta has recently reaffirmed its commitment to \nadvance sustainability through For the Public Good. A new sustainability \nplan has been developed for 2016-2020 as well as a companion \ndocument to inform academic planning. The new sustainability plan \noutlines areas for improving our institution‚Äôs sustainability performance \nand educational programming. It will be used to help guide strategic \ndecisions across the institution, program decisions regarding outreach \ninitiatives, operational improvements and enhancements to academic \nprograms. \nThe University of Alberta has a growing positive reputation for being a \nleader enabling the sustainability transformation in higher education in \nCanada and beyond. As a result of the goals and strategies outlined in \nthe 2012 ‚Äì 2016 Sustainability Plan, the University of Alberta moved to \na Gold Rating (2014) from a Silver Rating (2012) in the Sustainability \nTracking, Assessment & Rating System.

The city‚Äôs strategic plan contains six 10-year strategic goals supported by directional plans. The plans are collectively \nknown as ‚ÄúThe Way Ahead‚Äù. These plans have a major connection to sustainability addressing topics like: infrastructure, transit, \nenvironmental sustainability, resilience, energy transition, and healthy living. The City of Edmonton recently advertised to fill the role of \nCorporate Sustainability Officer to lead their efforts.  \nGovernment of Alberta. The 2016-2019 Strategic Plan has five priorities including demonstrating leadership on climate change through \ninitiatives like waste diversion, environmental stewardship, sustainable agriculture practices, and more. They are planning progress on \nsocial sustainability ‚Äì building safe and inclusive communities. The Alberta Climate Change Office has been established to implement \nthe Climate Leadership Plan. \nGovernment of Canada. The 2016-2019 Federal Sustainable Development Strategy sets the federal government‚Äôs vision for a more \nsustainable Canada. The draft strategy highlights 5 sustainability goals with a strong emphasis on taking action on climate change, \nclean technology, connecting Canadians to nature, and protecting and restoring ecosystems. Recently the Strategic Innovation Fund \nwas released, providing up to $2 billion to improve scale or quality of facilities used for research and innovation and their environmental \nsustainability. It also acknowledges that this strategy can help support the role of the 2030 Agenda‚Äôs Sustainable Development Goals.  \nInternational Initiatives. The UN Sustainable Development Goals (officially known as Transforming our world: the 2030 Agenda \nfor Sustainable Development) are an intergovernmental set of 17 aspiration Goals with 169 targets. This plan of action for people, \nplanet and prosperity was adopted by the General Assembly (including Canada) on September 25, 2015. This was followed by Agenda \n21 which developed the concept of Education for Sustainable Development (ESD) ‚Äì promoting sustainability educational policy and \npractice. These two initiatives emphasized the growing need for sustainability awareness in higher education. UAlberta has not been \ninvolved international initiatives.  \nSustainability in Higher Education \nIn 1990, the Talloires Declaration is the first official statement from higher education. Over 350 university and college \npresidents/chancellors in over forty countries have committed their institutions to sustainability (39 Canadian institutions have signed).  \nUAlberta is not a signatory.  \nIn the past decade, sustainability efforts in higher education have become more prevalent in Canada and around the world. UAlberta \nwas a signatory to the following initiatives which seek to advance sustainability in post-secondary institutions globally: \n2010. Statement of Action. G8 University Summit, Vancouver, Canada | Link \n2009. Turin Declaration. G8 University Summit, Torino, Italy | Link \n2008. Sapporo Sustainability Declaration, G8 University Summit, Sapporo. Japan | Link \nWithin North America the Association for the Advancement of Sustainability in Higher Education leads the sustainability transformation \nin higher education. UAlberta has been a member of AASHE since 2008. Our Chief Sustainability Officer is the first Canadian to serve \non their board. There are several other international organizations helping integrate sustainability into higher education of which \nUAlberta is not a member: \n‚Ä¢ Association of University Leaders for a Sustainable Future (ULSF) \n‚Ä¢ International Sustainable Campus Network (ISCN) \n‚Ä¢ Higher Education Sustainability Initiative (HESI) \nSubmission By:  Trina Innes     \nPosition Title:  Chief Sustainability Officer \nDate: 2016-08-25 \nPage 1 of 2 \nhttp://www.edmonton.ca/city_government/city_vision_and_strategic_plan/the-way-ahead.aspx\nhttp://finance.alberta.ca/publications/budget/budget2016/goa-strategic-plan.pdf\nhttp://www.alberta.ca/climate-leadership-plan.aspx\nhttp://fsds-sfdd.ca/index.html%23/en\nhttps://www.ic.gc.ca/eic/site/051.nsf/eng/h_00002.html\nhttps://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/?menu=1300\nhttps://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/post2015/transformingourworld\nhttps://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/post2015/transformingourworld\nhttp://www.ulsf.org/talloires_declaration.html\nhttp://president.ubc.ca/files/2010/05/g8_signeddoc1.pdf\nhttp://iau-hesd.net/sites/default/files/documents/g8torino_declaration.pdf\nhttp://iau-hesd.net/sites/default/files/documents/g8.pdf\nhttp://www.aashe.org/\nhttp://www.ulsf.org/\nhttp://www.international-sustainable-campus-network.org/\nhttps://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/sdinaction/hesi\nSustainability Plan 2016-2020 \nSustainability at UAlberta \nIn 2008, the Board of Governors endorsed the university‚Äôs sustainability commitment and guiding principles and the creation of the \nOffice of Sustainability. The Office of Sustainability, under the direction of the chief sustainability officer, is the hub of the university‚Äôs \ncampus sustainability initiative. It facilitates a campus-wide network and helps inspire innovations that enhance our institution‚Äôs \nsustainability performance.  \nSince 2009, there have been three faculty members appointed to lead academic initiatives. The longest-serving director, appointed in \n2012, championed the Certificate in Sustainability, the Sustainability Scholars program, and the sustainability plan‚Äôs companion \ndocument, ‚ÄúA Plan for Deepening Sustainability Education and Scholarship at the University of Alberta: 2016-2020‚Äù. In the fall of 2016, \na team of faculty members will pilot a co-leadership approach. \nIn 2011, the office facilitated development of UAlberta‚Äôs first sustainability plan. Significant progress was made under the guidance of \nthe first 2012-2016 Sustainability Plan. Since August 2010, UAlberta has been a charter member of the Sustainability Tracking, \nAssessment & Rating System‚Ñ¢ (STARS‚Ñ¢; stars.aashe.org). In the fall of 2014, UAlberta earned a STARS Gold rating up from a \nSTARS Silver rating in 2012. The university was recognized with an Emerald Award for our waste in residence outreach initiatives, and \nhas been recognized as one of Canada‚Äôs Greenest Employers every year since 2009. Our Lister Conference Centre and Guest Suites \nhas earned 4 Green Keys under the Green Key Eco-Rating Program for hotels.  \nSustainability is identified as a major goal in UAlberta‚Äôs institutional strategic plan which was informed by the results of the consultation \nframing the new 2016-2020 Sustainability Plan and its companion document ‚ÄúA Plan for Deepening Sustainability Education and \nScholarship at the University of Alberta‚Äù. All plans summarize an array of aspirational goals, as well as strategies for attaining these \ngoals, to deepen and broaden sustainability operations, campus engagement and education at UAlberta. The expertise, leadership, \ncollective good will, program and course offerings, research and operations at UAlberta point to an enormous opportunity to inform \nsustainable thinking and practices of the future.  \n2 Issues \nGiven the strong profile of sustainability within society, the related emphasis in local, provincial, national, international governments, \nand the growth in expectations of higher education‚Äôs involvement in the movement, UAlberta has an opportunity to be recognized as a \nleader/change agent for sustainability. Work on sustainability will also help make progress on the university‚Äôs institutional strategic plan, \nassisting in our recruitment of employees and students, enhancing our reputation, building goodwill with a range of stakeholders, and \nimproving our ability to attract new forms of funding.  \nSome of the challenges associated with continuing to advance the campus sustainability initiative at UAlberta include: \n‚Ä¢ Lack of an institution-wide committee with senior representation to inspire innovation \n‚Ä¢ Inconsistent engagement of unit leaders in strategic planning and implementation \n‚Ä¢ Infusion of sustainability into academic and operational business plans \n‚Ä¢ Limited inclusion of sustainability in internal and external corporate communications and high-profile events \n‚Ä¢ Leadership turnover  \nTo transition towards sustainability our institution would benefit from treating innovation for sustainability as something to be valued. We \nneed to give leaders permission to invest time to sense what‚Äôs emerging in sustainability, to collaborate and pilot new ideas, to resolve \nrisks and perfect ideas so they can be scaled into practice.  \n3 Recommendations \nThe following are recommendations to advance sustainability at UAlberta: \n‚Ä¢ Encourage UAlberta‚Äôs senior leaders to participate in executive education for sustainability. Opportunities include: Executive \nEducation for Sustainability Leadership- Harvard (4 days), Conference Board of Canada webinars, The Natural Step, \nInternational Society of Sustainability Professionals, etc. Various certificate programs are also available. \n‚Ä¢ Establish a campus-wide sustainability committee with senior leaders members from across the institution.  \n‚Ä¢ Consider joining International Sustainable Campus Network (ISCN) and/or Higher Education Sustainability Initiative (HESI). \n‚Ä¢ Explore President‚Äôs interest in joining the Association of University Leaders for a Sustainable Future (ULSF). \n‚Ä¢ Advocate for sustainability in higher education with provincial government and pursue inclusion of sustainability in pan-\nCanadian organizations connected to higher education (e.g., U15, AUCC, CMEC, CAUBO, CAUT, etc.). \n‚Ä¢ Encourage development of unit-level sustainability plans. \nSubmission By:  Trina Innes     \nPosition Title:  Chief Sustainability Officer \nDate: 2016-08-25 \nPage 2 of 2 \nhttp://www.international-sustainable-campus-network.org/\nhttps://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/sdinaction/hesi\nhttp://www.ulsf.org/\na600 \nAUGUST 2016 \n2016-2020 \nSustainability Plan \nUniversity of Alberta Sustainability Plan 2016-2020  /  Page 2 of 30 \nThe University of Alberta respectfully acknowledges that it is located \non Treaty 6 territory.1 \n1 Footnote: Please note that this is placeholder text to be updated when the University of Alberta‚Äòs institutional \nterritorial statement is finalized by the community \nUniversity of Alberta Sustainability Plan 2016-2020  /  Page 3 of 30 \nTable of Contents \nForeword ...................................................................................................................................................................4 \nIntroduction ...............................................................................................................................................................6 \nSustainability at the University of Alberta .........................................................................................................7 \nPlanning for Sustainability ..................................................................................................................................9 \nObstacles & Opportunities ...................................................................................

We have a responsibility to ourselves, to our neighbours, \nand to the next generation, to set our brightest minds on finding solutions today.  \nWe have an opportunity within this plan to display our hard work and ingenuity to the world. Our path \nleads to clean energy, sustainable food systems, richer thinking and interdisciplinary learning, and \ninclusive communities. This is a path we can take. It is a path we must take.  \nAs we build upon the work and expertise from within this organization, I would like to thank the planning \nteam, facilitators, collaborators and all parties responsible for enacting the strategies in this plan. I have \ngreat confidence in the ability of the faculty, staff and students of this great institution to make the rapid \nprogress we need to see. \nI look forward to working with you in the years ahead in support of accomplishing these goals. \nYours sincerely, \nDavid H. Turpin, CM, PhD, LLD, FRSC \nPresident and Vice-Chancellor \nUniversity of Alberta Sustainability Plan 2016-2020  /  Page 5 of 30 \nNote from the Chief Sustainability Officer \nInspired: this is how I feel about the future of sustainability at the University of Alberta.  \nI joined the University of Alberta in 2009 as the inaugural director of the Office of Sustainability. Since \nthen, I have had the opportunity to work with many leaders championing the campus sustainability \ninitiative across the university. Together, we have accomplished a lot.  \nThe university has made major progress on sustainability, including: introducing an embedded \nsustainability certificate for undergraduate students, accelerating the implementation of the energy \nmanagement program, recognizing spaces for their sustainability actions, launching our greenhouse \ngas management plan, and growing engagement of students, faculty and staff in sustainability \ninitiatives. Together we have achieved a Gold Rating in the Sustainability Tracking, Assessment and \nRating System‚Ñ¢‚Äîan accomplishment to be very proud of.  \nAs we move beyond thinking solely about organizational efficiencies, people are recognizing the \ninterconnections of sustainability. We are thinking about the environment and the economy, and \nexpanding our thinking to include aspects of justice, health, well-being and other values. More and \nmore people are embracing their role as change agents and working together to integrate sustainability \ninto the culture of our institution.  \nThroughout the development of this plan, we have listened to the campus community, improved our \nunderstanding of the challenges and opportunities before us, and sought out ways to collaborate and \nimprove our institution‚Äôs position as a national model for sustainability.  \nWhether you‚Äôre interested in taking courses, getting involved in hands-on learning experiences, piloting \nnew ideas, or conducting research using our campus as a living lab, there are many ways for you to \nparticipate in this plan and develop innovative solutions that better the planet. Together our students, \nfaculty and staff have the talents needed to advance our sustainability ambitions and to develop \ntomorrow‚Äôs sustainability leaders.  \nI am looking forward to working with you as we gain fresh momentum towards building a sustainable \nfuture!  \nTrina Innes, MF, MBA, ICD.D \nChief Sustainability Officer \nUniversity of Alberta Sustainability Plan 2016-2020  /  Page 6 of 30 \nIntroduction \nWe are living in a world that is changing rapidly. Patterns of development and consumption are \ndegrading the global resource base and reducing the quality of physical and social environments. \nGovernments, business, organizations and academic institutions are all recognizing that the imperative \nof taking actions to develop a sustainable society. \nSustainability is about meeting the needs of the world without compromising the ability of future \ngenerations to meet their needs. It requires holistic approaches that strive to achieve balance between \necological, social and economic environments in perpetuity. There is no single blueprint for \nsustainability. Every nation, city, organization and individual needs to understand and respond to the \nunique pressures they face from climate change, resource scarcity, pollution, and other issues related \nto local capacity, economics, social justice, health and well-being. Sustainability moves towards a \nglobal society founded on respect for nature, human rights, economic justice and peace. \nThere is growing international consensus that higher education has a responsibility to drive processes \nthat make the world a better place.  Universities are uniquely positioned to catalyze innovations for \nsustainability through our operations, and the traditional missions of education, research and service. \nUniversities are increasingly recognizing the need for graduating students with the attitudes, skills, \nperspectives and knowledge needed to make informed decisions and create solutions to address global \nchallenges.   \nThe University of Alberta embraces the opportunity to shape and strengthen sustainability and will \ncontinue to build upon our past accomplishments and support the university‚Äôs goal of integrating \nsustainability into our academic, research and engagement activities. \nThis sustainability plan takes a multi-pronged approach to formalizing how the University of Alberta will \ntake action for sustainability. It provides members of our community with a sense of purpose, direction \nand energy in the form of aspirational and strategic goals that guide our progress to 2020 as resources \ncome available. Although much is being done within all facets of the university, this plan draws attention \nto selected strategies that are currently under way or planned to help transform our institution. Some \nstrategies involve quick wins and incremental changes to existing practices. Other strategies may \nrequire longer-term financial and intellectual investments leading to changes in policies and practices.   \nMaking progress will demand consideration of a diverse range of initiatives and continuous innovation \nwhile maintaining the flexibility to recalibrate in response to other pressures, complexities and risks \nfacing post-secondary education.   It is considered a living document to be reviewed, questioned and \nadjusted periodically and in response to opportunities.  \nOur success will draw upon the collective and collaborative efforts of the over 55,000 faculty, staff, and \nstudents in our campus community, working together to advance our institution‚Äôs mission of ‚Äúuplifting \nthe whole people‚Äù.  \nUniversity of Alberta Sustainability Plan 2016-2020  /  Page 7 of 30 \nSustainability at the University of Alberta \nSince 1975, there have been significant achievements towards building a sustainable future at the \nUniversity of Alberta. A university-wide sustainability initiative was launched in 2008, the university‚Äôs \ncentenary year. The Office of Sustainability was opened in 2009 to serve as the hub of the initiative, \nwhich seeks to inform, inspire and enable students, faculty and staff to adopt sustainable practices. The \nfocus areas of the initiative are: outreach & engagement, teaching & research, and facilities & \noperations. These areas largely mirror the categories used by the Sustainability Tracking, Assessment \nand Rating System‚Ñ¢ (STARS¬Æ), which is used to measure and report on our institution‚Äôs sustainability \nperformance. \nIn 2011, the university developed its first Sustainability Plan (it was \nreleased in 2012). The plan included broad input from the campus \ncommunity, including the voices of students, staff and faculty. \nContributors included administrative units and committees, as well \nas the award-winning Deliberation on Campus Sustainability \nProject. 2 Since the release of the first Sustainability Plan, the \nuniversity has made progress on sustainability by: \n‚Ä¢ Developing a Greenhouse Gas Emissions Reduction Plan \n‚Ä¢ Launching the Envision energy management program \n‚Ä¢ Certifying new and existing buildings for sustainability \nfeatures and performance \n‚Ä¢ Increasing the amount of waste diverted from landfills \n‚Ä¢ Launching the Certificate in Sustainability for undergraduate \nstudents \n‚Ä¢ Initiating the Green Spaces Certification Program for residences, \nlabs, food vendors, offices and events \n‚Ä¢ Creating working groups for waste diversion & sustainable \npurchasing \nThe university has been recognized as one of Canada‚Äôs Greenest Employer every year since 2009 and \nwas recognized with an Emerald Award in 2014 for waste outreach programs.  \nSustainability is an important component of the University of Alberta‚Äôs Institutional Strategic Plan. The \nSustainability Plan provides more information about our institution‚Äôs ambitions and invites the campus \ncommunity to collaborate and coordinate their efforts to build upon the innovations and solutions of \nfaculties, administrative units and students‚Äô associations.  \nSustainability is an approach that requires consideration  of our current and ever-changing social and \nenvironmental needs. This plan provides goalposts to measure progress in the right direction and \nshows consideration for economic, social and environmental performance (also known as the triple-\nbottom-line). \n2 2012 Case Study Award, Association for the Advancement of Sustainability in Higher Education \nUAlberta‚Äôs Sustainability \nAccomplishments \nTo learn more about \naccomplishments between \n2012 and 2015, read the \nCampus Sustainability \nInitiatives Report 2012-15. \nhttp://sustainability.ualberta.ca/climate\nhttp://sustainability.ualberta.ca/certificate\nhttp://sustainability.ualberta.ca/greenspaces\nhttp://issuu.com/officeofsustainability/docs/campus_initiative_report_v3e__singl?e=7210898/30112291\nhttp://issuu.com/officeofsustainability/docs/campus_initiative_report_v3e__singl?e=7210898/30112291\nUniversity of Alberta Sustainability Plan 2016-2020  /  Page 8 of 30 \nUniversity of Alberta Sustainability Plan 2016-2020  /  Page 9 of 30 \nPlanning for Sustainability \nIn 2016, the University of Alberta unveiled the institutional strategic plan, ‚ÄúFor The Public Good‚Äù.

It is developed by the \nAssociation for the Advancement of Sustainability in Higher Education (AASHE¬Æ). It is fully transparent \nand enables meaningful comparison of our performance over time, and benchmarking of our institution \nagainst others through a common set of measurements.  \nUsing STARS¬Æ is an appropriate, standard way to track our progress on the sustainability plan and our \njourney towards sustainability. Reporting is comprehensive, covering \nAcademics, Engagement, Operations and Planning & Administration. \nSTARS¬Æ is updated frequently, challenging even the highest-\nperforming institutions to strive for continuous improvement.  \nThe Office of Sustainability collaborates with representatives from \nacross the university to prepare an updated STARS¬Æ submission \nevery two to three years. Regular reporting keeps stakeholders across \nthe institution engaged with new strategies that fill gaps in our \nperformance.  \nIn October 2014, the University of Alberta received a STARS Gold \nrating. \nEighteen Canadian schools hold a rating in the 1.X versions of STARS¬Æ. Of these, the University of \nAlberta achieved the highest score under Education & Research as well as Planning, Administration \nand Engagement. Only four other Canadian institutions have received Gold ratings in these versions. At \nthe time of our last submission, the University of Alberta achieved the second-highest rating in Canada. \nThe university previously received a STARS¬Æ Silver rating in 2012.  \nSustainability performance will be assessed in 2016/17 and once again before this plan expires, using \nSTARS¬Æ and feedback collected from a range of responsible parties.  \nRead the University of \nAlberta‚Äôs 2014 STARS \nsubmission and the \nCampus Sustainability \nInitiatives Report 2012-\n15 for more. \nhttps://stars.aashe.org/institutions/university-of-alberta-ab/report/2014-10-10/\nhttps://stars.aashe.org/institutions/university-of-alberta-ab/report/2014-10-10/\nhttp://issuu.com/officeofsustainability/docs/campus_initiative_report_v3e__singl?e=7210898/30112291\nhttp://issuu.com/officeofsustainability/docs/campus_initiative_report_v3e__singl?e=7210898/30112291\nhttp://issuu.com/officeofsustainability/docs/campus_initiative_report_v3e__singl?e=7210898/30112291\nUniversity of Alberta Sustainability Plan 2016-2020  /  Page 24 of 30 \nNext Steps \nMoving forward, the Office of Sustainability will provide services \nto help change agents achieve our institution‚Äôs sustainability \ngoals and strategies.

Vision (January/February 2015): The exploratory phase sought to understand our shared vision \nfor campus sustainability in the year 2020. Participants were asked ‚ÄúWhat does sustainability at \nthe University of Alberta look like in 2020?‚Äù \n2. Obstacles and Strategies (March/April 2015): The focused dialogue asked participants to \nsuggest ways of overcoming obstacles and developing strategies to help realize our shared \nvision in the next five years. Participants were asked ‚ÄúWhat can we do to address our obstacles \nand achieve our vision for 2020?‚Äù \n3. Campus-Wide Review (Fall 2015): The draft plan, including accountability measures and \nreporting methodology, was shared for university-wide review and feedback. \n4. Action Planning (Spring 2016 onward): For each strategy, key individuals responsible for the \nuniversity‚Äôs sustainability performance are offered the opportunity to use action planning tools to \ndevelop tactical plans.  \nParticipation \nThe University of Alberta community answered the call to play a direct role in the planning process \nthrough a variety of mechanisms. In addition to invitations targeting individuals with key responsibilities, \nopen invitations to participate were shared with 1,534 people during 6 outreach events. \nUniversity of Alberta Sustainability Plan 2016-2020  /  Page 26 of 30 \nOver 600 undergraduate and graduate students, non-academic staff, faculty, professional staff, senior \nadministrators, alumni and community members were actively engaged in the process, including:  \n‚Ä¢ ~400 individuals participated in 33 facilitated workshops  \n‚Ä¢ ~100 individual or group interviews \n‚Ä¢ ~90 people completed the online community conversation kit  \n‚Ä¢ ~ 70 group consultations/committees  \n‚Ä¢ ~70 departments, faculties, units and organizations  \nDuring the process we promoted transparency by communicating regularly, access to the process and \nfeedback through: \n‚Ä¢ sustainability plan website \n‚Ä¢ face-to-face meetings \n‚Ä¢ 17 background/progress documents \n‚Ä¢ 64 workshop reports \n‚Ä¢ open house \nThe results of this consultation process were used to help inform development of the University of \nAlberta‚Äôs institutional strategic plan and led to the inclusion of sustainability as an institution-wide \nstrategic goal.  \nThe successful implementation of this plan will build upon the relationships established with individuals \nand groups engaged in this planning process. \nObstacles and Challenges \nTo develop the most effective sustainability plan, we must consider our place and our context. The \nfollowing obstacles and opportunities for sustainability were derived during the consultation process, \nand were given consideration while framing the goals and strategies in this plan. \nLack of Resources: Concerned that the availability of resources (including labour, finances and time) \nmay inhibit the progress of sustainability-related programs, initiatives and action.  \nUncertainty: Changes to the political climate, economy and the involvement of external stakeholders \ncreate competing interests for limited resources.  \nCulture: Competition in society is seen as something that drives excellence and can inhibit \ncollaboration and progress towards community well-being and sustainability. Collaboration is required \nto achieve collective impact. Many people have a regimented perspective on educational outcomes, \nwhich hinders the progress on non-traditional learning outcomes such as global citizenship and training \nof students as social change agents. \nUniversity of Alberta Sustainability Plan 2016-2020  /  Page 27 of 30 \nChange Management: The university is large and complex. The approaches required to advance our \nsustainability performance cannot be homogeneous; they will need to be adjusted for each group and \ninitiative.  \nOpportunities & Keys to Success \nParticipants identified the following points as worthy of note for improving the university‚Äôs sustainability \nperformance. These keys to success are to be considered by everyone when implementing the goals \nand strategies outlined in this plan: \nLeadership Support: In order to achieve our sustainability goals, support and direction from senior \nleadership is critical. Leaders are essential in establishing sustainability as a priority for our institution \nand ensuring that sustainability is integrated into our business planning.  \nAccountability: Every individual should be responsible for the University of Alberta‚Äôs sustainability \nprogress. We all play a role in our resource use, programming and our work as advocates.  There are \npotential collaborators identified for every goal and strategy outlined in this plan.  \nCollaboration: Partnerships and effective collaboration are important to achieve sustainability goals. \nThere should be strong collaboration across faculties and central units for the identification of shared \npriorities, communication, programming and engagement of students in curriculum and research, \nwhenever possible.  \nCommunication: Open and frequent communication among those active in achieving our sustainability \ngoals is required. This includes effective internal strategic communication and outreach to our target \naudiences. Accessible and clear messaging, based on reliable research, should be used for all \nsustainability-related programming. \nMonitoring & Measurement: It is important to treat strategic plans as living documents that are \nrevisited frequently by all responsible parties in order for us to measure our performance and use this \ninformation to guide future efforts. Being transparent and public about this process provides legitimacy \nand enables improved sustainability performance.  \nUniversity of Alberta Sustainability Plan 2016-2020  /  Page 28 of 30 \nAppendix B - Acknowledgements \nExecutive Champions  \nThe executive champions for the sustainability planning process were Don Hickey, Vice President \n(Facilities & Operations) and Dr. Wendy Rodgers, Deputy Provost.

They generate and share \ninspiration, ideas, knowledge, and visions of pathways for change, all of which are needed to create a \nmore sustainable world. The University of Alberta is in a particularly strong place to address the \nchallenges of sustainability, or a stronger shift in societies across the world for long-term change that \nsupports the health, vitality and resilience in the social-ecological system. The expertise, leadership, \ncollective good will, program and course offerings, and research at the University of Alberta point to an \nenormous opportunity to inform multi-faceted ways of thinking and doing that shape sustainability.  \nThere is no discipline, no professor, no student who is not touched by the constraints and opportunities \nthat exist in a world with more clearly recognized limits in resources, needs for human capital and \ncreativity, and ways to cooperate and organize to meet collective goals. This report summarizes an \narray of ideas to deepen and broaden sustainability education and scholarship at the University of \nAlberta that were brought forward by University of Alberta professors, administrative leaders, students, \nstudent leaders and alumni. There is energy and commitment to pursue these ideas, and the time is \nripe to strengthen our role as a higher educational institution that helps build a better future for all.  \n‚ÄúWhatever we do now is going to influence the future, and probably more the future of our students than \nour own futures. We are going to make an impact that we may never actually see and that we may never \nhear about. That‚Äôs why doing this matters. That‚Äôs what teaching is: you stand in front of a classroom or in \nfront of a computer, and you are influencing people who may never come back and tell you that you‚Äôve \nmade a difference. You trust that it sometimes happens, because we know that it does. It‚Äôs appropriate \nthat we do this at the University.‚Äù \n- Christie Schultz, Assistant Dean, Academic, Faculty of Extension \nA Plan for Deepening Sustainability Education and Scholarship   /  Page 4 of 34 \nBackground \nThis is an academic companion document to the University of Alberta‚Äôs Sustainability Plan (2016-\n2020). It provides information about the goals and strategies that were suggested to guide sustainability \nin education and research at the University of Alberta and that will connect to the overall campus \nsustainability initiative. \nThe University of Alberta‚Äôs Board of Governor‚Äôs endorsed the University‚Äôs sustainability commitment \nand guiding principles in 2008. Subsequently, sustainability was featured as a companion element to \nthe last academic plan and a key component of the last sustainability plan. In 2015, the University of \nAlberta began the thinking that will lay the foundation for the next 5 to 10 years under our new president \nDavid Turpin.  This report compliments the University of Alberta‚Äôs Comprehensive Institutional Plan \n(2016) which calls for a sustainability commitment in planning documents and building projects.   It is \nhoped and anticipated that this report will help inform the University of Alberta‚Äôs commitment to \nsustainability education and scholarship.    \nThe goals and strategies in this document originated from several consultations and workshops held \nbetween October 2014 and February 2016: \n‚Ä¢ Workshop on October 17, 2014 on ‚ÄúSustainability, Environment and Social Justice in the Social \nSciences and Humanities at the University of Alberta‚Äù with 22 professors in the social sciences, \narts and humanities. This workshop was part of the Provost‚Äôs Initiatives and it was supported by \nthe Kule Institute of Advanced Studies and the Office of Sustainability. \n‚Ä¢ Sustainability Plan workshops on education and research with two groups: 1) the Office of \nSustainability Academic Advisory Committee (OSAAC)1, and 2) a group composed of \nundergraduate and graduate students, non-academic staff, faculty, professional staff, alumni \nand community members. Each group attended a Vision workshop that sought to understand \nour shared vision for sustainability in education and research at the University of Alberta in \n2020. Participants subsequently attended an Obstacles and Strategies workshop to look for \nways to overcome obstacles and develop strategies to help the University of Alberta realize our \nshared vision in the next five years. \n‚Ä¢ Several individual consultations with faculty Deans, Associate Deans, representatives, program \nchairs, centre directors, and graduate and undergraduate student groups to obtain additional \nsuggestions on how to deepen and broaden sustainability education and scholarship at the \nUniversity of Alberta.2 \n‚Ä¢ Luncheon Discussion on February 29, 2016 on Academic Initiatives in Sustainability at the \nUniversity of Alberta \n1 In spring 2015, the Office of Sustainability Academic Advisory Committee (OSAAC) was renamed the Provost's Academic \nAdvisory Council on Sustainability (PAACS). \n2 Appendix A provides additional details about these workshops and consultations. Appendix B lists the participants who \nwere involved in the consultation process. \nA Plan for Deepening Sustainability Education and Scholarship   /  Page 5 of 34 \nOne of the key challenges that came out of these consultations is the need to change the perception \nheld by some of the faculty, students and staff that sustainability is only about improving the \nenvironment. A broad definition of sustainability is applied to the goals and strategies in this plan: \n‚ÄúSustainability is the process of living within the limits of available physical, natural and social resources in \nways that allow the living systems in which humans are embedded to thrive in perpetuity.‚Äù \n- Academic Advisory Committee Working Definition, Office of Sustainability, 2010 \nThis definition addresses the ability for individual, social, ecological, economic, health and cultural \nsystems to thrive and exist within the limits of the ecosystem sustenance base upon which all life \ndepends. Professors and students in professional programs with stringent accreditation requirements, \nsuch as Law, Rehabilitative Medicine, Pharmacy, and Medicine and Dentistry, appear to recognize \nthemselves less in the concept of teaching and researching in sustainability, yet they play a critical role \nin the health, design, and social justice systems of society. Students in particular may not readily \nrecognize that sustainability is the healthy functioning of society and an economic system that supports \nthe well-being of all. \nThe following two sections outline a vision for education and research at the University of Alberta that \ncame out of the Sustainability Plan consultations, along with suggested goals and strategies to help \nattain that vision. The Goals and Strategies section uses the same numbering system as the Education \n& Research section in the University of Alberta‚Äôs draft Sustainability Plan (2016-2020). The main \nheadings are the key goals (Goals 2.1 to 2.3), and the strategies associated with each of these goals \nare included in bold text beneath them. Additional background information from workshops and \nindividual consultations is provided below each strategy. This information provides context useful for \nguiding the implementation of the strategies and for strengthening connections across the University. \nAfter Goals and Strategies, Next Steps discusses the process for sharing content in ‚ÄúA Plan for \nDeepening Sustainability Education and Scholarship at the University of Alberta 2016-2020‚Äù. This is \nfollowed by a final note about the future of sustainability in education and research at the University of \nAlberta. \nA Plan for Deepening Sustainability Education and Scholarship   /  Page 6 of 34 \nVisions for Education & Research3 \nWe envision students having opportunities to learn, research and apply sustainability using \ninterdisciplinary approaches. Through outreach and partnerships, the university brings research and \nnew knowledge to the community, enabling individuals, communities, organizations and industries to \nachieve sustainability. The university is recognized as a leader for taking significant action on climate \nchange and for capitalizing on the knowledge and strengths of our academic and research \ncommunities. \n3 The draft Sustainability Plan (2016-2020) describes the process used to create this vision statement.  \nA Plan for Deepening Sustainability Education and Scholarship   /  Page 7 of 34 \nGoals and Strategies \nThe goals and strategies provided below are identified with numbers that match with goals and \nstrategies identified in the University of Alberta‚Äôs 2016-2020 Sustainability Plan, Section 2, Education & \nResearch.  \nGoal 2.1 Encourage the campus community and the public to learn about sustainability \na. Strategy: Create awareness of resources, research findings, demonstration projects and \nexpertise. \nOne approach is to prompt broader learning about sustainability through the offering of the University of \nAlberta‚Äôs varied embedded undergraduate certificates. There are several embedded certificates at the \nUniversity of Alberta that are either current or in development. The new Certificate in Sustainability is \navailable to undergraduate students in nine faculties, including the Augustana campus. Augustana also \noffers a Certificate in Sustainability as part of five one-day courses through their Extended Education \nprogram. Other options with connections to sustainability at the University of Alberta include the \nundergraduate Certificate in International Learning, the Certificate in Community Engagement and \nService-Learning, and the Certificate in Global Citizenship. The Faculty of Science is developing a \nCertificate in Leadership with the Faculty of Arts, as well as a Certificate in Interdisciplinary Science \nStudies and a Research Certificate in Science. There has also been discussion on moving forward with \nAdapted Fitness Provider Certification (embedded and free-standing) in the Faculty of Physical \nEducation and Recreation that would serve to support students, new graduates and exercise \nprofessionals in the community to learn ways to adapt physical activity and exercise for individuals \nexperiencing disability. There is potential and public interest in a professional certificate, offered by the \nFaculty of Extension, in Sustainability or a more focused area (e.g. Climate Change Policy and \nPractice) for post-graduates. \nGraduate students (incoming and outgoing elected members of the Graduate Student Association) \nsuggested developing a Sustainability Certificate for graduate students that is practicum- and research-\nbased, rather than course-based. They suggested creating more professional development \nopportunities tied to sustainability and offering online, for-credit professional development courses. An \nexample of such a course could be a credit course on green building certification (the Faculty of \nExtension currently offers this as a non-credit course). They would also like to see sustainability-related \nevents and learning opportunities across the disciplines. This could include team-based graduate \nstudent research opportunities to work on wicked problems (i.e., hard-to-solve problems that are \ninterconnected with other problems). \nMassive open online courses (MOOCs) could make sustainability curriculum more accessible to \nstudents limited by mobility, work schedules, and living in remote areas. Examples of forthcoming \nMOOCs at the University of Alberta include: Indigenous Studies 101 (Faculty of Native Studies), \nIntroduction to the Arctic: Climate (Faculty of Science), Mountains 101 (an interdisciplinary course in \nthe Faculty of Physical Education and Recreation), and other Arctic courses that will focus on People \nand Cultures, Economics and Natural Resources (Faculty of Science). Potential future MOOCs, such \nas ‚ÄúTransitions to Sustainability‚Äù and ‚ÄúClimate Change Policy, Practice and Programs‚Äù, could offer more \nA Plan for Deepening Sustainability Education and Scholarship   /  Page 8 of 34 \ndirect sustainability learning. The Faculty of Nursing would like to offer a future MOOC on nutrition and \nexercise, which are also key subjects for sustainable social systems. \nGreater access to sustainability education through the University of Alberta could also include more \nonline courses, as well as course-based Master‚Äôs degrees (both online and on campus) in related areas \nof sustainability, to broaden and deepen sustainability learning. The Faculty of Nursing is particularly \ninterested in online sustainability courses that could be offered to their nursing students as electives. \nThere are several Master‚Äôs programs that are currently being developed at the University of Alberta. \nFor example, the Faculty of Science is developing a professional Master‚Äôs degree in Environmental \nMonitoring or Environmental Innovation. The Faculty of Science is also waiting for approval of a course-\nbased Master‚Äôs in Planning. The Faculty of Agricultural, Life and Environmental Sciences is developing \nan interdisciplinary, course-based, distance learning (online) Master‚Äôs program in Forestry, and \nEcological Restoration and Reclamation. The Faculty of Native Studies is working on an online, course-\nbased Master‚Äôs in Native Studies.  \nb. Strategy: Promote sustainability-related programs. \nThe University of Alberta could train those who regularly interact with current and prospective students \nabout the curricular and co-curricular opportunities to learn about sustainability at the University of \nAlberta. For example, campus recruiters, internship coordinators and career advisors could more \nstrongly promote our sustainability-related academic, co-curricular and engagement programs. \nThose who we consulted with often held that making out-of-the-classroom opportunities for learning \nabout sustainability should be accessible and affordable to all students. Promotion of these \nopportunities may include reaching out through the Students‚Äô Union and targeting student clubs and \norganizations on campus where uptake is likely to be strong. Graduate students asked for better \ncommunication among departments, graduate coordinators who advise students on courses, and the \nGraduate Student Association on new course offerings in sustainability. \nc. Strategy: Encourage diverse educational approaches to teach about sustainability across the \ndisciplines.  \nMany people recommended that the leaders of the University of Alberta encourage the development of \nnew courses in sustainability and the integration of sustainability concepts and applications into existing \ncourses. The development of sustainability content and courses could be encouraged by offering \ncourse releases to build new courses or to substantially revise existing courses. Funding could be \nprovided for pilot projects, course field trips, or special learning and training opportunities for faculty. \nFor example, faculty could receive funds to attend the annual conference of the Association for the \nAdvancement of Sustainability in Higher Education, which provides rich learning opportunities on \nsustainability course content and delivery. An example of an interdisciplinary course being developed \nby the Faculties of Arts and Science is a global issues course to address the connections between \nscience and society.  \nSome professors argued for more flexibility in pedagogical structure. Blended learning would reduce \nutility use, because roughly half of the learning is done outside the classroom. Flipped classrooms are \nclasses that physically meet less frequently to focus on exercises, projects or discussions. Massive \nopen online courses (MOOCs) are courses that people can take remotely, thus eliminating travel to and \nA Plan for Deepening Sustainability Education and Scholarship   /  Page 9 of 34 \nfrom class. Finally, alterations to class duration and frequency can better enable students to take \ncourses outside of their disciplines and enable instructors to involve outside experts. \nStrong interest exists in topics such as sustainable businesses, technological advances in energy \nsavings and renewable energy, and science citizenship, yet the courses that are available are generally \nlimited to students who are in those majors (e.g. Engineering, Business and Science). There is an \nopportunity to deepen and broaden sustainability learning by developing courses for non-majors. \nGraduate students in particular asked for more opportunities to take sustainability-focused courses.  \nProject challenges and competitions that are hosted by faculties or broader units and posed to student-\nled groups could create a greater sense of efficacy and hope among students interested in \nsustainability. For example, the Heroes for Health challenge previously held by the by the University of \nAlberta‚Äôs Health and Wellness team could be repeated in a Heroes for Sustainability competition. \nMany participants in our consultations suggested having a long-range goal that all programs provide \nexperiential learning opportunities involving systems and long-term thinking. For example, there is \nbroad academic support for a new initiative called Learning Experiences in Applied Projects (LEAP), led \nby the Office of Sustainability. LEAP creates opportunities for problem-based teaching, research and \nhands-on experiences. These ‚Äúliving lab‚Äù projects use the natural, social and built environment of the \ncampus as a testing ground to develop solutions to address sustainability goals on campus and \nbeyond. \nSeveral professors and leaders recommended that we teach sustainability through university \nprogramming in outdoor education, health, play, cultural events, storytelling, and the arts. When \nstudents come to know the University‚Äôs campuses not only as places for classroom learning, but also \nas places with natural features that are aesthetically pleasing (e.g. Edmonton‚Äôs River Valley), places for \noutside unstructured learning, and places for creative expression, there is greater opportunity to tap into \nlocal capacity to see the value in nature and in place-based knowledge and talent. It was recommended \nthat we should continue to invest in the natural beauty and ecosystem functioning of our university \ngrounds and use this management knowledge as a teaching tool for students.  \nMany faculty members suggested that promoting our Education Abroad program, which offers \nexchange, internship and summer programs, can further enhance experiential learning tied to \nsustainability. Other international spring, reading week or semester-long courses at the University can \nbroaden students‚Äô international learning of sustainability, particularly around cultural sustainability.  \nThe widespread adoption of a healthy lifestyle is an important component of social sustainability. The \nFaculty of Physical Education and Recreation (PER) has extensive programming for university and \ncommunity members that promotes health and wellness. This includes activities and courses with an \noutdoor component (such as INT D 284: Mountain Backcountry Field Skills). The Faculty of PER also \nprovides opportunities for numerous activities in the facilities that they manage. This faculty is also \nbuilding a new major in Adaptive Physical Activity within their Bachelor of Kinesiology that addresses \nproviding greater opportunity and access to physical activity and sport to those with disabilities. The \nPhysical Education and Recreation faculty could also highlight better their teaching contributions in the \narea of sustainability around behavioural medicine, recreation and health education, which promotes \nhealthy behaviours among diverse populations.  \nA Plan for Deepening Sustainability Education and Scholarship   /  Page 10 of 34 \nGoal 2.2 Encourage exposure to interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary teaching and \nresearch connected to sustainability.  \nInterdisciplinary and transdisciplinary teaching and research require building bridges within and outside \nof the university. Several people who were consulted asserted that greater dialogue about the role of \nhigher education in advancing teaching, research, demonstration projects, interventions, and outreach \non sustainability is needed to build shared understanding among faculty and students about the \nmeaning and importance of sustainability. Departments, faculties, and academic program chairs are \nencouraged to engage in University and community dialogues about where academic needs are likely \nto change, in terms of important topics, methodologies, technologies, and changing socio-political \ncontexts that will shift local, national and global conditions for sustainability. We could place further \nemphasis on professors‚Äô engagement with the broader community of government, industry, faith-based \norganizations, non-governmental organizations, indigenous organizations, and other civic and \ncommunity organizations on the perceived needs for sustainability research. The consultations for this \nplan indicated an abiding interest in sustainable food systems, climate change mitigation and \nadaptation, energy conservation, cultural sustainability, and sustainable consumption.  \nTo meet Goal 2.2, the number of instructors, students and researchers involved with or exposed to \ninterdisciplinary or transdisciplinary teaching and research connected to sustainability would also likely \nincrease. Some universities have chosen to require a 100-level course in sustainability for all students. \nWhile this would be challenging in some programs that have less room for non-required courses in their \naccreditation standards, a required sustainability course could create common ground across \ndisciplines and showcase a distinct commitment to sustainability education at the University of Alberta. \nSuch a course could be delivered online or through a MOOC.  \nAugustana has a core requirement for environmental sustainability. The Faculty of Science is \ndeveloping a first-year course on critical thinking and weighing evidence for all incoming science \nstudents. This will foster common knowledge among science students and help them understand \npotential applications of science.  \nThere was a common recommendation for more place- and project-based teaching, which may be \nmore easily taught across the University of Alberta‚Äôs campuses, field stations, research facilities, and \ndemonstration projects. We have an opportunity to use our university as a sandbox, providing \nopportunities for creative and collaborative exploration. Greater linkages between the Prairie Urban \nFarm at South Campus and the Devonian Botanic Garden, for example, could complement a growing \ninterest and concern in sustainable food systems. This could also include strengthening their \nconnections to the University‚Äôs operational activities (e.g. Dining Services). More use could be made of \nAugustana‚Äôs Miquelon Lake Research Station, which aspires to demonstrate sustainable operations \nand carry out teaching and research in sustainability. Greater flexibility for students to take \nsustainability courses outside of their degrees or to pursue a minor in sustainability in their respective \nprograms would broaden exposure to sustainability topics across the majors. Graduate students would \nlike the concepts of sustainability to be more widely incorporated into their courses, research training, \nand professional development opportunities. \na. Strategy: Build the capacity to include aspects of diversity and inclusivity within research, \nand honour diverse research methods.  \nA Plan for Deepening Sustainability Education and Scholarship   /  Page 11 of 34 \nThose consulted for this report often called for greater integration of Aboriginal content into courses \nacross the University of Alberta to improve general knowledge about the recommendations of the Truth \nand Reconciliation Commission of Canada4, the current threats to sustainability across Canada, and \nthe ways in which indigenous peoples of Canada have maintained or sought sustainability in their \ncommunities. University of Alberta North, a new initiative to coordinate northern research initiatives, can \nfacilitate this capacity, especially in terms of building northern research capacity. Augustana has shown \ncommitment in this area with the recent hire of a new professor who links sustainability to History and \nNative Studies. Others in the Faculty of Native Studies recommended exposing students, faculty and \nstaff to the relationship between sustainability and traditional knowledge in native communities in \nCanada and elsewhere. In particular, the Faculty of Native Studies suggested offering more courses \nrelated to collaborative research skills to build land-based knowledge, and indigenous rights and \nbenefits with respect to resource development. \nThe Faculty of Physical Education and Research suggested that they are in a good position to teach \nhow to design spaces and be sensitive to diversity and inclusivity in various work and play settings. The \nFaculty of Physical Education and Recreation is also considering purchasing a property that would \nallow on-the-land training related to mountain studies, outdoor recreation, physical adaptations, sports \ntraining and performance, and other learning modules related to natural areas. Greater connections \nbetween the Faculty of Physical Education and Recreation and Human Resource Services or the \nEmployment Equity Advisory Committee (EEAC) could foster greater in-house collaborations on \nsustainability. \nFinally, University leaders can influence the funding of sustainability research by advocating for \nappropriate reviewers for research grants, as there is a sense that most internal grant applications are \nreviewed by those in strict disciplines who may not appreciate the interdisciplinary nature of \nsustainability research. \nb. Strategy: Celebrate professors with a stated commitment to and/or expertise in sustainability.  \nMany of our participants recommended that the University of Alberta showcase faculty, alumni and \nresearch teams that demonstrate excellence in advancing sustainability knowledge, practices, policies \nor projects. For example, the Office of Sustainability periodically showcases a professor who carries out \nsustainability research and/or teaching under the banner ‚ÄúFaces of Sustainability.‚Äù The University home \npage could also showcase professors, graduate students and professional staff members who make \noutstanding contributions to sustainability scholarship, education, programming or operations. \nIt is striking how many professors in the social sciences, arts and humanities are shifting their research \nfocus to sustainable food systems, investigating areas like food justice, food sovereignty, food security \nand sustainable agriculture. Other strong areas of interest include: rural community development \n(especially at Augustana), sustainable energy systems, cold climate and resource-based economy \n4 The Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada (TRC) was constituted and created by the Indian Residential Schools \nSettlement Agreement. The Commission travelled throughout Canada over a period of six years to hear from Aboriginal \npeople who had been taken from their families as children and placed in residential schools. In 2015, the Commission \nsubmitted its final report, which can be downloaded from http://nctr.ca/reports.php.  \nhttp://nctr.ca/reports.php\nA Plan for Deepening Sustainability Education and Scholarship   /  Page 12 of 34 \nsustainable design (especially in circumpolar regions), health and wellness, and governance and \nplanning of cities and landscapes (including cumulative impact assessment and biodiversity protection).  \nMany of those we consulted also recommended that the University of Alberta increase the numbers of \nprofessors with expertise in sustainability and strategically hire new professors with a demonstrated \ninterest in areas like climate change and corporate social sustainability. Faculties and departments \ncould also create awards and scholarships for sustainability and promote creative engagement \nbetween faculty and students on sustainability topics suitable for that faculty, as the Alberta School of \nBusiness has done with its student group, Net Impact.  \nc. Strategy: Create opportunities to connect colleagues with a stated commitment to and/or \nexpertise in sustainability.  \nOne common suggestion to foster greater opportunities for colleagues with a stated commitment to \nsustainability is to create a sustainability centre or related public policy institute focused on curriculum \nand research initiatives. Such a centre could provide programming for public policy, for specific \nprofessional programs, or for a summer immersive experience in sustainability. This centre or institute \ncould carry out a number of integrative programs to build capacity in sustainability education and \nscholarship at the University of Alberta. Representatives from the Faculty of Arts and the Faculty of \nLaw, in particular, asserted the need for a place in which academics across faculties who are interested \nin sustainability could more easily collaborate with one other and coordinate sustainability-related \nprojects. Efforts to promote such a centre should build on the lessons to be learned from the Alberta \nCentre for Sustainable Rural Communities at Augustana, and liase with this Institute as appropriate.  \nThe institute could host University of Alberta professors who are seconded to be part of the institute for \none to three years to lead academic sustainability initiatives. It could also host think tanks or \nsustainability scholars from other universities. This institute could hold events such as ‚Äúinterdisciplinary \nspeed dating‚Äù or ‚Äúdesign and policy charrettes‚Äù on sustainability topics with students across the \ndisciplines. There could also be panel discussions that link sustainability researchers (professors, \nundergraduate students and graduate students) and encourage them to share their research on \ncommon topics of interest and to develop research clusters in areas such as climate change. This \ninstitute would bring people together and build bridges across the disciplines to encourage scholarship \nthat informs global integrative efforts, such as the United Nations-endorsed Sustainable Development \nGoals. It could host reading groups and provide special courses that are not offered by the departments \non innovative methodologies in sustainability sciences and scholarship.  \nSuch an institute could also offer focused faculty and graduate student workshops and hold an annual \nconference on research and teaching in sustainability, potentially in collaboration with the Association \nfor the Advancement of Sustainability in Higher Education and other institutions with successful \nacademic sustainability initiatives. It could host a sustainability leadership summit for faculty and \nresearch associates, building off the Student Sustainability Summit (hosted each year by Sustain SU \nand the Office of Sustainability), as well as the Alberta Student Leadership Summit (hosted by the \nStudent Group Services, the University of Alberta, and the Students‚Äô Union). At these three events, \nA Plan for Deepening Sustainability Education and Scholarship   /  Page 13 of 34 \nprofessors could learn how to incorporate more of the sustainability learning opportunities being offered \nby the Office of Sustainability and the Global Education Program5 into their course syllabi.  \nGraduate students in particular suggested an institute that could act as a ‚Äúsustainability hub‚Äù, a space \nfor graduate students to meet and work together on sustainability initiatives. The institute could be a \nclearinghouse of information for professors and graduate students about interdisciplinary journal \npublishing opportunities and networking possibilities across campus and across Canada on prescient \nsustainability research topics (e.g. integrated watershed management). \nProfessors frequently held that their research could have more impact if there was greater interaction \nbetween researchers and the media and government. The University could better facilitate this \ninteraction by providing training in knowledge translation. The Faculty of Extension is offering a new \n‚ÄúStrategic Reframing Course‚Äù that focuses on communication methods to create change in common \nunderstanding, tools to help build general understanding of complex issues, and approaches to \ntransform views on cultural and societal issues. This course would be a strong benefit to many \nuniversity faculty members to increase the impact of their research. Of particular interest are the \nprocesses around how university expertise can be more effectively applied to government decision-\nmaking and planning. Such training might be offered through the Centre for Teaching and Learning, the \nFaculty of Graduate and Research Studies, or the Research Services Office. \nd. Strategy: Promote opportunities for students and faculty to participate in sustainability \ninitiatives.  \nA centralized online information and networking system, in particular, was commonly suggested in our \nconsultations as a way to promote opportunities for students and faculty to participate in sustainability \ninitiatives. A centralized online system would help researchers with common interests connect with one \nother. Many faculty and graduate students spoke of the need for an easier, faster way to find others \nacross campus and across disciplines who are studying similar topics (e.g. water scarcity or disaster \npreparedness). The University should continue to support  the Undergraduate Research Initiative, \nwhich has a portal system that effectively advertises research opportunities for undergraduates, and \nmore recently offers research internships that focus on sustainability (funded by the Office of \nSustainability). \nAn online system containing up-to-date information on sustainability-focused and -related courses \nwould also help faculty and academic advisors suggest options to students for electives, especially \n‚Äúfree electives,‚Äù that complement the student‚Äôs general interest in sustainability. The online system \n5 For the Office of Sustainability, these learning opportunities are led by the Campus Sustainability Initiative which \nprovides institutional leadership and campus-wide communications and programs to integrate sustainability values \ninto all aspects of the University of Alberta. The Office of Sustainability engages and encourages students, staff and \nfaculty to engage in sustainability practices. A number of speakers, workshops, grants and volunteer opportunities \nexist for students to learn more about sustainability and lead sustainability efforts.  \nThe Global Education program inspires and cultivates students as the next generation of leaders prepared to tackle \ncritical issues facing the globe. Their signature event, International Week, is the University‚Äôs largest annual extra-\ncurricular educational event and is the most extensive event of its kind on a Canadian campus, and offers workshops, \nexhibits and cultural performances. Other learning opportunities are fostered by International House, grants for \ninternational education, and themed programs that bridge students with internal and external partners. \nhttp://www.globaled.ualberta.ca/en/InternationalWeek.aspx\nA Plan for Deepening Sustainability Education and Scholarship   /  Page 14 of 34 \nwould help instructors articulate and advertise what students can learn from sustainability courses that \nthey do not tend to learn from other courses. The University of Alberta‚Äôs standard online course catalog \ncould also provide an indicator for courses that are sustainability focused.  \ne. Strategy: Encourage departments and faculties to develop long-range sustainability plans \nencompassing operational practices, teaching, research, and degree programs.  \nFaculties and departments are encouraged, through an inclusive process, to identify programs they \nwish to add, enrich or discontinue, as part of their own long-range relevance to society. Part of this \nwould be to conduct long-range planning on new hires in emerging sustainability areas or in areas for \nwhich the University of Alberta lacks expertise. A delegated faculty leader, or sustainability committee, \ncould be assigned responsibility to inform the process; by summarizing what has been done elsewhere \nand suggesting updates to programs and curriculum in regards to sustainability. This faculty leader or \ncommittee could report on the department‚Äôs or unit‚Äôs progress, such as facilitating the opportunity for \nstudents to take sustainability courses outside their faculties, fostering cooperation for co-teaching or \ncourse cross-listing, using the University for place-based learning, and facilitating collaborative program \ndevelopment with other faculties. The faculty leader or committee could also assist in finding instructors \nand resources to offer new courses that are currently needed but not yet offered. \nFor example, the Faculty of Agricultural, Life and Environmental Sciences expressed interest in \ndeveloping a new interdisciplinary degree in sustainable systems. Building programs such as this \nrequires cross-departmental conceptualization of the program, its purpose, its learning outcomes, and \nits capacity to provide excellent sustainability education across multiple disciplines, all of which require \nleadership and a plan. Faculty of Arts representatives held that such long-range plans would help \nprompt the review and reinvigoration of programs such as the Bachelor of Arts in Environmental \nStudies, which is offered by the Faculty of Arts and the Faculty of Agricultural, Life and Environmental \nSciences. \nThe long-range plans could also prompt departments and program leaders to evaluate existing \nprograms and courses to identify gaps in sustainability content, remove outdated material, avoid \nunnecessary repetition, and share learning materials (such as curricular repositories). Faculty often \nrecommended the need to find easier ways to develop courses in specific areas, such as sustainable \nfood systems, climate change mitigation and adaption, cultural sustainability and so on. A repository for \nexisting syllabi in emerging areas of interest would therefore be useful. Faculty members also \ndiscussed the rigidity of too many programs that require most or even all of students‚Äô courses to be \ntaken in the same faculty. This directly discourages interdisciplinary learning. Program reform could \nallow and encourage more electives in sustainability courses and cross-listed courses between \nfaculties. The long-range plans could routinize succession planning for hiring and retention. Professors \nand senior leaders we consulted called for a democratic process that fosters prioritization, smooth \nteaching transitions, and long-term investment in senior academic leaders and academic staff, \ninstructors and contract employees. \nOne key element of such long-range plans would be for departments to define the topics and \ninterventions in their scholarship that relate to and promote sustainability. Some faculties, such as the \nFaculty of Rehabilitative Medicine, did not recognize their role in sustainability until a directed \ndiscussion on sustainability and their programs highlighted linkages between health and wellness, \nhealth care resources, disability studies, and social justice in the broader meaning of sustainability. It \nA Plan for Deepening Sustainability Education and Scholarship   /  Page 15 of 34 \nwas advised that professors and program leaders set aside time to explore what sustainability means \nfor them and their programs. An inclusive, engaging planning process would foster greater long-term \ninvestments in program improvements.  \nSome particular suggestions came from Native Studies faculty, who identified the need for better \ninterdisciplinary course offerings on indigenous orientations to environmental protection and business, \nsuch as co-taught courses on cooperative approaches to resource development and Aboriginal \nbusiness development. Native Studies faculty identified gaps in the curriculum for Environmental \nConservation Science and Native Studies students. There is no course offering in these programs on \nthe philosophy and epistemology of science. This further reproduces students‚Äô lack of awareness about \nhow traditional knowledge and science can be used together to address sustainability challenges (e.g. \nhabitat protection or water sanitation) in indigenous communities and in other non-Western cultures.  \nMany people in our consultation process encouraged stronger priority given to sustainability through its \nrecognition by faculty evaluation committees. For example, annual reports for faculties could ask \nprofessors and faculty service officers (FSOs) to indicate which of their research projects and papers \naddress sustainability on or off campus and indicate which are interdisciplinary. This would have \nseveral benefits. First, it would signal to faculty and FSOs that this kind of research is encouraged and \nrecognized as important. Second, it would allow the University of Alberta to encourage using our \ncampus as a ‚Äúsmall city‚Äù for sustainability learning and to report on this kind of research more readily in \nthe Sustainability Tracking, Assessment & Rating System‚Ñ¢ (STARS). STARS is the tool used by the \nUniversity of Alberta to benchmark our institution‚Äôs sustainability performance. \nMany faculty members who were consulted saw FEC evaluation processes as disincentives to \ncommunity-engaged sustainability research and faculty communities of practice in sustainability \nteaching and research. Community-based research requires time to develop mutual understanding and \ntrusting partnerships both within and outside the university. Therefore, FECs could more fully recognize \nthe value of building partnerships within and outside the university, as well as the time investments \nrequired for faculty to do this well. \nAssistant professors could be encouraged to engage in sustainability teaching and research, and they \ncould be rewarded by FECs when they do so. In some faculties, professors reported undue pressure to \nobtain grants that fund narrow questions, at the expense of pursuing partnerships and funding to \naddress sustainability issues that are inherently interdisciplinary or transdisciplinary.  \nMany faculty also recommended that FECs show greater recognition and value of ‚Äúslow scholarship‚Äù or \nthe provision of sufficient time for higher order thinking and writing that is important to address wicked \nproblems, often resulting in books that take one to three years to write. Additionally, giving equal credit \nfor publishing in interdisciplinary journals as in disciplinary journals would signal to professors that there \nis support for sustainability scholarship. Professors who co-write sustainability articles in collaboration \nwith staff in professional journals could also be rewarded for making important contributions to \nsustainability scholarship and practice.  \nGraduate students and the Kule Institute of Advanced Studies recommended the development of \nguidelines for ‚Äúsustainable research‚Äù, which would address practical and ideal guidelines to spur \npositive change for people and the planet. To promote sustainable research, researchers could share \nand conserve research materials and equipment, share research funding with other university partners \nand community partners (currently deemed to be very bureaucratically onerous or impossible), reduce \nA Plan for Deepening Sustainability Education and Scholarship   /  Page 16 of 34 \ncarbon footprints due to travel, and assure consistent three- to four-year funding of research assistants \nwho have developed knowledge and skills in a particular area. Professors could be rewarded for \naddressing policy, practice and public knowledge sustainability challenges, as this strengthens the \nuniversity‚Äôs long-term relationships with local people and places. There are also enormous needs to \npreserve and maintain access to data, which some respondents referred to as ‚Äúdata sustainability.‚Äù \nGoal 2.3 Support faculty members to integrate sustainability into their teaching. \na. Strategy: Develop initiatives to integrate sustainability into curriculum and academic \nprogramming.  \nA common suggestion was to prepare faculty to integrate sustainability into their teaching via faculty \ndevelopment workshops, new faculty orientation and by developing a community of practice. Faculty \nexpressed the desire for more opportunities to interact with each other on the topic of teaching. By \ndiscussing course content among themselves, faculty can learn from each other about how to foster \ngreater critical thinking about sustainability within their degree programs, as well as how to use \nemerging language (e.g. resilience, anthropocene, transitions and life-cycle analysis) that allows \ngreater common understanding of sustainability subjects. Nursing and Science faculty in particular \nemphasize the role of critical thinking as part of teaching sustainability. Nursing faculty also emphasize \nleadership training, which they assert could be oriented more directly to sustainability issues. \nNew faculty are in a good position to invest in their teaching, which can yield long-term benefits for \nthemselves, their students, and the University‚Äôs ability to offer up-to-date academic programs and \ncourses. Efforts to engage new professors in sustainability-related workshops and other sharing and \ntraining opportunities could be expanded. \nMany of our contacts for this report held that interdisciplinary teaching is a challenge, because most \nprofessors were trained within a specific discipline and their programs are built on past disciplinary \nfundamental content. Greater opportunity for faculty members to co-teach on a sustainability topic can \nenhance their knowledge and interdisciplinary offerings. Interdisciplinary teaching, and moreover \nprogram development, take vision and time to develop, so creating space for faculty to do so through \nspecial assignments, teaching relief or other incentives may better facilitate these developments. Many \nfaculty members held that departments and faculties can be too inward looking and territorial, which \ninhibits interdisciplinary teaching and scholarship.  \nFurther, many faculty members would also like to see a reduction in administrative tasks, especially \nwhere the delegation of these tasks could be more appropriately assigned. This would provide more \ntime for thoughtful and creative teaching and research and to develop new sustainability initiatives. \nGreater exchange between Augustana Campus, Campus Saint-Jean, and the University of Alberta \nnorth campus for sustainability speakers, workshops, Sustainability Awareness Week events, and so \non, could foster greater interdisciplinary faculty and student exchange. \nThe Faculty of Business participants called for more faculty members to teach students about a \ngrowing business emphasis on sustainability. The Alberta School of Business has a suite of courses on \ncorporate sustainability, social responsibility, and communications. It also has the Canadian Centre for \nCorporate Social Responsibility, which supports creativity and innovation in business practices that \nsupport the quality of life experienced by the communities in which they operate.  \nA Plan for Deepening Sustainability Education and Scholarship   /  Page 17 of 34 \nAnother example of an initiative that integrates sustainability into research is the ‚ÄúAfter Oil‚Äù project, \nwhich is a large, international academic and public research project based at the University of Alberta \nthat operates under the rubric of the Petrocultures Research Group (PRG). More recently, the Parkland \nInstitute at the University of Alberta was awarded a large Social Science and Humanities Research \nCouncil grant that partners with other organizations across three provinces on ‚ÄúMapping the Power of \nthe Carbon-Extractive Corporate Resource Sector.‚Äù  \nOther initiatives could provide greater support at the University of Alberta in regards to providing start-\nup funds or small grants for larger grant applications from the Research Services Office, the Faculty of \nGraduate Studies and Research, and the Faculties would be useful. Given that more sustainability \nresearch is in the ‚Äúimpact sciences‚Äù (which address the social, economic and ecological consequences \nof human activities) than the ‚Äúproduction sciences‚Äù (which address the ways to create and expand the \nuse of natural resources, efficient processes for making things, and useful consumer products), \nobtaining research funding for sustainability projects is more challenging. Thus, in-house funding to \nbuild up sustainability research capacity would be particularly useful. The application requirements for \nsmall amounts of money should not be so onerous that they discourage participation. \nAt a sustainability workshop for the social sciences and humanities in October 2014, professors \nidentified numerous sources of potential funding6 for sustainability-related research. Many of these \nrequire matching funding that could be provided by the University of Alberta. The Office of \nAdvancement at the University of Alberta could target donors, especially in the resource sector, to \ndonate to an ‚Äúendorsement fund‚Äù that would provide start-up funds for sustainability research related to \nthat sector.  \nThe Kule Institute of Advanced Studies at the University of Alberta funds transformational \ninterdisciplinary and comparative research at the highest standards nationally and internationally, and \nhas recently funded a number of sustainability focused and related grant proposals. \nThe University of Alberta and City of Edmonton Sustainability Scholars program offers applied research \nand professional development experience to graduate students through an innovative summer \ninternship program that sponsors graduate students to work on sustainability-related applied research \nprojects. This program, which partners the Office of the Provost, Office of Sustainability, Faculty of \nGraduate Studies and Research, and City of Edmonton, has expanded from six to 18 scholarship \npositions. This expansion also serves UAlberta‚Äôs goals to expand opportunities for graduate students in \nsustainability-applied research and in professional development training. \nb. Strategy: Build on existing community-based teaching and research partnerships and \ninternships.  \n6 Current on-campus funding opportunities exist through the Sustainability Enhancement Fund and Green Grants out of the \nOffice of Sustainability, the Undergraduate Research Initiative, the Teaching and Learning Enhancement Fund, and the Kule \nInstitute of Advanced Studies. Examples of industry funding could include Mountain Equipment Cooperative, Suncor, \nSyncrude, Save-On Foods, Ag-Funding Consortium, and the Northlands Park Edmonton. Examples of government funding \ncould include the City of Edmonton, Tri-Council federal funding, Networks for Centres of Excellence, the Campus Alberta \nInnovation Chairs (CAIP). Foundation examples include the Real Estate Fund of Alberta, the Gates Foundation, and the \nCatherine Donnelly Foundation. \nA Plan for Deepening Sustainability Education and Scholarship   /  Page 18 of 34 \nThe Director of Sustainability Scholarship and Education, out of the Office of the Provost, could work \nclosely with the University of Alberta‚Äôs Centre for Teaching and Learning (CTL) to develop a suite of \ncross-disciplinary case studies/examples that demonstrate how partnered groups (among community \nmembers, university staff, faculty and students, non-governmental and civic organizations) have \nfurthered sustainability. \nThe Community Service-Learning (CSL) office at the University of Alberta offers important opportunities \nfor students to work with community partners on sustainability-related challenges (e.g. watershed \nmanagement or poverty reduction). CSL also offers interdisciplinary spring courses that engage \nstudents with on-the-ground sustainability challenges. For example, a series has been offered on oil \ndevelopment and social and health issues. More CSL courses that explore what sustainability means to \ndifferent organizations could deepen sustainability education. Graduate students in particular requested \nmore graduate-level interdisciplinary CSL courses on sustainability-related topics.  \nThe Undergraduate Research Initiative (URI), in partnership with the Office of Sustainability and \nFacilities & Operations, also offers dedicated sustainability research internships on topics of \nsustainability and all of the URI research internships support interdisciplinary research undergraduate \ntraining.  \nGraduate students have requested more professional development courses related to sustainability. \nThe Faculty of Extension, in particular, is well poised to readily offer specific courses that address \nsustainability practice and that target continuing professionals. For example, they offer a course for \nprofessionals called ‚ÄúUnderstanding LEED [Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design] for \nBuilding Works‚Äù. Greater communication and collaboration between the Faculty of Extension and other \nfaculties could expand relevant and timely non-credit course offerings in the Faculty of Extension that \ncould be turned into credit-based undergraduate and graduate courses.  \nThe Office of Sustainability offers several student intern positions each year. Members of the Students‚Äô \nUnion requested more undergraduate internship opportunities in sustainability, similar to the \nSustainability Scholars program offered at the graduate level.  \nc. Strategy: Explore opportunities to regularly assess and report on sustainability literacy.  \nOne way to know if our students‚Äô knowledge, attitudes and interests around sustainability is shifting is to \ncreate a longitudinal data base on sustainability literacy. Ideally, it would be a very short survey that is \ncomparable to other universities and deemed legitimate and relevant to the University of Alberta. It \ncould be administered annually to a representative sample of University of Alberta students. Survey \nresults may reveal areas where students have greater or less knowledge, which could help inform \nacademic programs and the Office of Sustainability‚Äôs engagement programs. \nNext Steps \nThe Office of Sustainability is building an implementation plan for the overall University of Alberta \nSustainability Plan (2016-2020). Academic initiatives will be added to this plan as they emerge in the \ncoming months and years, and the appointed leaders of academic initiatives for sustainability, out of the \nOffice of the Provost, will develop avenues for faculty and students to be engaged in initiatives that \nemerge and grow from ‚ÄúA Plan for Deepening Sustainability Education and Scholarship at the \nUniversity of Alberta 2016-2020‚Äù. \nA Plan for Deepening Sustainability Education and Scholarship   /  Page 19 of 34 \nFinal Note \nThe University of Alberta can become a stronger leader in sustainability, regionally, nationally and \ninternationally, by fostering greater cross-fertilization across the disciplines, connecting to on- and off- \ncampus sustainability professionals, supporting start-up research in emerging areas of importance and \nareas of strength, and facilitating partnerships for sustainability tests and interventions. Greater \nUniversity dialogue and consequent common understanding around the complementarity of social \ngoals, such as greater health and wellness, equity, fairness and justice, with inclusive economies and \nrobust and resilient environments can ‚Äúraise the bar‚Äù in the University‚Äôs collective ability to convey the \nimportance of sustainability scholarship and education.  \nThis requires assessing our sustainability content and delivery strengths and deciding where we want \nto build our strengths and impact. It is a challenge to plan across 400 academic programs ‚Äì this will \nrequire more knowledge brokers and bridge builders in the future. A great deal of progress can be \nmade if departments and program leaders evaluate existing programs and courses to identify gaps in \nsustainability content, remove outdated material, avoid unnecessary repetition, share learning materials \n(such as curricular repositories), and co-teach across faculties and departments. This plan offers a \nsuite of suggestions and ideas for academic sustainability initiatives, and a roadmap to better planning \nfor the future for the University of Alberta to have a more positive impact on the world.  \nA Plan for Deepening Sustainability Education and Scholarship   /  Page 20 of 34 \nAppendix A: Summary of Workshops and Consultations \nA total of 78 individuals, representing 17 Faculties and 24 Departments were engaged in range of \nconversations and dialogues. Details about these activities are outlined below. \n1. October 2014 Vision Workshop \n22 Social Sciences, Arts and Humanities professors gathered at Campus Saint-Jean on October 17, \n2014 for a workshop on ‚ÄúSustainability, Environment and Social Justice in the Social Sciences and \nHumanities at the University of Alberta‚Äù. The workshop was organized by Naomi Krogman, Director of \nSustainability Scholarship and Education, Office of the Provost and Professor in the Department of \nResource Economics and Environmental Sociology. Workshop assistants were Monica Gruezmacher, \nAdjunct Faculty in the Faculty of Extension, and Apryl Bergstrom, Research Assistant, Office of the \nProvost. \nWorkshop goals: \n‚Ä¢ Identify strengths and gaps in our theme areas; sustainability, environment and social justice \n‚Ä¢ Discuss university and faculty-led support that contributes to effective collaboration between \nSocial Sciences, Humanities, and Arts professors in regards to academic programming, course \ndevelopment, supporting a community of practice and identifying funds available for \ninterdisciplinary research. \n‚Ä¢ Inform the academic portion of the Sustainability Plan for University of Alberta that is to start in \n2017 (the current plan is in effect through 2016). \n‚Ä¢ Encourage the submission of a Cluster Grant letter of intent to the Kule Institute of Advanced \nStudies. \nWorkshop Organization \nThe workshop consisted of three work sessions: 1) Sustainability research, teaching and practice; 2) \nthe University of Alberta‚Äôs future in sustainability and interdisciplinary scholarship; and 3) Goals and \nStrategies for curriculum and research components in the University of Alberta‚Äôs Sustainability Plan. \nThe topics and questions discussed during these sessions are outlined in more detail below: \nTopics in work session 1: Sustainability research, teaching and practice \n‚Ä¢ Funding opportunities and challenges \n‚Ä¢ Content and development of academic programs and courses \n‚Ä¢ Challenges in creating a community of practice \n‚Ä¢ Challenges of interdisciplinary research \nInterview questions in work session 2: UAlberta‚Äôs future in sustainability and interdisciplinary \nscholarship \nA Plan for Deepening Sustainability Education and Scholarship   /  Page 21 of 34 \n‚Ä¢ What are sustainability related themes that the U of A should have given the size, rank and \nsister campuses of our institution? \n‚Ä¢ What are the strengths in sustainability scholarship for the faculties of Social Sciences, Arts and \nHumanities? Other faculties? \n‚Ä¢ What are the gaps in sustainability scholarship for the faculties of Social Sciences, Arts and \nHumanities?

Sustainability Plan Workshops \nSustainability Plan workshops from January to April 2015 with two groups:  \n1. The Office of Sustainability Academic Advisory Committee (OSAAC)7  \n2. A group composed of undergraduate and graduate students, non-academic staff, faculty, \nprofessional staff, alumni and community members. Participants were recruited through \npromotions by the Office of Sustainability. They signed up through an online survey. Additional \npeople were identified as responsible parties in education and research, and they were also \ninvited to attend the workshops. \nEach group attended two workshops between January and April 2015. First, a Vision workshop was \nheld to try to come up with a shared vision for sustainability in 2020 at the University of Alberta, with \nrespect to education and research. This was later followed by an Obstacles and Strategies workshop, \nwhere participants suggested ways of overcoming obstacles and developing strategies to help realize \nour shared vision about sustainability in education and research within the next five years. \n3. Individual Consultations \nConsultations with Deans, Associate Deans \nThe Dean, Associate Dean, Research and Associate Dean, Academic (or their equivalents) were sent \nthe questions below. They were invited to meet with Naomi Krogman to discuss what they would like to \nsee in education and research when it comes to sustainability, both within their faculties and throughout \n7 In spring 2015, the Office of Sustainability Academic Advisory Committee (OSAAC) was renamed the Provost's \nAcademic Advisory Council on Sustainability (PAACS). \nA Plan for Deepening Sustainability Education and Scholarship   /  Page 22 of 34 \nthe university. Detailed notes were taken at each of the consultations and sent back to the Deans and \nAssociate Deans for review. Those who were interested in sharing their ideas but were unable to meet \nwere invited to submit written answers instead. \nQuestions sent to Deans and Associate Deans: \n1) What academic areas would you like to enhance in your faculty that relate to sustainability?  \n2) What sustainability area(s), if any, do you wish to build up in your faculty, in terms of curriculum \nor strengthened programming, in your faculty? Are there specific program names or course titles \nyou can suggest? \n3) What are the key threats, if any, to the current sustainability-related courses and academic \nprograms you have in your faculty? \n4) What are key opportunities and barriers for faculty interested in sustainability-related research? \n5) When it comes to sustainability at the University of Alberta, what do you want to see in \ncurriculum or research in five years?  \na. What obstacles might stand in the way of achieving this vision? \nb. What strategies can be used to address these obstacles and achieve our goals? \nc. What resources or support might be needed to achieve our goals? \n6) How could we expand opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students to research and \nlearn about sustainability initiatives on campus, as a living lab? To learn about sustainability \nmore broadly? \n7) What are some of the core issues in sustainability in which you would like to see more \npartnership with other faculties (if any)?

Not so long ago, we had \nno idea how big a shift it would take. In the future, people will wonder how \nwe swiveled so quickly to meet the challenge. But this report shows just how \nquickly it can be done. It is more than possible, it‚Äôs already happening.\nThe fi rst Sustainability Plan was formulated in 2011. It builds on our strong \nfoundation in energy management, recycling and community-building to help \nus reach further. It articulated a vision and focused our actions on new goals. \nWith a plan in place, progress has accelerated and together we have \naccomplished so much more than we set out to.

The Certifi cate in Sustainability means students in nine faculties can gain \npractical knowledge and professional development in sustainability, regardless of their major. \nSustainability Scholars provides funding and mentorship to motivated graduate students who \nwant to take their research into the city to see real change.

Since 1975, the university has had a successful energy management program \nthat has saved $320 million and avoided 2.3 million tonnes of greenhouse gas emissions. In \nrecent years, the plan has implemented intelligent monitoring systems and new technologies \nto accelerate savings even further.\nUAlberta is also home to one of North America‚Äôs largest campus-based district energy systems. \nWith natural gas power and mass distribution, the DES provides effi  cient heating, cooling and \nelectricity to over 2 million square meters of university and hospital space. Installing high \neffi  ciency turbine generators and co-generation is driving greater savings.\nAll of this provided the strong foundation the university needs to meet the challenge of climate \nchange head on by moving boldly into renewable energy.

Attachment 1- GFC ad hoc Committee on Academic Governance including Delegation ‚Äì Guiding \nPrinciples (2 pages) \nPrepared by: Meg Brolley, General Faculties Council (GFC) Secretary, meg.brolley@ualberta.ca   \nmailto:meg.brolley@ualberta.ca\n1 \nGFC AD HOC COMMITTEE ON ACADEMIC GOVERNANCE \nINCLUDING DELEGATED AUTHORITY \nAd hoc Committee on Academic Governance including Delegated Authority \nGuiding Principles \nIntroduction \nCharged, as it is, with making recommendations with regard to academic governance, the ad hoc \ncommittee began its work by identifying some of the core ‚Äòguiding principles‚Äô that should inform its \ndeliberations. \nWe understand ‚Äògovernance‚Äô as the processes through which an organization defines and achieves its \nmandate. This includes making decisions with regard to the structures, policies, and practices of decision-\nmaking, the exercise of authority, and the mechanisms of accountability.   \nUniversity governance is multi-level and bicameral. Provincial legislation ‚Äì the Post-Secondary Learning \nAct (PSLA) ‚Äì sets the framework for university governance. At the institutional level, the PSLA prescribes \nthat UAlberta will have bicameral institutions of governance ‚Äì that is, there are two governing bodies. The \nBoard of Governors (the Board) oversees the business affairs of the institution ‚Äì from appointing the \nPresident, through to approving budgets, investment strategies, collective agreements, and long-range \nstrategic planning. The General Faculties Council (GFC) oversees ‚Äòacademic affairs‚Äô. \nTo understand the operations of the university, it is important to note the distinction between ‚Äògovernance‚Äô \nand ‚Äòadministration‚Äô. While the Board and GFC set policies and establish broad directions for the institution, \nthe university‚Äôs senior executive team is responsible for administrative operations, including operational \npolicies and decisions. And this is replicated at the Faculty and Departmental levels across the university.  \nGood governance requires collegial practice at all levels including the Board, the executive and all \nmembers of the institution.  \nThis ad hoc committee‚Äôs mandate pertains to reviewing academic governance at the institutional level. \nThus, we are to remain focused on the operations of GFC and its standing committees (including the \ndelegation of authority from GFC, the mandate and structure of committees, and related matters). \nBut, as a matter of principle, we embrace a reasonably expansive understanding of ‚Äòacademic affairs‚Äô and, \nthus, GFC‚Äôs mandate. We support the notion that GFC must have the capacity to defend its legitimate role \nwith regard to issues that exist at the boundary between governance and administration, as well as \nbetween Board and GFC responsibilities. We also support the notion that GFC should have early \nopportunities to influence strategic decisions and directions that are set by the Board or administration, but \nimpinge on academic affairs. \nGuiding Principles \nAs a committee, we are committed to the principles of ‚Äòcollegial academic governance‚Äô. These principles \ninclude: \n‚Ä¢ A desire to build mutual understanding of common goals and shared purpose ‚Äì operationalized in \nnumerous ways, including the adoption of an institutional strategic plan. \n‚Ä¢ A commitment to inclusive and participatory governance decision-making.  \n‚Ä¢ A desire to facilitate meaningful individual-level engagement in governance processes. \n‚Ä¢ A commitment to openness, transparency, and respectful communication.  \n‚Ä¢ A commitment to responsiveness, respect, and reciprocity between governing bodies and between \ngoverning bodies and university administration.  \nAd Hoc Committee on Academic Governance including Delegated Authority \nGuiding Principles \n2 \nFurther Guiding Elements \nGuided by these principles, we begin our deliberations in agreement on the following: \n‚Ä¢ GFC must take seriously its responsibility for academic affairs, and commit to showing leadership \non emerging issues and serving as a forum for discussing and taking decisions in the interest of \nacademic freedom, and excellence in research, creativity, and teaching and learning. \n‚Ä¢ While the standing Committees of GFC should have real power to make (or initiate) substantive \ndecisions, a commitment to regular and reciprocal communication should position GFC to ensure \nthat its members retain the capacity to bring significant issues to the floor of GFC for debate and \ndecision. Standing Committee chairs have a responsibility to identify issues that Standing \nCommittee members feel are deserving of discussion by full GFC. \n‚Ä¢ The composition of GFC Standing Committees should reflect the principle of meaningful \nrepresentation of elected, appointed, and ex officio, and student, staff, and faculty membership. \n‚Ä¢ While ensuring appropriate checks and balances are in place, appropriate consultations occur, and \ncompeting interests are always considered, GFC‚Äôs committee structure and decision making \nprocesses should be designed to ensure streamlined pathways for the consideration and, when \ndesired, approval of proposals flowing from Faculties and other units within the University. \n‚Ä¢ Meetings of GFC must be conducted in a manner that encourages participation and engagement.  \n‚Ä¢ Members of GFC, whether they are elected, appointed, or ex officio, student, staff, or faculty, \nshould be encouraged to represent the interests of any ‚Äòconstituency‚Äô with which they are affiliated, \nwhile also considering competing interests and striving to consider (and define) the broader \ninstitutional interest. \nThis overview of the ad hoc committee‚Äôs guiding principles is, in many ways, incomplete, but it reflects our \nstarting point for considering the many issues before us. \nItem No. 10 \nGENERAL FACULTIES COUNCIL \nFor the Meeting of November 21, 2016 \nOUTLINE OF ISSUE \nAction Item \nAgenda Title: Proposed Changes to the Statement on Equity in Student Affairs \nMotion:  THAT General Faculties Council, as recommended by the GFC Academic Planning Committee, \napprove the proposed changes to the Statement on Equity in Student Affairs found in the section University \nRegulations and Information for Students/General University Policies/Statement on Equity in Student Affairs \nof the University Calendar as submitted by the Office of the Registrar and as set forth in Attachment 1, to \ntake effect upon final approval. \nItem   \nAction Requested Approval Recommendation   \nProposed by Provost and Vice-President (Academic), and Vice-Provost and University \nRegistrar \nPresenter Lisa Collins, Vice-Provost and University Registrar \nDetails \nResponsibility Provost and Vice-President (Academic) \nThe Purpose of the Proposal is \n(please be specific) \nTo revise the Student Statement on Equity to reflect changes to Alberta \nHuman Rights Legislation and changing norms in diversity and equity \nwithin the academy. \nThe Impact of the Proposal is The proposed changes align with the University Statement on Equity \nwhich is used on all academic and support staff job postings as outlined \nin the UAPPOL Procedures for Academic Staff Posting and Advertising \nand Support Staff Posting and Advertising.  \nReplaces/Revises (eg, policies, \nresolutions) \nRevises Statement on Equity in Student Affairs and the General \nAdmission Requirements of the University Calendar \nTimeline/Implementation Date 2017-2018 University Calendar \nEstimated Cost and funding \nsource \nN/A \nNext Steps (ie.: \nCommunications Plan, \nImplementation plans) \nThe revised Statement on Equity in Student Affairs would be included in \nthe 2017-18 University Calendar. \nSupplementary Notes and \ncontext \nEngagement and Routing (Include meeting dates) \nParticipation: \n(parties who have seen the \nproposal and in what capacity) \n<For further information see \nthe link posted on the \nGovernance Toolkit section \nStudent Participation Protocol> \nThose who have been informed: \n‚Ä¢ Jay Spark Vice-Provost & Associate VP (HR) and the Office of \nFaculty Relations -

In this manner the \nUniversity demonstrates its commitment to \nimproving the representativeness of its \ncommunities. \nThe Alberta Human Rights Act, sections \n3 and 11.1, requires that no individual be \ndiscriminated against on the basis of race, \nreligious beliefs, color, gender, physical \ndisability, mental disability, marital status, \nage, ancestry, or place of origin, family status, \nor source of income except where \nthe discrimination can be shown to be \nreasonable and justifiable. The University of \nAlberta recognizes and accepts its \nresponsibility to comply with the requirements \nof this Act in its consideration of students for \nadmission, promotion, and graduation. Of its \nown volition the University of Alberta does not \ndiscriminate on the basis of sexual orientation \nor political belief. \nSubject to the limits set out in the \nAlberta Human Rights Act, the University of \nAlberta affirms its right to determine the \ncriteria by which applicants are accepted into \nthe University community. Individuals seeking \nadmission to or continuance in academic \nprograms must meet the qualifications and \nperformance standards set out by the \nUniversity Equity Statement in Student \nAffairs \nThe University recognizes the diversity of the \nCanadian population and obligation to be \naccessible to all sectors of society. The \nUniversity therefore encourages diversity and \nwelcomes applications from all qualified \npersons including women, members of visible \nminorities, First Nations, M√©tis, and Inuit, \npersons with disabilities, and sexual and \ngender minorities. The University Calendar \nwill use gender inclusive language when \nreferring to members of the University \nCommunity. This demonstrates the \nUniversity‚Äôs commitment to accommodating \nand improving the representativeness of \nits diverse communities. \nThe Alberta Human Rights Act, prohibits \ndiscrimination against any person because \nof race, religious beliefs, colour, \ngender, gender identity, gender expression, \nphysical disability, mental disability, ancestry, \nplace of origin, marital status, source of \nincome, family status or sexual \norientation, except where the distinction can \nbe shown to be reasonable and justifiable in \nthe circumstances. The University of \nAlberta complies with the Act when it \nconsiders students for admission, promotion, \nand graduation. Of its own volition, the \nUniversity of Alberta does not discriminate on \nthe basis of political belief.  \nSubject to the limits set out in the Alberta \nHuman Rights Act, the University of Alberta \naffirms its right to determine the criteria by \nwhich applicants are accepted into the \nUniversity community.

The statement would reflect the language commonly used in \nemployment equity statements and includes the addition of gender \nexpression and gender identity which are now protected grounds in \nlegislation. References to designated groups identified in the \nEmployment Equity Act have been removed as the groups identified are \nnow broader and align with Alberta Human Rights legislation. The \nproposed changes align with the Statement on Equity in Student Affairs \nin the University Calendar. \nReplaces/Revises (eg, policies, \nresolutions) \nRevises the defined University Equity Statement to indicate the \nUniversity Employment Equity Statement in the UAPPOL Academic Staff \nPosting and Advertising and Support Staff Posting and Advertising.  \nTimeline/Implementation Date Upon approval \nEstimated Cost and funding \nsource \nN/A \nNext Steps (ie.: \nCommunications Plan, \nImplementation plans) \nThe University Employment Equity Statement and the University \nTerritorial Statement will be included on the Human Resource Services \nwebsite. \nSupplementary Notes and \ncontext \nProposed changes to the Statement on Equity in Student Affairs in the \nUniversity Calendar will go forward with this proposal to the GFC \nExecutive Committee and General Faculties Council.  \nIn 2011, the Board of Governors approved UAPPOL human resource \npolicies and procedures to take effect July 1, 2011.

This authority has not been reflected in the documents to date; \nat this time, the proposal seeks to have this confirmed. \nIn addition, the changes to the Equity Statement which align with current \nlegislative requirements, are also an important statement of the \nUniversity‚Äôs position and practice in this area.

I \nunderstand that APC approved the program in principle at its meeting on June 10, 2015. \nAs a faculty member, I was first notified of the details of the program at my Department Council \nmeeting on Tuesday, September 20th 2016, and heard that there is an expectation that \nsupervisors will serve as ‚Äúmentors‚Äù to their students in this matter, and will have the \nresponsibility of reviewing and confirming to the Department that the student has completed \ntheir Individual Development Plans. This is not a particularly onerous responsibility (and \nmentoring our students is our job anyway) but I am surprised that a new obligation has been \nplaced on faculty members without discussion and approval by GFC. I also note that the APC \nprocess does not appear to have included consultation with AASUA, which might have been \nappropriate since this program increases faculty workload. I would ask FGSR to provide full \ndetails of this program to GFC for approval. I would also like to know whether the \nresponsibilities in this program will be formalized in a UAPPOL policy. \nThank-you, \nJeremy Richards \nResponse 12.1R  from Vice-Provost and Dean, Faculty of Graduate Studies and Research \nThank you for the question concerning the new Professional Development requirement.  We \nwelcome this discussion at General Faculties Council since it is important for all students, \nsupervisors, deans, associate deans, graduate coordinators and graduate administrators to \nunderstand the requirement. There are several parts to your question, and we are pleased to \nprovide some background information for context. \nBackground \nAll graduate students who began their programs in September 2016 must satisfy a Professional \nDevelopment (PD) requirement. The PD requirement has two parts: first, students must \ncomplete eight hours of PD training during each degree; second, they must complete an \nIndependent Development Plan (IDP).  \nThis two-part requirement was proposed and approved by FGSR Council, the governing body \ncomposed of representatives from all 72 graduate-degree-offering departments.  \nFGSR staff have held information sessions and workshops on the new requirement, tailored \nwherever possible to individual departments. As of 1 Nov 2016, these face-to-face sessions \nGENERAL FACULTIES COUNCIL \nFor the Meeting of November 21, 2016 \nItem 12.1Q and 12.1R \n2 \nhave reached 1360 students and 139 faculty. (For reference, our total entering class for Fall \n2016 is 2400.) In addition to the IDP orientation, FGSR has posted FAQs on our website. \nStudents may meet the PD training requirement through discipline-specific training, internships \n(through the GSIP program or other), short courses, professional placements, online modules or \nany of the 650 PD sessions posted by FGSR, 131 of which are developed by the grad school. \nWe offer two workshops (beyond the orientation session) that specifically cover the IDP, and \nthese workshops may be counted toward the PD training requirement. Typically students will \ndraw from more than one source of professional development. \nThe IDP requires students to research various career paths, assess their own skillset and fill \nany gaps, and establish a plan for moving from graduate degree to career. The IDP is done \nunder the guidance of a mentor or (ideally) mentors who do not have to be the student‚Äôs \nsupervisor(s), though in many cases the supervisor does serve as a career mentor. It is \nimportant that the supervisor not be mandated as the sole PD mentor since many course-based \nMaster‚Äôs students do not have a supervisor. It is the responsibility of students to secure a \nmentor. \nThe PD requirement as a whole is signed off by a department‚Äôs graduate administrator. \nYou asked: \n‚Ä¢ Will the details of the actual program come before GFC for approval? \no The Academic Planning Committee has delegated authority to approve revisions \nto existing graduate programs. The Professional Development requirement was \ndiscussed and approved on 10 June 2015 by the Academic Planning committee, \nacting under that delegated authority from General Faculties Council. APC \napproved the motion on the recommendation of the Academic Standards \nCommittee.   \no Before reaching APC, the requirement was discussed and approved by FGSR \ncouncil, the policy-making body of FGSR that does have broad representation \nfrom across departments.    \n‚Ä¢ Did FGSR consult AASUA? \no Consultation across the academy was broad and comprehensive. Because \nmentors are not necessarily supervisors and because faculty members are not \nrequired to sign off on individual students‚Äô PD requirements, this initiative is not \nseen as a new obligation on faculty. Admittedly, many faculty members will play \na role in their students‚Äô professional development. We are happy to speak to the \nAASUA about how this requirement is being realized for graduate students and \ntheir supervisors.  \n‚Ä¢ Will the responsibilities in this program be formalized in a UAPPOL policy? \no The PD Requirement is at its base a program requirement for graduate students. \nThus it is formalized in the University Calendar and the Graduate Program \nManual.  \nGENERAL FACULTIES COUNCIL \nFor the Meeting of November 21, 2016 \nItem 12.2Q and 12.2R \nQuestion from GFC Member Jeremy Richards (submitted by email October 31, 2016) \nQuestion 12.2 Q \nAt a recent Faculty of Science pre-FEC meeting, we learned that the GFC policy on who gets to \nsee written comments on USRIs seems to have changed. My previous recollection was that \nonly the instructor and department chair (and administrative assistant) got to see the written \ncomments, and they were considered confidential. Now the GFC Policy Manual reads: \n¬ß111.3.H.i.  Access to USRI Data:  Parties having access to numerical summaries of the ten \nUniversal Student Ratings of Instruction questions and student comments will be the instructor \nthe Chair, Director or Dean of the unit offering the course; members of Tenure Committees; and \nmembers of Faculty Evaluation Committees, including the secretary to the FEC. (EXEC 07 NOV \n2011) (GFC 22 SEP 2014) \n(http://www.gfcpolicymanual.ualberta.ca/en/111TeachingandLearningandTeach.aspx)  \nI note that this change had already been enacted prior to the 22 September, 2014, GFC \nmeeting referred to above, where changes were only made to enable eUSRIs. \nMy questions are therefore: \n1. When and by whom were these changes made that allow access to USRI comments by \nChairs, Deans, members of Tenure Committees, and members of FECs? \n2. Was GFC apprised of these changes, and did it approve them? \nResponse 12.2 R from the Provost and Vice-President (Academic) \nOn June 9, 1995, General Faculties Council (GFC) approved a series of changes to Section \n111.3 of the GFC Policy Manual that clearly outlined who had access to USRI data. These \nchanges were approved on the recommendation of the Academic Development Committee.   \nOn March 17, 1999, GFC voted to include the specific reference to student comments in \n111.3.g. At that time the policy read \"Parties having access to numerical summaries of the ten \nUniversal Student Ratings of Instruction questions and student comments shall be the \ninstructor, the Chair, Director or Dean; members of Tenure Committees; and members of \nFaculty Evaluation Committees.\"  This addition was a part of a set of major revisions to the GFC \nPolicy Manual, stemming from two years of work by the Teaching and Learning Committee \n(TLC) Teaching Evaluation Subcommittee.  TLC recommended the changes to the GFC \nExecutive Committee, who recommended the changes to full GFC. \nhttp://www.gfcpolicymanual.ualberta.ca/en/111TeachingandLearningandTeach.aspx\nGENERAL FACULTIES COUNCIL \nFor the Meeting of November 21, 2016 \nItem 12.3Q and 12.3R \n1 \nQuestion from GFC Member Dilini Vethanayagam (submitted by email November 7, 2016) \nQuestion 12.3 Q \nI'm sending this as a question to bring up at the November GFC. It affects students I bring on for \nsmaller educational clinical / translational research projects. \nThe U of A RSO has recently informed me of changes in the financial management of individual \nfaculty members' General Research Accounts.  \nQuestion 1: Why were these decisions not brought before GFC for broader discussion? \nThis decision I do feel impacts the FOMD much moreso than other faculties where direct patient \ncontact does not occur as much.   \nResponse 12.3 R from the  Associate Director of Research Services Office \nWhen the Research Services Offices makes changes to policies and procedures, the nature \nand extent of consultations undertaken is dependent upon what is being amended and who is \nimpacted.  The revised \"Lab and General Research Services Project\" terms of reference is \nintended to reflect current UAPPOL policies and procedures including the \"Guide to Financial \nManagement\" and accordingly we must ensure the terms of reference are up to date.  \nConsultations undertaken for changes to UAPPOL policies and procedures are based upon the \nguidance provided in UAPPOL's Policy Development Toolkit.  When the \"Indirect Costs of \nResearch\" UAPPOL procedure was updated in 2013 to include a standard indirect costs rate of \n20% for research contracts, grants, technical services agreements, flow through contracts and \nclinical trials, consultations with the following groups were undertaken: \nURPC - 21 March and 31 May 2013 \nChairs' Council - 21 May 2013  \nDeans' Council - 15 May and 19 June 2013  \nPEC-S - 21 August 2013  \nPEC-S/Deans' Retreat - 22 August 2013  \nMemo from Acting Provost and VP (Academic), VP (Research) and VP (Finance & \nAdministration) sent to Deans on 30 August  2013 confirming that the new indirect costs of \nresearch revenue sharing agreement would take effect following governance approval  \nAASUA - 25 September 2013 \nBoard Finance and Property Committee - 26 November 2013  \nBoard of Governors - 13 December 2013 \neffective date of procedure was January 1, 2014 \nGENERAL FACULTIES COUNCIL \nFor the Meeting of November 21, 2016 \nItem 12.3Q and 12.3R \n2 \nWhen the Lab and General Research Services Project terms of reference were updated in 2016 \nto reflect this and other changes, consultations were undertaken to communicate the changes \nand obtain feedback.  We forwarded the draft Terms of Reference document to the members of \nthe Finance Management Committee on June 9, 2016 who undertook to consult with their \nrespective faculties.  Feedback was received from the Faculty of Medicine and Dentistry which \nresulted in changes to the draft document.  In addition, we were asked to meet with a number of \nrepresentatives of the Faculty of Science as a follow up on June 17, 2016.  In that meeting, a \nnumber of concerns were expressed which resulted in further changes being made to the Terms \nof Reference.   \nIf any questions or concerns remain with respect to the Terms of Reference for Lab and General \nServices Projects, Michael Walesiak, Associate Director, Finance and Information would be \navailable to discuss.   \n11/7/2016

FACULTIES COUNCIL \nFor the Meeting of November 21, 2016 \nItem 12.4Q \nQuestion from GFC Member Carolyn Sale (submitted by email November 14, 2016) \nQuestion 12.4 Q \nI bring this question forward on the part of a concerned member of the academic staff: \nIn early October, a large floor stand poster appeared in the walkway between HUB Mall and the \nTory atrium denouncing the former Soviet Union. It stayed up for several days leading up to the \nThanksgiving long weekend. It was a peculiar poster, for an anachronistic cause, with no \nidentifying information as to the sponsoring individual, organization, or program ‚Äî just a phone \nnumber for buildings and maintenance indicating that it would be up for several dates before \nand after the long weekend. \nUpon inquiry to the listed number, it emerged that the backer was ‚Äúan alum‚Äù but no further \ninformation could be provided. The faculty member was referred to University Relations. Several \nphone calls from the faculty member to University Relations went unanswered, but eventually \nprompted a letter of response from the Vice-President for Facilities and Operations, Andrew \nSharman, indicating that new procedures would be introduced going forward requiring all \npromotional posters, flyers, banners and the like to identify clearly the sponsoring \norganization(s) and/or individual(s). However, since the poster in question had been approved \nunder old procedures, no information as to its backer was furnished. \nMr. Sharman said his office had contacted the backer to ask permission to share his or her \nidentity, but that no response had yet been received and so no further information could be \nprovided. In the meantime, the poster in question disappeared and was not displayed on the \nsecond set of dates originally indicated. \nThat new procedures are going to be introduced that continue to make the university campus ‚Äì  \nas is perfectly appropriate ‚Äì host to a multitude of views, even controversial or peculiar ones ‚Äì is \nwelcome news. That there is an identifiable distinction between openness to and *endorsement \nof* views put forth in university space is important. The question: why the continuing secrecy \nabout the identity of the backer of the display that prompted this policy change? \n[Response from the Vice-President (Facilities and Operations) be forwarded to GFC when \nprovided and will appear as Item 12.4R] \nGENERAL FACULTIES COUNCIL \nFor the Meeting of November 21, 2016 \nItem 12.4Q and 12.4R \nQuestion from GFC Member Carolyn Sale (submitted by email November 14, 2016) \nQuestion 12.4 Q \nI bring this question forward on the part of a concerned member of the academic staff: \nIn early October, a large floor stand poster appeared in the walkway between HUB Mall and the \nTory atrium denouncing the former Soviet Union.

The question: why the continuing secrecy \nabout the identity of the backer of the display that prompted this policy change? \nResponse 12.4 R from the Vice-President (Facilities and Operations)  \nUnder the procedure in force at the time, individuals or groups who sought permission to post \non campus were not required to include contact information on their postings. As a result, the \nbanner at issue did not include any contact information about the individual or group who posted \nit.  \nWe have consulted with the University's Information and Privacy Office on this issue. The \nFreedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act (FOIP Act) states that personal \ninformation can only be disclosed or shared within the University in certain circumstances. For \nexample, it can be shared within the University for the purpose for which it was collected, with \nthe individual's consent, or if it is necessary for an employee to know the personal information in \norder to do the employee's job. As correctly noted in the question, after receiving inquiries, we \nreached out and requested permission to add the sponsor's contact information to the banner, \nbut they did not respond to the request. There does not appear to be authority within the FOIP \nGENERAL FACULTIES COUNCIL \nFor the Meeting of November 21, 2016 \nItem 12.4Q and 12.4R \nAct to make the individual's identity publicly available without consent. As a result, we are \npresently unable to disclose the identity of the individual or group responsible for this posting. \nAs noted in the question, going forward new procedures and practices are being implemented to \nrequire all such postings to include the identity and contact information of the sponsoring \nindividuals or groups. \nAttachment: October 14, 2016 letter from A. Sharman regarding banner in pedway between \nHUB Mall and Tory Building \n2-04 South Academic Building (SAB)\nEdmonton, Alberta, Canada  T6G 2G7\nTel: 780.492.9238\nFax: 780.492.1439\nwww.facilities.ualberta.ca\nOFFICE OF THE VICE-PRESIDENT\nFACILITIES AND OPERATIONS\nOctober 14, 2016 \nDr. Kathleen Lowrey \nAnthropology \n14-13 Tory Building, HM \nUniversity of Alberta \nEdmonton, AB T6G 2H4 \nDear Dr. Lowrey, \nI want to sincerely thank you for sharing your concerns about the banner displayed in the pedway between HUB \nMall and the Tory Building. Your concerns have highlighted gaps in the University of Alberta‚Äôs existing procedure \nrelated to postings on our campus, which we are now working to amend. I hope you will find this response helpful. \nThe university‚Äôs Posting Announcements, Notices and Banners Procedure governs who can post notices and \nbanners, where postings may be displayed and what postings are permissible, among other things. Under this \nprocedure, Facilities and Operations (F&O) reviews requests to display banners and posters and makes a \ndecision based on safety and environmental considerations. As part of an institution that supports academic \nfreedom, F&O does not approve or deny a poster or banner based on its content, provided that content is lawful \nand otherwise complies with university policies and procedures, including those related to human rights.    \nIn this case, the person who posted the banner followed this procedure and obtained permission to display it from \nOct. 3-7 and 10-14. Though we flagged the content of this poster as potentially controversial, we found nothing in \nthe procedure or associated policies that would support a decision not to post it.  \nHowever, the concerns you raised with respect to this banner helped us recognize a shortfall in our existing \nprocedure; namely, it is impossible to engage in a debate or discussion if you don‚Äôt know with whom to engage in \ndebate and discussion.   \nAgain, in this case, the banner at issue did not include any contact information about the individual or group who \nposted it. Having such information would enable such debate and discussion to occur. Presently, the identity of \nthe person or group responsible for this posting is not something that we can disclose without permission. We \nhave reached out and requested permission to add their contact information to the banner, but they have not yet \nresponded. \nAs a result, we are working with the appropriate offices to amend the procedure to a) require the posting person \nor group to identify themselves and their contact information on the materials they seek to post and b) clarify the \nprocess for review and approval of the material applicants seek to post. In the meantime, F&O, as part of our \napproval process, will require applicants to identify themselves and their contact information on any materials they \nwish to post on campus. \n2 \nI wish to thank you again for taking the time to share your concerns about this banner. We hope that having \ncontact information on all such postings will enable members of our community to engage with the sponsors of \nthose postings in a healthy discussion and debate of ideas.   \nSincerely, \nAndrew Sharman \nVice-President (Facilities and Operations) \nUniversity of Alberta \nItem No. 13 \nGENERAL FACULTIES COUNCIL \nFor the Meeting of November 21, 2016 \nGeneral Faculties Council Standing Committee Report \nExecutive Committee  \n1.

As in past years, we‚Äôve seen a continued acceptance of \nRestorative Justice as simply ‚Äúthe way we address conduct‚Äù as opposed to a unique and novel \nconcept that students struggle with. That being said, this past year highlighted the necessity of \ncontinued training on how to functionally use Restorative Justice in a residence community to \nensure consistent application of RJ principles across our residence halls, including to address \nbehavior previously thought to be the realm of the Residence Agreement.\nWhile in previous years we struggled to generate consistent data due to a changeover in our \nHousing Management system, this year‚Äôs data was captured with the same methodology as seen \nin the 2014/2015 Annual Report. Unfortunately, in July of 2016 our Housing Management \nSystem provider announced they would be discontinuing support for the Judicial management \nmodule in which we compile these statistics. While that does not impact this year‚Äôs data, it may \ncause challenges for future reports. However, we continue to work with our Housing \nManagement System provider to ensure our ability to report on our discipline statistics goes \nunchanged. \nAs with last year, we tracked our judicial statistics on two criteria: Violations, and Sanctions. \nThis allows us to more accurately reflect restorative principles in our judicial statistics. A key \nfactor of restorative justice is that it does not focus on a ‚Äòrule‚Äô that was broken; instead it focuses \non the harms that come from a person‚Äôs actions. Accordingly, violations are based on the \nbehaviour of the student that causes harm. \nSanctions are the results of those violations. In many cases, a single restorative sanction can \naddress the harms of several violations (for example, an apology to an entire community may be \nsufficient to address multiple harms caused).\nIn 2015/2016, we had 1,064 unique incidents. This represents a 25% increase over last year‚Äôs \nnumber (851 unique incidents); this increase is largely due to increased use of Restorative Justice \non East Campus to manage a wider range of cleanliness and operational issues. In the past, this \ntype of student behavior was almost exclusively handled through our Operations unit but in \nkeeping with our stated position that Restorative Justice is our preferred method of dealing with \nstudent conduct, training on Restorative Justice was extended to our Assignment Coordinators \nand Unit Coordinators. As such, a significant number of incidents were dealt with via Restorative \nJustice. Using restorative justice for cleanliness issues is a new practice for us and we expect \ncontinued growth in its utilization in the future. \nThese incidents resulted in 1210 violations. Those violations were resolved using 668 sanctions, \nof which 83% were Restorative solutions (Community Resolutions, Apology Letters, \nBehavioural Agreements, or Restorative Agreements). This is a slight reduction from last year‚Äôs \nfigure of 87%, but given the greater emphasis on Cleaning and Operations issues being dealt \nwith through Restorative Justice, this drop is quite minor.\nIn 2014/2015, Lister Centre accounted for the majority of our conduct with 66% of our total \nincidents originating in Kelsey, Mackenzie, Henday, or Sch√§ffer Hall. However, with the use of \nRestorative Justice for cleanliness issues in 2015/2016, the divide was right down the middle \nwith exactly 50% of our conduct cases in each portfolio. \nLast year‚Äôs report highlighted that we saw only 23% of total incidents directly related to alcohol, \nwhich was a 30% improvement over the year before. This year, that trend of improvement has \ncontinued with only 13% of total incidents directly related to alcohol. This trend of improvement \ncan likely be attributed to a change in the cultural of alcohol use in Lister center over the past \nseveral years, such as limited alcohol-related events and preventing consumption in public \nspaces.\nIn last year‚Äôs report we began collecting the frequency with which students of concern were \nmanaged by our staff, and discovered that from October (when we started tracking) through to \nMay of 2015, we had approximately 70 students at risk incidents (56 unique students). We \ntracked this figure again, and from May of 2015 to August of 2016 we found we had a marked \nincrease to 172 students of concern that came to our attention, with 126 unique cases.\nSanctions Issued:\nAlc\noh\nol \nPr\nob\nati\non\nAp\nolo\ngy\n Le\ntte\nr\nBe\nha\nvio\nral\n P\nrob\nati\non\nBe\nha\nvio\nura\nl A\ngre\nem\nen\nt\nCl\nea\nnin\ng C\nha\nrge\nCl\nea\nnin\ng R\nes\ntitu\ntio\nn\nCo\nmm\nun\nity\n R\nes\nolu\ntio\nn\nDa\nma\nge\n C\nha\nrge\nDa\nma\nge\ns R\nes\ntitu\ntio\nn\nEv\nict\nion\nNo\n S\nan\ncti\non\n - N\not \nRe\nsp\non\nsib\nle\nNo\nne\n S\npe\ncif\nied\nVis\nitin\ng R\nes\ntric\ntio\nn-50\n50\n150\n250\n350\n450\n550\n650\n3\n71 66\n104\n15 11\n366\n3 4 13\n116\n612\n12\nSanctions Issued May 2015 to August 2016\nNote: None Specified = No Responsible Student Identified; No Sanction ‚Äì Not Responsible = \nStudent Identified, but found Not Responsible. \nIncidents by Location:\n0 20 40 60 80 100 120 140 160 180\nTamarack\nSchaffer\nResidence Saint-Jean\nPinecrest\nNo Specific Location\nNewton\nMichener Park\nMain Lister \nMackenzie\nLinden\nKelsey\nI-House\nHUB\nHenday\nGrad Res\nECV\nAlder\n11\n161\n79\n39\n11\n104\n30\n58\n126\n2\n60\n39\n167\n125\n23\n28\n1\nIncident Location 2015/2016\nItem No. 19b \nGENERAL FACULTIES COUNCIL \nFor the Meeting of November 21, 2016 \nOUTLINE OF ISSUE \nAdvice, Discussion, Information Item  \nAgenda Title: General Appeals Committee (GAC) Annual Report to General Faculties Council (July 1, \n2015 ‚Äì June 30, 2016) \nItem   \nProposed by David Johnson, Special Advisor, Faculty and Staff Relations \nPresenter David Johnson, Special Advisor, Faculty and Staff Relations \nDetails \nResponsibility Provost and Vice-President (Academic) \nThe Purpose of the item is \n(please be specific) \nTo comply with GFC-legislated reporting requirements \nTimeline/Implementation Date N/A \nSupplementary Notes and \ncontext \nFor information \nEngagement and Routing (Include meeting dates) \nParticipation: \n(parties who have seen the \nproposal and in what capacity) \n<For further information see \nthe link posted on \nthe Governance Toolkit section \nStudent Participation Protocol> \nThose who have been informed: \n‚Ä¢ GFC Executive Committee ‚Äì October 31, 2016 \n‚Ä¢ General Faculties Council ‚Äì November 21, 2016 \nThose who have been consulted: \n‚Ä¢ N/A \nThose who are actively participating: \n‚Ä¢ N/A \nAlignment/Compliance \nAlignment with Guiding \nDocuments \nFor the Public Good  \nGOAL:  EXCEL as individuals, and together, sustain a culture that \nfosters and champions distinction and distinctiveness in teaching, \nlearning, research, and service. \nCompliance with Legislation, \nPolicy and/or Procedure \nRelevant to the Proposal \n(please quote legislation and \ninclude identifying section \nnumbers) \n1.
