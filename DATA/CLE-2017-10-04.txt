            "Presenter": " Sandra Davidson, Associate Dean (Undergraduate) Faculty of Nursing ",
            "Description": " Dr Davidson presented an overview of the undergraduate curriculum renewal process. She explained how the project was framed as a developmental evaluation research project that would address the need for a renewal and recalibration of the curriculum which had been in place for twenty years. Support for the project was sought from the Faculty and Vice-Dean Olive Yonge and Associate Dean Sandra Davidson were identified to lead the project. Dr Davidson reported that the project included large scale consultation, literature review, and data analysis, including quality assurance data on student satisfaction. This informed the philosophical and educational approaches which, in turn, were used to formulate the curriculum goals and outcomes. Dr Davidson reported that the three pillars of the renewal are: scholarship, faculty development and ongoing appraisal. She noted that implementation and evaluation items were assessed throughout curriculum design and course creation activities. She further indicated that ongoing evaluation and refinement would occur as the new curriculum rolls out. She reviewed the pedagogical approaches taken: concept based, learner-centred, and relational practice. She noted that the curriculum is structured by the movement from simple to complex, and with a relational practice focus that moves the student through guiding relationships: groups, teams, and individual. The first year provides a foundation of knowledge; the focus is on the student as an individual including what it means to be a nurse and the development of self-awareness. The focus in year two widens to look at groups and teams in patient care with a scope beyond the individual to the community. Year three provides students with global perspective and an introduction to population systems based care. This would be done through a concept based curriculum that focuses on enduring concepts of what the profession is. Dr Davidson noted the difficulties in keeping pace with the rate of knowledge creation, and that the concepts for this curriculum focus on how to provide an education when future settings are not known. Dr Davidson focused on how the new curriculum would offer improved learning opportunities for students by restructuring the connection of theory to practice. This would be accomplished through scheduling classroom, lab, and clinical experiences within the same week so that the theory and concepts taught in the classroom are cemented in the lab and then students have clinical practice to learn how to apply the knowledge. By scheduling in this way, she noted, there would be less relearning for students as occurs when there is too much time between the classroom and practice. Dr Davidson noted the other organizing frameworks used in the renewal: nursing process, simple to complex, individual to group, determinants of health, and across the lifespan. She noted that graduates of this new curriculum would develop strong innovative leadership skills, integrate evidence, and appreciate the role of research. The education received would equip graduates with the skills to be agents of change. During the implementation of the new curriculum in fall 2018, Dr Davidson noted that evaluation would start immediately and would continue as an ongoing process, and that the role of faculty development was essential to the success of the program. Discussion: The committee discussed graduate outcomes and how the proposed curriculum aligns with provincial and national requirements. Regarding resource implications, Dr Davidson noted the significant resource requirements for the problem based learning currently used would be reallocated and, in combination with specific, dedicated faculty development, would be used for the new curriculum. A member asked how this would impact graduate programs; Dr Davidson noted that consultation had occurred with graduate students and many were engaged in the research team. She further noted that the proposed curriculum aligns with national competencies which are articulated into masters programs and that, additionally, the leadership component of the new program feeds well into the advanced practice graduate programs in the Faculty. Members discussed international opportunities for students; it was indicated that there is a global health office in the Faculty and that existing opportunities would be enhanced. A question arose about participation in the course INT D 410 Interprofessional Health Team Development. Dr Davidson noted that, to date, nursing students did not receive the full benefit of this course as they entered at a different level than others in the course; the new course will provide students with a clearer vision of their role and how they contribute in a team environment. Members discussed how data would be gathered on confidence and resiliency. Dr Davidson noted that there are validated and reliable measures/surveys on resiliency that will be used to evaluate student outcomes in this area. Dr Davidson noted that there would be a follow up report on the curriculum renewal.",

Those who choose not to attend must assume whatever \nrisks are involved. In connection to this students should review the following sections. \nThe University recognizes that occasionally life events occur that require a student to miss term \nwork, term examinations, or final examinations. However, excused absences are not granted \nautomatically and will be considered only for acceptable reasons such as incapacitating mental \nand/or physical illness, severe domestic affliction, or for circumstances as described in the \nUniversity's Discrimination, Harassement and Duty to Accommodate Policy (including religious \nbelief). This policy is available on the University of Alberta Policies and Procedures Online \n(UAPPOL) website at https://policiesonline.ualberta.ca. A multi-faith calendar is available \nat www.registrarsoffice.ualberta.ca/Calendar/Academic-Schedule.aspx. \nUnacceptable reasons include, but are not limited to personal events such as vacations, \nweddings, or travel arrangements. When a student is absent without acceptable excuse, a final \ngrade will be computed using a raw score of zero for the work missed. Any student who applies \nfor or obtains an excused absence by making false statements will be liable under the Code of \nStudent Behaviour. Students should consult their Faculty for detailed information and \nrequirements. \nFailure to follow the policies outlined below may result in denial of a student's request. Students \nwith concerns should see Procedures for Registering Complaints about Marking, Grading, and \nRelated Issues. Students should also review individual Faculty appeal policies posted on \nFaculty websites. \n1. Absence from Term Work \nApproval for an excused absence from term work (e.g., classes, labs, assignments, quizzes, \nterm papers, reports, or term examinations) is at the discretion of the instructor. \na. To apply for an excused absence where the cause is incapacitating mental and/or physical \nillness and most other cases including severe domestic affliction, a student must inform the \ninstructor(s) within two working days following the scheduled date of the term work or term \nexam missed, or as soon as the student is able, having regard to the circumstances underlying \nthe absence. \nb. For an excused absence where the cause is religious belief, a student must contact the \ninstructor(s) within two weeks of the start of Fall or Winter classes; and within three days of the \nstart of Spring or Summer classes. \nc. All other accommodation requests covered by the Duty to Accommodate Procedure should be \ndiscussed with the instructor(s) as soon as the student is able, having regard to the underlying \ncircumstance. \nIn all cases, instructors may request adequate documentation to substantiate the reason for the \nabsence at their discretion such as a form from the student's Faculty or a statutory declaration. \nAlthough a medical note cannot be required, if a student chooses to provide a medical note, \nthe University of Alberta Medical Statement Form may be downloaded from the Online Services \nsection of www.registrarsoffice.ualberta.ca \nhttps://policiesonline.ualberta.ca/\nhttp://www.registrarsoffice.ualberta.ca/Calendar/Academic-Schedule.aspx\nhttp://calendar.ualberta.ca/content.php?catoid=20&navoid=4939#procedures-for-registering-complaints-about-marking,-grading,-and-related-issues:\nhttp://calendar.ualberta.ca/content.php?catoid=20&navoid=4939#procedures-for-registering-complaints-about-marking,-grading,-and-related-issues:\nhttp://www.registrarsoffice.ualberta.ca/\nUniversity of Alberta Calendar 2017-2018 \nAcademic Regulations \n2. Absence from Final Exams: A student who has missed a final exam because of incapacitating \nmental and/or physical illness, severe domestic affliction or for circumstances as described in \nthe University's Discrimination, Harassment and Duty to Accommodate Policy (including \nreligious belief) may apply for a deferred exam. \na. To apply for a deferred exam where the cause is incapacitating mental and/or physical illness \nand most other cases including severe domestic affliction, a student must present supporting \ndocumentation pertaining to the absence to their Faculty office within two working days following \nthe scheduled date of the exam missed, or as soon as the student is able, having regard to the \ncircumstances underlying the absence. \nb. To apply for a deferred exam where the cause is religious belief, students must inform their \nFaculty office within two weeks of the start of Fall or Winter classes; and within three days of the \nstart of Spring or Summer classes. \nc. All other accommodation requests covered by the Discrimination, Harassment and Duty to \nAccommodate Policy should be discussed with the student's Faculty within two working days \nfollowing the scheduled date of the exam missed, or as soon as the student is able, having \nregard to the circumstances underlying the absence. \nd. In all cases, Faculties may request adequate documentation to substantiate the reason for the \nabsence at their discretion such as a Faculty specific form or a statutory declaration. Although a \nmedical note cannot be required, if a student chooses to provide a medical note, the University \nof Alberta Medical Statement Form may be downloaded from the Online Services section \nof www.registrarsoffice.ualberta.ca \ne. A deferred exam will not be approved if a student \ni. has not been in regular attendance where attendance and/or participation are required, \nand/or, \nii. excluding the final exam, has completed less than half of the assigned work. \nf. Students with two or more deferred exams outstanding from a previous term may be required to \nreduce the number of courses in which they are registered. \ng. The student must seek the approval of the dean or designate of the student's Faculty on the \napplication for a deferred final exam, If approved, students should refer to Deferred Final \nExams for details on writing deferred exams. \nh. In the case of an approved application for deferred final exam, the student's Faculty will inform \nthe Department responsible for the course of the approved deferred exam. The Department will \nthen notify the instructor. \nhttp://www.registrarsoffice.ualberta.ca/\nhttp://calendar.ualberta.ca/content.php?catoid=20&navoid=4939#deferred-final-exams\nhttp://calendar.ualberta.ca/content.php?catoid=20&navoid=4939#deferred-final-exams\nUniversity of Alberta Calendar 2017-2018 \nAcademic Regulations \nEvaluation Procedures and Grading System \n1. Weighting of Term Work and Final Examinations: In each course in which a final \nexamination is held, a weight of not less than 30 percent and not more than 70 percent will be \nassigned to the final examination, except where a departure from this arrangement has been \nauthorized by the council of the Faculty in which the department offering the course is situated. \nThe remaining weight for the course will be assigned to term work. \n2. Course Requirements, Evaluation Procedures and Grading: The policies set out below are \nintended to provide instructors and their students with general course information. GFC, in \napproving these guidelines, expected that there would be a common sense approach to their \napplication and understood that circumstances might develop, during a term, where a change to \nthe course outline, as set out in Course Requirements, Evaluation Procedures and Grading a., \nmade sense to all concerned. Such changes shall only occur with fair warning or general class \nconsent. \nStudents concerned about the application of these guidelines should consult, in turn, the \ninstructor, the chair of the department by which the course is offered, and the dean of the faculty \nin which the course is offered. \na. At the beginning of each course, instructors are required by GFC to provide a course outline to \nstudents and their Department (or Faculty in non-Departmentalized Faculties) that includes the \nfollowing: \ni. a statement of the course objectives and general content \nii. a list of the required textbooks and other major course materials \niii. a list of any other course fees as described in the 'Student Instructional Support Fees \nPolicy' and their associated costs \niv. an indication of how and when students have access to the instructor \nv. the distribution of weight between term work and final examination \nvi. the relative weight of all term work contributing to the course grade \nvii. whether marks are given for class participation and other in-class activities as well as the \nweight of such participation \nviii. dates of any examination and course assignments with a weight of 10% or more of the \noverall course grade \nix. the process by which the term marks will be translated into a final letter grade for the \ncourse. The process must be consistent with the University of Alberta Assessment \nPolicy and accompanying Grading Procedure, found at the University of Alberta Policies \nand Principles Online (UAPPOL) website at https://policiesonline.ualberta.ca. \nx. an indication of how students will be given access to past or representative evaluative \ncourse material, consistent with the Access to Evaluative Material Procedure of the \nAssessment Policy, found at the University of Alberta Policies and Procedures Online \n(UAPPOL) website at https://policiesonline.ualberta.ca. \nxi. the statement: \"Policy about course outlines can be found in Course Requirements, \nEvaluation Procedures and Grading of the University Calendar\". \nxii. the statement: \"The University of Alberta is committed to the highest standards of \nacademic integrity and honesty. Students are expected to be familiar with these \nstandards regarding academic honesty and to uphold the policies of the University in this \nrespect.

Nothing in any course outline, syllabus or course website can override or contravene any \nCalendar regulation or University policy. In resolving any discrepancy, University policy and \nCalendar regulations take precedence. \nc. Instructors may indicate in the course outline the date, time and place on which the deferred \nexamination for the course will occur, should one be required. See Deferred Final Exams. \nd. At the beginning of a course, Instructors will discuss with their class the expectations with \nrespect to academic integrity and outline both permitted and prohibited behaviour. \ne. Every course outline must contain the following statement: \"Audio or video recording, digital or \notherwise, of lectures, labs, seminars or any other teaching environment by students is allowed \nonly with the prior written consent of the instructor or as a part of an approved accommodation \nplan. Student or instructor content, digital or otherwise, created and/or used within the context of \nthe course is to be used solely for personal study, and is not to be used or distributed for any \nother purpose without prior written consent from the content author(s). \nf. Each assessment is linked to the stated course objectives and/or learning outcomes. Students \nshould be provided with the criteria for these assessments early in and, if necessary, throughout \nthe course. \ng. Instructors will allow students a reasonable time in which to complete an assignment, bearing in \nmind its weight. \nh. Instructors will mark, provide appropriate feedback, and return to students all term work in a \ntimely manner. Substantive feedback should be provided prior to the course withdrawal \ndeadline. See the University of Alberta Assessment and Grading Policy \nat https://policiesonline.ualberta.ca. \ni. Normally term work will be returned on or by the last day of classes in the course, with the \nexception of a final major assignment (which may be due on the last day of classes), which will \nbe returned by the date of the scheduled final examination or, in non-examination courses, by \nthe last day of the examination period. All exceptions must be authorized by the Faculty Council \n(or delegate) in the Faculty offering the course. \nj. Upon request, instructors are required to provide the process used to generate the final grade. \n3. Procedures for Registering Complaints about Marking, Grading, and Related Issues: \na. Where the above guidelines have not been followed or where students have concerns about the \ninstructor's marking and grading, the student should make the concern known to the appropriate \nindividual in the following sequence: \ni. Instructor \nii. Chair of the department in which the course is taught \niii. Dean of the Faculty in which the course is taught (some Faculties have delegated this \nauthority to departments) \n . A student needing advice on these matters should see an advisor in the Student \nOmbudService. \na. These procedures do not constitute a mechanism for appeals and grievances regarding the \nacademic standing or individual grades of a student. Appeals and grievances of that nature are \ndealt with in Appeals and Grievances of the Calendar. \n4. Assigning Grades: Grades reflect judgements of student achievement made by instructors and \nmust correspond to the associated descriptor. These judgements are based on a combination of \nabsolute achievement and relative performance in a class. Faculties may define acceptable \ngrading practices in their disciplines. Such grading practices must align with the University of \nhttp://calendar.ualberta.ca/content.php?catoid=20&navoid=4939#deferred-final-exams\nhttps://policiesonline.ualberta.ca/\nhttp://calendar.ualberta.ca/content.php?catoid=20&navoid=4939#Appeals_and_Grievances\nUniversity of Alberta Calendar 2017-2018 \nAcademic Regulations \nAlberta Assessment and Grading Policy and it procedures, which are available online at the \nUniversity of Alberta Policies and Procedures Online (UAPPOL) website \n(https://policiesonline.ualberta.ca). \nCourse Grades Obtained by Undergraduate Students: \nDescriptor Letter Grade G    \nExcellent \nA+  \nA    \nA-  \nGood \nB+  \nB    \nB-  \nSatisfactory \nC+  \nC    \nC-  \nPoor D+  \nMinimal Pass D    \nFailure F or F4  \nNote: F4 denotes eligibility of a student to apply for a reexamination of a course. \nCourse Grades Obtained by Graduate Students: \nDescriptor Letter Grade G    \nExcellent \nA+  \nA   \nA-  \nGood B+  B    \nSatisfactory B-  C+  \nFailure \nC    \nC-  \nD+  \nD    \nF   \n5.

Courses may be graded on a pass/fail or credit/no credit basis upon specific approval of the \nappropriate Faculty Council. \n7. Grade Point Average (GPA): All courses have been assigned an appropriate weighting factor, \nwhich along with a student's grade point values, enables the Registrar's Office or the Dean's \noffice to compute the Grade Point Average. \nThe Grade Point Average (GPA) is a measure of a student's weighted average, obtained by \ndividing the total number of grade points earned by the total units of course weight attempted. \nRules for Computing the GPA \na. The GPA for any period is based on the final grades, including failing grades in all \ncourses taken during a specified period. \nb. GPAs are calculated according to the following formula: GPA = sum of [grade point value \nx units of course weight] sum of units of course weight  \n  GPA = sum of [grade point value x units of course weight]   \n  sum of units of course weight   \nc. A reexamination mark or a deferred examination mark replaces the original final \nexamination mark. The revised final grade is included in the computation of the GPA. \nd. When a student has a deferred, incomplete or a missing grade, the GPA is not computed \nuntil a final grade is reported. \ne. Grades of IN5 are counted as numeric grades of 0.00 in the computation of any GPA. \nf. Grades of W (withdrew) are excluded from the computation of the GPA. \ng. Grades of CR and NC are not included in the computation of any GPA. \nh. Any GPA is rounded to the nearest decimal place using standard rounding rules - that is it \nis rounded up with a value of 5 or greater in the first nonsignificant place and rounded \ndown with a value of 4 or less in the first nonsignificant place \nTypes of Grade Point Averages: Faculties may use different averages for various \ndecisions regarding academic standing, promotions, and graduation, as long as these \nhave been approved by General Faculties Council. Such averages are descriptively \nlabelled. \na. Admission Grade Point Averages (AGPA) see Transfer from a Postsecondary \nInstitutions. \nb. Fall/Winter and/or Spring/Summer Grade Point Averages are reported on transcripts \nand is used by most Faculties to determine academic standing. \nc. Term Grade Point Average may be calculated at the end of Fall, Winter, Spring or \nSummer, and used to determine eligibility for reexamination (see Reexaminations). \nhttp://calendar.ualberta.ca/content.php?catoid=20&navoid=4953#transfer_from_a_postsecondary_institutions\nhttp://calendar.ualberta.ca/content.php?catoid=20&navoid=4953#transfer_from_a_postsecondary_institutions\nhttp://calendar.ualberta.ca/content.php?catoid=20&navoid=4939#reexaminations\nUniversity of Alberta Calendar 2017-2018 \nAcademic Regulations \nd. Promotion and Graduation Grade Point Averages are Faculty specific and are defined \nin the Faculty sections of the Calendar. \ne. Faculty Grade Point Average (FGPA): The Faculty Grade Point Average (FGPA) is a \ncumulative measure of a student's grade points obtained while registered in a Faculty in \nall years and terms, including Spring/Summer. FGPA is a weighted average obtained by \ndividing the total grade points earned by the total units of course weight attempted. The \nFGPA is currently used by the Faculty of Arts. \nRules for Computing the FGPA \ni. The rules related to calculation of GPA [see Grade Point Average (GPA)] also apply \nto the calculation of FGPA. \nii. The initial assessment and any subsequent reassessment of academic standing \nusing FGPA is based on a student's performance in a minimum of nine units of \ncourse weight (★9). If, at the time of review, the student has attempted less than ★\n9 since the last assessment while registered in the Faculty, the assessment will be \ndeferred until the next assessment period. \niii. Assessments are performed at the end of a student's registration in Fall/Winter (or \nat the end of a student's program) and are based upon the final grades in all \ncourses taken in that and prior periods while registered in the Faculty. At the \ndiscretion of the faculty an assessment may also be performed at the end of a \nstudent's registration in Spring/Summer. \niv. If a student is required to withdraw and subsequently allowed to continue (after a \nsuccessful appeal or after successfully completing required work at another \ninstitution) the FGPA will be calculated from the term in which readmission or \ncontinuation is granted, not from the time of first admission into the Faculty. Such a \nrestart of FGPA will be allowed only once for any student in a Faculty. \nv. Students continuing in a Faculty following a restarted FGPA as described above \nmust thereafter maintain a minimum FGPA of 2.0. \n8. Aegrotat Standing: Aegrotat standing may be granted, in special circumstances, on the \ngrounds of illness to deserving students who have completed at least one year at the University \nof Alberta in the Faculty in which they are currently registered. Any student wishing to take \nadvantage of this privilege should apply without delay to the dean of the Faculty concerned. Any \nother student absent from a final examination because of illness may apply for permission to \nwrite the regular deferred examination. \n9. Competence in Written Work: General Faculties Council urges all instructors of University \nundergraduate courses to provide that suitable portions of course testing or other course work \nshould be in the form of written essay responses and to emphasize to students that competence \nin written work is integral to competence in a subject and will constitute part of the basis on \nwhich the student's course grade is determined. \nAll instructors should make clear at the outset of each course their expectations in regard to the \nstandard and importance of writing in assignments and examinations. \n10. Official Grades: Student grades are unofficial until they have been approved by the appropriate \nFaculty Council or delegate at the end of Fall/Winter or Spring/Summer. Prior to approval by \nFaculty Council, unofficial grades are reported on transcripts and so noted. Students can \ngenerally expect that official grades will be available in early June for Fall/Winter, and early \nSeptember for Spring/Summer. Students obtain their Statement of Results on Bear Tracks \n(https://www.beartracks.ualberta.ca) following the approval of grades. \nhttp://calendar.ualberta.ca/content.php?catoid=20&navoid=4939#grade-point-average-(gpa)\nhttps://www.beartracks.ualberta.ca/\nUniversity of Alberta 2017-2018 \nAcademic Regulations \nExaminations (Exams) \nConduct of Exams \nNote: Conduct which violates the rules of conduct for exams may also violate the Code of \nStudent Behaviour. Amendments to the Code of Student Behaviour occur throughout the year. \nThe official version of the Code of Student Behaviour, as amended from time to time is housed \non the University Governance website at www.governance.ualberta.ca. \nIn this section, \"term exam\" is used to refer to any written or oral exam, test or quiz (other than a \nfinal exam) which is scheduled as part of the term work of a course. \n1. Student Identification: Students writing exams are required to confirm their identities by \nproviding their student ID numbers and signatures and by presenting their student ID cards \n(ONEcard) or other acceptable photo identification. Students who are unable to present \nsatisfactory identification at the time of the exam will be permitted to write the exam, but will be \nrequired to present themselves with acceptable photo identification to the instructor of the \ncourse within two working days of the exam and may be required to provide a sample of their \nhandwriting. Failure to provide proper identification will result in a mark of zero for the exam. \nInstructors are advised to circulate an attendance sheet at all exams. \n2. Permitted References and Aids: Only those items specifically authorized by the instructor may \nbe brought into the exam facility. The use of unauthorized personal listening, communication, \nrecording, photographic and/or computational devices is strictly prohibited. \n3. Registration: Students may not be present in an exam or write an exam in a course section in \nwhich they are not registered. \n4. Arriving and Leaving: Students may not enter the exam area after the first half-hour has \nelapsed, and they may not leave the exam area until one half-hour has elapsed. \n5. Communications: During the exam, all communications should be addressed to a supervisor. \nStudents should not, under any circumstances, speak to or communicate with other candidates \nor leave their answer papers exposed to view. \n6. Brief Absence from an Exam: Students who need to visit the washroom during an exam must \nleave their papers in the custody of a supervisor and retrieve it upon return. \n7. Cancellation of Paper During Exam: If a student becomes incapacitated because of illness or \nreceives word of domestic affliction during the course of an exam, the student should report at \nonce to the Supervisor, hand in the unfinished paper, and request that it be cancelled. \nThereafter, if illness is the cause, the student may go directly to the University Health Centre or \nother medical practitioner so that any subsequent application for a deferred exam may be \nsupported by a medical note. If a student chooses to provide a medical note, the University of \nAlberta Medical Statement Form may be downloaded from the Online Services section \nof www.registrarsoffice.ualberta.ca. Medical notes cannot be required. Alternatively, students \nmay provide supporting documentation by way of a form from the student's Faculty or a \nstatutory declaration. In cases other than illness, adequate documentation must be provided. \na. For final exams, the student must provide documentation and apply to their Faculty for a \ndeferred exam within two working days following the cancelled final exam or as soon as the \nstudent is able, having regard to the circumstances underlying the cancellation. Students should \nconsult their Faculty for detailed information on requirements. Also see Absence from Final \nExams for details. \nb. For other exams, instructors may use their discretion to request supporting documentation. The \nstudent must contact the instructor within two working days of the exam or as soon as the \nhttp://www.governance.ualberta.ca/\nhttp://www.registrarsoffice.ualberta.ca/\nhttp://calendar.ualberta.ca/content.php?catoid=20&navoid=4939#absence-from-final-exams\nhttp://calendar.ualberta.ca/content.php?catoid=20&navoid=4939#absence-from-final-exams\nUniversity of Alberta 2017-2018 \nAcademic Regulations \nstudent is able, having regard to the circumstances underlying the cancellation and present \nsupporting documentation to the instructor if requested. \nShould a student write an exam, hand in the paper for marking, and later report extenuating \ncircumstances to support a request for cancellation of the paper and for another exam, such \nrequest will not be entertained. Any student who requests a cancellation of their paper and \nsubsequently applies for or obtains an excused absence by making false statements will be \nliable under the Code of Student Behaviour. \n8. End of Exam: When the signal is given to end the exam, students must promptly cease writing. \nIf a student does not stop at the signal, the instructor has the discretion either not to grade the \nexam paper or to lower the grade on the examination. \nTerm Examinations \n1. Term Examinations Optional: The holding of term examinations is optional within each \ndepartment. \n2. Instructors may schedule term examinations during any regularly scheduled class period. In \ncertain cases an instructor may schedule a term examination outside or beyond the regularly \nscheduled class period. Instructors should be aware that by doing so, conflicts may result for \nsome students that have another class at the time of the scheduled term examinations. \nStudents have the right to attend regularly scheduled class activities. Therefore, if a student has \na conflict between a regularly scheduled class and a scheduled term examination, the instructor \nof the class in which there was a scheduled term examination will be required to make an \naccommodation for the student. \nFinal Examinations \nThere is no requirement by General Faculties Council that the final examination must be written \nin order to obtain credit: Faculties are permitted to make their own regulations in this regard. \n1. Final Examinations: A final examination is held in each course except where departure from \nthis arrangement has been authorized by the Faculty council governing the department offering \nthe course. Final examinations for Fall courses shall be held in December. Final examinations \nfor Winter or two-term Fall/Winter courses shall be held in April. Final examinations for Spring \ncourses shall be held in June. Final examinations for Summer or two-term Spring/Summer \ncourses shall be held in August. Examinations for evening credit program and late afternoon \nand evening courses are to be held during the last regular class period, excluding Augustana \nFaculty. Final examinations in Augustana Faculty evening courses are to be held in the evening \nduring the regular examination period. \n2. Examination Schedule: The schedule of Fall and Winter Terms final examinations (and mid-\nterm examinations in two-term courses) shall be related directly to the basic University \ntimetable. \nWhere possible, the final examination schedule for Augustana Faculty courses shall be related \ndirectly to the basic University timetable. Some dates may vary. Students should also \nsee Attendance, Evaluations and Grading. \nIn the Faculty of Education, for those Faculty courses which form part of a professional term and \nhence do not conform to the standard timetable, the scheduling of the final examinations shall \nbecome the responsibility of the Faculty. \nIn the MBA program final examinations in all evening courses shall be scheduled into the week \nimmediately following the last week of classes in each term in order to allow for equal \ninstructional hours in the full- and part-time programs. \nhttp://calendar.ualberta.ca/content.php?catoid=20&navoid=4996#attendance,-evaluations-and-grading\nUniversity of Alberta 2017-2018 \nAcademic Regulations \nFinal examinations or mid-term examinations in two-term courses shall not exceed three hours \nin length. \nThe Examination Schedule shall be adhered to and no attempt made to adjust examination \nschedules to accommodate students who have failed a course and are repeating without \nattendance. \nNormally there shall be no departure from the official Final Examination Schedule. Instructors \nand students may, however, petition the Faculty Council concerned for permission to depart \nfrom the Schedule if justified reasons can be established. No departures shall be considered for \napproval unless the instructor of the class concerned and every student registered for credit in \nthe class have given their written consent. Such consent shall take the form of either written \nletters or signed and dated forms made available from the Dean's office. These notices of \nconsent shall be conveyed to the Dean of the Faculty offering the course on an individual \nbasis at least one month prior to the new dates being requested. If and when unanimous \nconsent is received from the class, this fact shall be communicated to both the instructor \ninvolved and the Faculty Council. All such notices of consent shall be received by the Dean, in \nconfidence, and it will not be the Dean's responsibility to insure that all members of the class \nhave been informed of the need to submit such written consents. This will be the responsibility \nof the Instructor or of those members of the class who have initiated the request for a change in \nthe examination date. \nNote: Permission to depart from the Final Examination Schedule may be authorized by the \nDean in Faculties where the Faculty Council has delegated this responsibility to the Dean. \nThe requirement that notices of consent for departures from the official Final Examination \nSchedule shall be conveyed to the Dean at least one month prior to the new date being \nrequested, shall be rigidly enforced. \nThe rescheduling of examinations or tests in the final week of classes is not permitted. \n3. Where a final examination has been scheduled, students registered in the course may not be \nbarred from writing that final examination. \n4. Marking of Examinations: Departments and instructors shall be informed that the marking of \nexaminations be given first priority in order to expedite the submission of grades to the \nRegistrar. \nNo member of a Department shall be permitted to go away taking the original examinations \npapers with them for marking without permission of the unit head. In a case where a member of \na Department applies for leave before the end of term, this will only be granted on condition that \nthe head of the Department arranges for the papers to be marked here in the usual way. \nAll examinations and assignments shall be marked only by the instructor(s) or by persons \nexpressly authorized by the Department Chair (or by the Dean in non-departmentalized \nFaculties) to mark them. \nIn the case where the student has missed the final examination, the instructor shall compute \nand record the course grade for that student with a score of zero for the final examination. The \ninstructor must enter the remark \"1\" to indicate that the student was absent from the final \nexamination. \n5. The following discretionary policy on student access to final examination papers was affirmed by \nGeneral Faculties Council: \nDepartments subscribing to the belief that there is educational value in permitting students to \nsee their final examination papers after they have been marked are not only at liberty, but are \nencouraged, to make the papers available on request, and to allow for discussion where \npossible; that the objective here is an educational end: i.e., it is not a substitute for existing \nreappraisal procedures for the reconciliation of grades; that where the department is prepared to \ngrant outright release of the paper it must not do so until the deadline for applications for \nreappraisal has passed, since an appeal cannot be entertained after the custody of the paper \nhas been relinquished to the student. \nUniversity of Alberta 2017-2018 \nAcademic Regulations \n6. Grades of Incomplete: The grade of \"incomplete\" (IN) is normally awarded when an \nundergraduate student is prevented by illness, domestic affliction, or other extreme \ncircumstance from submitting an assignment by the end of term. When a grade of IN is \nawarded, the student is required to submit the assignment within 10 days after the end of the \nfinal examination period of the term for the course. At the request of the Department Chair \nconcerned, the student's Dean may grant an extension of time to a maximum of four months \nafter the end of the term. If the assignment is not submitted by the prescribed deadline, the \nRegistrar will record a grade of \"NC\" or a grade of \"F\" plus a remark of \"1\", as appropriate. \nBefore finalizing the student's grade the Office of the Registrar will give 30 days written notice to \nthe student's Faculty and to the Department in which the course is offered. \nNotification of Results \n1. Release of Grades: Only the Registrar's Office is authorized to issue official statements of \nresults or transcripts. An official statement of final grades in courses for each Fall/Winter and \nSpring/Summer period is available on Bear Tracks (https://www.beartracks.ualberta.ca). Official \nstatements are provided at the following times: \n  Students registered in statement available \n  Fall Term only early February \n  Fall/Winter Terms late May \n  Spring Term only early July \n  Spring/Summer Terms late August/early September \nDepartments shall approve grades within five working days of the final exam, or (for \ncourses with no final exam) within five working days of the due date for the final \nassignment. For courses with consolidated examinations, Departments shall approve \ngrades within ten working days of the final exam. (For the Faculty of Law grades should \nbe approved no later than the third day of classes in the Winter Term for Fall Term \ncourses, or May 31 for Winter Term or Fall/Winter courses.) \nUnofficial final course grades are available to students on Bear Tracks \n(https://www.beartracks.ualberta.ca). Grades for courses that are completed in the first \nhalf of the term are available mid-term. \nStudents should consult the Registrar's website at www.registrarsoffice.ualberta.ca for \ninformation on how to obtain their grades on Bear Tracks. \nDepartments may, but are not required to, post unofficial results in alternate formats, \nprovided the confidentiality of the students' records is preserved in accordance with \nthe Freedom of Information and Protection of Privacy Act. This precludes incorporating \nnames or, potentially, information such as Faculty, degree, or year in program if the \nidentity of the student can be deduced from this information. Because it is very difficult to \nprotect student confidentiality in small classes (less than 25 students), departments \nshould refrain from posting grades for these courses. \n2. Reappraisals: Since great care is taken in marking final examination papers, a student should \napply for reappraisal of a paper only if the student has good reason to believe that a mistake \nhas been made. Reappraisals are dealt with by the Chair of the department in consultation with \nmembers of the staff. A request for reappraisal must be made in writing to the Faculty or \nDepartment Office responsible for the course by February 1 in the case of Fall courses, by June \n22 for other Fall/Winter courses, and within thirty days of the publication of results for courses \noffered in Spring/Summer. The request must include a statement of whether the intent of the \nappeal is to raise or lower the grade. If a student fails to include such a statement it will be \nassumed that the intent is to have the grade raised. Refer to Obtaining and Paying Your Fee \nAssessment for details on where to pay fees and to 2016-2017 Schedule of Fees for Special \nServices  for fees for special services. Payment of the required fee will normally be made at the \nhttps://www.beartracks.ualberta.ca/\nhttps://www.beartracks.ualberta.ca/\nhttp://www.registrarsoffice.ualberta.ca/\nhttp://calendar.ualberta.ca/content.php?catoid=20&navoid=4986#obtaining-and-paying-your-fee-assessment\nhttp://calendar.ualberta.ca/content.php?catoid=20&navoid=4986#obtaining-and-paying-your-fee-assessment\nhttp://calendar.ualberta.ca/content.php?catoid=20&navoid=4986#2016-2017-schedule-of-fees-for-special-services\nhttp://calendar.ualberta.ca/content.php?catoid=20&navoid=4986#2016-2017-schedule-of-fees-for-special-services\nUniversity of Alberta 2017-2018 \nAcademic Regulations \ntime of the request but must be made no later than two weeks after submission of the request; \nthe fee will be refunded if the appeal is successful. \nThe privilege of having papers reappraised applies only to final examinations. A student may \napply for reappraisal of no more than two final examination papers in each term of the \nFall/Winter. A student enrolled in the Spring/Summer will be limited to two reappraisals. \nIt should be understood that if the grade is changed, the new grade, whether higher or lower \nthan the original, replaces it as the student's official grade in the course. \nReexaminations \n1. Undergraduate students who have written and submitted a final examination may be considered \nfor a reexamination provided the following conditions are met. Students in Medicine and \nDentistry should consult Academic Standing and Graduation and the Faculty Office for these \nregulations. Students in Business should consult Reexaminations. Students in Science should \nconsult Reexamination. Reexaminations are not permitted for graduate students. \na. The course was failed. \nb. The final examination is 40 percent or greater, as originally scheduled for the class as a whole. \nc. For a Fall Term course, the student achieved a Term Grade Point Average of 2.0 inclusive of \nthe failed course. For Winter Term and Fall/Winter courses, a Fall/Winter GPA of 2.0 inclusive of \nthe failed course. \nd. Students are advised that it may not be possible to make a ruling until all grades for a term or \ntwo-term period are recorded. Students for whom a term GPA cannot be computed at the end of \nthe Fall Term will have to wait for the computation of a GPA following the Winter Term.
