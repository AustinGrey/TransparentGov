            "Description": "Purpose of the Proposal: To discuss the Report of the GFC ad hoc Committee on Academic Governance Including Delegated Authority and proposed changes to the Committee's Terms of Reference. Discussion: The Chair provided an overview of the GFC ad hoc Committee Report and Recommendations, noting that GFC had approved four foundational documents related to the role and responsibilities of members, committee composition, delegations of authority and procedural rules and had endorsed the final report at the GFC meeting of April 21, 2017. GFC Secretary Ms Meg Brolley reported that the recommendations included changes to the committee’s Terms of Reference to include a stronger link between GFC and its standing committees to more clearly articulate the mandate of the committee. She noted that draft changes to the Terms of Reference as presented would require refinement by the committee prior to being presented at GFC for approval. During the discussion in relation to the report and recommendations, members discussed the importance of committee orientation for members of UASC and the possible disadvantages of limiting committee membership to GFC members. Members also discussed the role of the Nominating Committee in selecting members for UASC. The Chair led members through a review of the proposed Terms of Reference. Initially, members suggested adding the official definitions of all types of awards to the Definitions section of the Terms of Reference. Members discussed the mandate of the committee, and noted that the committee rarely reviews existing policies governing student awards, but perhaps could beginning in 2017 on a regular basis, as part of the committee work plan. Members also expressed the need to include For the Public Good as well as other strategic documents to the Terms of Reference. During this discussion, members sought clarification about how the mandate of the committee could be strengthened to provide the academy with more specific, strategic advice on undergraduate awards and scholarships and the types of awards which would best suit the needs of the students. In regards to composition of the committee, members suggested applying the Faculty diversity limitations across all categories of membership, and suggested an increase in threshold from one to two representatives from any Faculty. Members determined that three academic staff members from GFC would be the appropriate balance. Members discussed whether the role of the Development Specialist should be formalized within the Terms of Reference. The Chair thanked members for their comments and stated that this item would be brought back for further discussion.",

List of consultations – ad hoc Committee on Academic Governance Including Delegated Authority \nPrepared by: University Governance \n1 of 2 \nGENERAL FACULTIES COUNCIL \nPrinciples of Delegation \nPrinciples for General Faculties Council Delegation of Authority \nIntroduction \nGovernance is understood as the process through which an organization defines and achieves \nits mandate, which includes making decisions with regard to the structures, policies, and \npractices of decision-making; the exercise of authority; and the mechanisms of accountability.  \nGeneral Faculties Council (GFC) has employed a structure that relies upon the delegation of its \nprovincially-mandated authorities to its standing committees, individuals on campus and other \ncampus bodies.  Delegation is essential to ensure timely and efficient decision-making in \nsmaller forums with access to appropriate resource people, while allowing GFC to focus on \nsubstantive and strategic issues of broad relevance to the university community.  The following \noffers guidance to this delegation structure and helps maintain accountability, transparency, and \ncollegiality in the academic governance system at the University of Alberta. \nRetained Authority \nGeneral Faculties Council shall pursue major policy and strategic issues that include: \n● significant strategic and policy issues related to the academic affairs of the university;\n● any matter involving the alteration of the mandate, terms of reference, membership, or\nstructure of a GFC standing committee; and\n● those matters that a standing committee, body, or officer holding delegated authority\nfrom GFC considers to be of major strategic significance or long-term impact on the\nuniversity.\nPrinciples \n1. Delegations of authority must be reasonable in scope and appropriate to the character and\ncapacity of the body (e.g. council or committee) or officer receiving the delegated authority. \n2. An officer or body acting with delegated authority is accountable to the body which\ndelegated the authority and must report to that body in a timely and sufficiently detailed\nfashion on actions taken under the delegated authority.\n3. An officer or body is responsible to be alert to situations where, for example, there is\nuncertainty as to whether an item falls within the intended delegation or the significance of\nan issue and the division of opinion on the issue suggest it is prudent to refer the issue or\ndecision to the delegating body for consideration. When there is uncertainty as to whether\nan item falls within the intended delegated authority, or if there is clear division of opinion,\nthe officer or body with delegated authority will refer the item to the body that delegated the\nauthority along with a recommendation.\n4. Delegations should be recorded in written form and curated in a transparent manner.\n2 of 2 \nGENERAL FACULTIES COUNCIL \nPrinciples of Delegation \n 5. A body delegating authority may impose restrictions on that authority -- including restrictions \non the authority to sub-delegate -- so long as the restrictions allow sufficient authority for the \ndelegation to be meaningful. \n6. All delegations of authority should be reviewed at regular intervals (ideally once every three \nyears) to ensure they remain appropriate. \n7. Withdrawal of delegated authority should be considered judiciously based on the best \ninterest of the institution and cannot be done retroactively. \n8. An officer or body is not compelled to exercise delegations. The fact that a delegation is held \ndoes not oblige the officer or body to exercise the delegation if, in the opinion of the \ndelegate, some special or unusual circumstances are involved which make it sensible that \nthe issue should receive consideration at a more senior level. \nApproved by General Faculties Council: <insert date> \n1 of 1 \nGENERAL FACULTIES COUNCIL \nPrinciples of Committee Composition \nPrinciples for General Faculties Council Standing Committee Composition \nIntroduction \nGovernance at the University of Alberta relies upon a structure wherein the General Faculties \nCouncil has delegated many of its provincially-mandated authorities to its standing committees.  \nAs such, the composition of those standing committees is crucial to ensuring that decisions are \nmade in an informed manner that takes into account the breadth of issues, perspectives and \nopinions on campus.  The following principles provide a framework to create committee \ncompositions which are reflective of the membership of GFC and appropriate to the role and \nmandate of those committees.  \nPrinciples \n1. Wherever possible, the majority of elected members of each standing committee should be\ndrawn from the membership of GFC to provide tangible links between GFC and its standing\ncommittees and increase engagement of the greater GFC community.\n2. Wherever possible, the number of elected members of a standing committee should exceed\nthe number of ex-officio members.\n3. The voting status of ex-officio members of standing committees should be consistent with\ntheir voting status on GFC and should extend to their delegates.\n4. Ex-officio members should be included in the membership of a standing committee only\nwhen their portfolio is directly relevant to the mandate and role of the standing committee.\n5. Wherever possible, the Vice-Chair of a standing committee should be elected by the\ncommittee from its elected academic staff members and ideally be a member of GFC.\n6. Standing Committees should be populated with a commitment to diversity and broad\nrepresentation from across the university.\n7. When cross-appointment of members on standing committees is appropriate, this should be\noutlined in the terms of reference of each committee and such members shall have voting\nstatus on both committees.\nApproved by General Faculties Council: <insert date> \n1 of 2 \nGENERAL FACULTIES COUNCIL \nRoles and Responsibilities of Members \nRoles and Responsibilities of Members \nIntroduction \nGeneral Faculties Council (GFC) is the principal academic decision-making body of the \nuniversity. It is established in the Post-Secondary Learning Act (PSLA) and given authority, \nsubject to the Board of Governors, over the academic affairs of the university. \nFor GFC to be successful in fulfilling its terms of reference and meeting its responsibilities to the \nuniversity it depends on the active engagement of its members. GFC has delegated much of its \nauthority for routine matters to standing committees allowing GFC to engage in high level \nstrategic and stewardship policy issues. GFC members have the opportunity to serve on the \nstanding committees that approve matters with the delegated authority from GFC.  \nGFC operates under the principle of collegial academic governance including: \n• A commitment to inclusive and participatory governance decision-making\n• A desire to facilitate meaningful individual-level engagement in governance processes\n• A commitment to openness, transparency, and respectful communication\n• A commitment to responsiveness, respect, and reciprocity between governing bodies\nand between governing bodies and university administration\nRoles and Responsibilities of Members \n1. Understand GFC\n1.1 Members should understand that not all matters under GFC jurisdiction will come\nbefore that body for approval. Some decisions are made at the standing committee \nlevel as GFC has delegated authority to approve and report on actions taken on certain \nmatters.   \n1.2 The university operates in a bicameral governance system. Members should \nunderstand the distinction between the role and responsibilities of GFC and the Board \nof Governors. \n2. Meeting Attendance\n2.1 Members have a responsibility to attend GFC meetings.\na. If a student misses two consecutive meetings, or more than three meetings in one\nacademic year, the Students’ Union or the Graduate Students’ Association may\nrequest that the Chair declare the position vacant.\nb. If a Faculty representative or a non-student member misses two consecutive\nmeetings or more than three meetings in one academic year without a reason\nsatisfactory to the members of the GFC Executive Committee, the Executive\nCommittee shall declare the position vacant.\n2.2 Members have a responsibility to serve on GFC committees as appropriate and attend \ncommittee meetings. \na. If an elected member is absent from three consecutive meetings or is frequently\nabsent without a reason satisfactory to the remaining members of the committee, the \nChair shall declare the position vacant. \n2 of 2 \nGENERAL FACULTIES COUNCIL \nRoles and Responsibilities of Members \n2.3 Members should advise the GFC Secretary or committee coordinator if they are unable \nto attend a meeting. \n3.  Participate in GFC Business \n3.1 Members should prepare for meetings by reviewing agenda materials in advance that, \nfor open sessions, are publicly available at governance.ualberta.ca \n 3.2 Members should engage in candid and respectful discussion of matters which are \nbrought before GFC and its various bodies  \n3.3 When voting on motions: \na. Members must act in good faith with the view to the best interests of the university as \na whole. While members may be informed by matters raised by various \nconstituencies, it is the duty of a member to ensure that all constituencies are fairly \nconsidered in the process of decision making.  \nb. When notified of an e-vote, members should vote in a timely manner in order to \nensure that quorum requirements are met.  \n4.  Manage Conflict of Interest and Act Ethically \n4.1 Comply with the university’s policies and procedures regarding both ethical conduct and \nconflict of interest.  Members must declare conflicts when they arise.  \n4.2 Maintain confidentiality of all information included in closed session meetings.  \n5.  Ask Questions \n5.1 Information requests may be made of the University Governance office, should \nmembers require more information than is provided with the meeting agenda. \n5.2 If a member wishes to raise a question at GFC within the jurisdiction of the body, a \nquestion may be submitted in writing to the GFC Secretary up to six working days \nbefore the next GFC meeting to receive a written response. \n5.3 Every GFC meeting has Question Period as a standing item wherein members may \nraise a question during the time set aside for this item. Procedures for Question Period \nare available at governance.ualberta.ca \n5.4 If a member has a question with regard to an item on the agenda, it may be raised \nduring consideration of that item at the GFC meeting. \n5.5 If a member wishes to add an item to the agenda for debate, the member should \ncontact the Chair or GFC Secretary for assistance. \n6.  Communicate Information to Constituents \n6.1 Members should communicate with their Faculty or constituency regarding agenda \nitems coming before GFC.  \n6.2 Members should communicate with their Faculty or constituency on matters which were \ndiscussed/approved at GFC in Open Session. \nApproved at General Faculties Council <insert date> \nhttp://www.governance.ualberta.ca/\nhttps://policiesonline.ualberta.ca/PoliciesProcedures/Policies/Ethical-Conduct-and-Safe-Disclosure-Policy.pdf\nhttps://policiesonline.ualberta.ca/PoliciesProcedures/Policies/Conflict-Policy--Conflict-of-Interest-and-Commitment-and-Institutional-Conflict.pdf\nhttp://www.governance.ualberta.ca/GeneralFacultiesCouncil/%7E/media/Governance/Documents/GO05/GEN/Linked%20Documents%20on%20GFC%20Home%20Page/Question-Period-Excerpt-from-the-2006-GFC-PM.pdf\nhttp://www.governance.ualberta.ca/GeneralFacultiesCouncil/%7E/media/Governance/Documents/GO05/GEN/Linked%20Documents%20on%20GFC%20Home%20Page/Question-Period-Excerpt-from-the-2006-GFC-PM.pdf\n1 of 6 \nGENERAL FACULTIES COUNCIL \nMeeting Procedural Rules  \nMeeting Procedural Rules \n Introduction \nGeneral Faculties Council (GFC) has on many occasions confirmed its commitment to having a \nset of rules that assist rather than impede the conduct of business. GFC rules are not meant to \nunduly restrict debate or limit opportunities for participation. Their purpose is to facilitate \ninclusive and respectful dialogue, while ensuring efficient decision-making. It is the responsibility \nof the Chair, with the support of GFC, to employ the rules governing general meetings in a \nmanner consistent with these principles. Substantive motions should be handled with \nconsiderable formality, but whenever possible the Chair should deal with matters of procedure \nby general agreement. \nThe following rules and procedures are based on a number of fundamental principles that \nencourage participation and engagement of members. These principles include: \n• A commitment to inclusive and participatory decision-making. \n• A commitment to openness, transparency and respectful communication. \n1.  Procedural Rules  \n1.1  GFC and its standing committees are governed by the procedural rules set out below. \nFor matters not covered by these rules, or by the Post Secondary Learning Act (PSLA) \nreference shall be made to the current edition of Robert's Rules of Order. If this does \nnot provide clear direction regarding a point in question, then the Chair shall decide \nhow to proceed. However, such rulings by the Chair may be overruled via a motion \nsupported by a vote of the majority of those present.  \n1.2  The chairs of GFC and its standing committees will be responsible for guiding \nmeetings of GFC and its standing committees, enforcing rules, and deciding questions \npertaining to those rules. Any decisions of the chair are subject to challenge (see \n10.3). \n1.3 The Chair will not participate actively in debate regarding a motion before GFC without \npassing the role of the Chair to the Vice-Chair for the duration of the debate and the \nsubsequent vote.  \n2. Meetings \n 2.1 GFC and its standing committees shall meet regularly during the academic year, the \nschedule of which will be published on the governance website at least one month \nbefore the beginning of each academic year. GFC meetings will not be scheduled \nduring the period set aside for final examinations or Reading Week, however \ncommittee meetings may occur during this time. \n 2.2 Cancellation - GFC Executive Committee may cancel a meeting of GFC if it \ndetermines that the number and nature of the agenda items make it reasonable to \ndefer consideration, and provided that notice of such cancellation is given to members \nat least one week prior to the date of the meeting. The Chair of a GFC standing \ncommittee may cancel a meeting if the agenda items make it reasonable to defer \n2 of 6 \nGENERAL FACULTIES COUNCIL \nMeeting Procedural Rules   \n consideration, and provided that notice of such cancellation is given to members as \nearly as possible.  \n 2.3  From time to time, the Chair of GFC may call special meetings of GFC, provided that \nnotice of such meetings is given to members at least one month in advance.  \n 2.4 GFC meetings shall normally be scheduled and planned to end two hours after being \ncalled to order. \n 2.5 Debate on new items of business will not be entertained after GFC has been sitting for \nthree hours.  \n 2.6 No audio or video recording of meetings shall be permitted unless by express authority \nof the Chair. \n3. Open Sessions \n 3.1 Meetings of GFC and its standing committees are normally held in open session, with \nthe exception of those dealing with nominations and adjudication which are always \nheld in closed session. \n 3.2 Subject to the limitations of space and orderly conduct as determined by the chair, \nmembers of the university community and the general public may attend open \nmeetings as observers. Observers may only speak if expressly invited to do so by the \nChair.  \n4. Closed Sessions \n 4.1 From time to time, GFC or its committees may hold meetings or portions of meetings \nas closed meetings; at that point, proceedings will be confidential and all non-\nmembers, except those specifically invited, will be asked to withdraw. \n5.  Questions  \n5.1  If more information than is provided as part of the meeting agenda is required, \ninformation requests may be made of the University Governance office. \n5.2  Questions on an issue within GFC’s jurisdiction may be submitted in writing to the GFC \nSecretary up to six working days before the next GFC meeting to receive a written \nresponse. \n5.3  Every GFC meeting has Question Period as a standing item wherein members may \nraise a question during the time set aside for this item (see 6.5). Procedures for \nQuestion Period are available at governance.ualberta.ca \n5.4  Questions with regard to a specific item on an agenda may be raised during \nconsideration of that item at the GFC meeting. \n6.  Agendas \n 6.1  The agenda of each GFC meeting will be proposed by the GFC Executive Committee \nand approved by GFC. The GFC Executive Committee will ensure that items put \nbefore GFC are complete and ready for discussion and published in advance of the \nmeeting.  \nhttp://www.governance.ualberta.ca/GeneralFacultiesCouncil/%7E/media/Governance/Documents/GO05/GEN/Linked%20Documents%20on%20GFC%20Home%20Page/Question-Period-Excerpt-from-the-2006-GFC-PM.pdf\n3 of 6 \nGENERAL FACULTIES COUNCIL \nMeeting Procedural Rules   \n  6.2 If GFC members want to have an issue debated, they are asked to submit the issue to \nthe GFC Executive Committee. Whenever possible, members wishing to add items to \nthe agenda should contact the Chair or GFC Secretary two weeks in advance of the \nGFC Executive Committee meeting to allow time for the item to be added to the \nagenda. \n 6.3 Should a member wish to add an item to the agenda at a meeting of GFC, a two-thirds \nvote of those present is required; the Chair will then determine where the item appears \non the agenda. In cases where the Chair or GFC Secretary has been informed in \nadvance of a planned request to add a new item, but after the agenda has been \npublished, the proposal shall be circulated to members through the normal means. \n 6.4 When the Agenda is being approved, the Chair will entertain a request to change the \norder of items, for specified reasons.  \n 6.5 Each agenda of GFC and its standing committees will include Question Period of one \nhalf hour in length that may be extended with the approval of members.  \na. Question period is comprised of both written questions and, time permitting, \nquestions from the floor.   \nb. The Chair will rule on whether a question from the floor can be answered \nexpeditiously; if not, it will be referred to the appropriate officer for response at the \nnext meeting.  \n 6.6 Reports from standing committees are included on the GFC agenda for information \nonly. Questions may be asked for clarification, but no debate may take place on such \nitems. \n 6.7 Reports for Information may be moved to the discussion part of the agenda if a \nmember gives two days notice to the GFC Secretary to ensure that an appropriate \nperson is present to answer questions that may arise during discussion.  \n 6.8   Agendas and materials for open session meetings are posted at \ngovernance.ualberta.ca \n7. Quorum  \n 7.1 General Faculties Council -  The quorum for a GFC meeting is one-third of the total \nmembership, except in the months of May through August when the quorum shall be \none-quarter of the total membership.  \n 7.2 GFC Standing Committees – The quorum for standing committee meetings is one-half \nof the voting members or, in the case where this is an even number, one-half plus 1 \nmember.  \n 7.3 Vacancies on committees are not included when establishing quorum. \n 7.4 Maintaining quorum - A duly-called meeting which starts with a quorum present shall \nbe deemed to have a continuing quorum, notwithstanding the departure of voting \nmembers, unless the quorum is challenged by a voting member. In the event of a \nchallenge, the remaining members may choose to adjourn or continue the meeting. In \nhttp://www.governance.ualberta.ca/en/GeneralFacultiesCouncil.aspx\n4 of 6 \nGENERAL FACULTIES COUNCIL \nMeeting Procedural Rules   \n the event of a decision to continue a meeting without quorum, the minutes shall record \nthis fact and any decisions taken must be ratified at the next meeting.  \n8. Motions \n 8.1 Normally, all motions concerning substantive matters shall be published in the agenda \nmaterials. \n 8.2 All motions must be moved and seconded by members of GFC.  Motions to appoint \nnew members may only be moved and seconded by statutory members of GFC. \n 8.3 Motions pass with a majority vote, except for the following: (1) motions to add an item \nto the agenda require a two-thirds majority of those present; (2) motions to rescind a \nmotion require a two-thirds majority of total members. \n 8.4 To make a motion, a member must be recognized by the Chair. (In the interest of \nclarity and to expedite business, it is advisable to provide a written motion to the GFC \nSecretary). The person making a motion will be invited by the Chair to speak first in \nany ensuing debate. \n 8.5 Amendments to Motions - A member may make a motion to amend the wording – \nand within certain limits the meaning – of a pending motion before the pending motion \nitself is voted upon. The amendment must be germane and cannot be used to \nintroduce a new subject. An amendment is debatable. \n 8.6 Motion to Adjourn - A motion to adjourn is a motion to close the meeting. It must be \nseconded, is not debatable or amendable, and typically requires a simple majority \nvote. During the months of March and April, motions to adjourn require a two-thirds \nmajority if substantive items of business remain on the agenda.  \n 8.7 During the course of a GFC meeting, members may make a Notice of Motion for \ndebate at the next GFC meeting. In such cases GFC Executive will be responsible for \nplacement of the motion on the next GFC agenda. \n9. Motions for Specific Purposes \n 9.1 Motion to Table – Enables the pending question to be laid aside until some future \ntime. The motion cannot be debated. The mover may make a statement regarding \nwhat information they believe would be required to remove the item from the table, and \nthe proposer of the item may make a brief comment on the impact of tabling the \nmotion.  \n 9.2 Motion to Take From the Table – Brings the motion back before GFC and cannot be \ndebated. \n. \n 9.3 Motion to Reconsider an item which was voted upon at the current or the last \nmeeting. If passed, proceedings are restored to the point immediately prior to the vote \nto which it applies. \n 9.4 Motion to Rescind a Motion is only used when a Motion to Reconsider is out of time. \nMotions to Rescind require support of two-thirds of the total membership if no Notice of \nMotion was given, but only a simple majority if Notice was given.  \n5 of 6 \nGENERAL FACULTIES COUNCIL \nMeeting Procedural Rules   \n 10. Debate \n 10.1  Normally, a member may not speak for a second time until the Chair is satisfied that all \nmembers wishing to speak for their first time have done so. \n 10.2  A member who has the floor may not normally be interrupted. However, the Chair may \ninterrupt a speaker if the speaker is out of order by using unacceptable language, is \nabusive of other members, or is not speaking to the motion. If the Chair does not do \nso, a member may raise this as a point of order.  \n 10.3  Point of Order - It is the right of any member who notices a breach of the rules of \nCouncil to insist on their enforcement. If the Chair fails to notice such a breach, any \nmember may make the appropriate Point of Order, calling on the Chair for a ruling. A \nPoint of Order does not require a seconder, it is not debatable or amendable, and \ncannot be reconsidered.  \n 10.4  Calling the Question - Upon hearing a member call the question, the Chair will ask \nmembers if they are ready to vote on the motion being discussed. If there appears to \nbe opposition to closing the debate, the Chair may ask for a motion to close debate. If \nseconded, members will then vote on this motion and proceed accordingly.  \n11. Debates without Motions \n11.1  When discussion of an issue and the formal rules pertaining to making motions, \ndebate, and voting seem to be a hindrance to thoughtful discussion, the GFC agenda \ncan allow for a less structured discussion guided by the Chair and the consensus of \nthe members in attendance.  \n12. Attendance  \n 12.1 Delegates – members who serve on GFC or its standing committees by virtue of their \noffice may send a delegate; such delegates shall act with all the rights of membership.  \nThere shall be no alternates for other members. \n 12.2 GFC attendance - If a student misses two consecutive meetings or more than three \nmeetings, the Students’ Union or the Graduate Students’ Association may request that \nthe Chair declare the position vacant. If a faculty representative or a non-student \nappointed member misses two consecutive meetings or more than three meetings in \none academic year without a reason satisfactory to the members of the GFC Executive \nCommittee, the Executive Committee may declare the position vacant.  \n 12.3 Standing committee attendance - If an elected member is absent from three \nconsecutive meetings or is frequently absent without a reason satisfactory to the \nremaining members of the Committee, the Chair shall declare the position vacant.  \n13. Voting  \n 13.1 All members of GFC are charged with the responsibility of examining issues before \nCouncil and voting as they judge fit on such issues.
