Discussion: Dean Cummings, together with Vice Dean Young and Associate Dean Davidson, provided an overview of the recently approved changes to the undergraduate nursing program which will allow the Faculty to deliver an enhanced undergraduate experience to students by utilizing evidence-based, concept-based teaching which will more closely align classroom, lab and clinical learning experiences. This proposal was considered and approved by the GFC Academic Planning Committee, with delegated authority from GFC, on October 25, 2017, and was brought forward to GFC to inform and to share innovations and best practices. During the ensuing discussion, members congratulated proposers on the project and enquired about the inclusion of Indigenous health within the program, the revamped admissions criteria, how the program aligns with standards set by local and national health authorities, and the availability of clinical spaces in the community for students.",

Discussion: Dr Burshtyn provided members with a summary of the proposal to waive ELP requirements for two programs, the Master of Financial Management (MFM) and the Master of Business Administration (MBA), which would be delivered in China in Mandarin. She noted that the GFC Academic Standards Committee (ASC) decided to recommended this item to GFC rather than exercise its delegated authority for several reasons including that the proposal could set a precedent for waiving ELP when delivering international programs. Dr Maier explained that the program is geared towards senior executives in China who may not speak English and that this approach, intended to maximize learning outcomes, is utilized by several other Canadian and American universities. He added that he continues to work with the Office of the Student Ombuds to ensure students have access to resources in Mandarin related to academic misconduct. Members, during the discussion, enquired about the delivery of this program off-shore; whether there were plans to deliver programs in languages other than English at the Alberta campuses; the value of offering this program in Mandarin; whether governance structures at Chinese partner institutions are conducive to the delivery and objectives of these programs; implications on accreditation when programs are delivered off-shore; clarification about Mandarin language proficiency assessment being utilized for these programs. Members further noted that this could pose a risk to reputation for the University of Alberta; that an institutional statement on language of delivery may be useful; and, that important information can be lost in translation.",

I have highlighted some of those recent developments in the following \npages.  \nOf particular note: \n• The University Relations digital team is piloting a new homepage layout for ualberta.ca, designed \nto improve engagement and better incorporate the diverse stories of our university community.\n• We are continuing our work with Universities Canada and the U15 to advocate for the Naylor\nReport recommendations, and influence the strategic direction of federal investment in basic\nresearch.\n• We have begun working towards our financial sustainability goals outlined in Objective 22. Our\nwork includes refining and implementing several financial tools, as well as setting preliminary\nbudget planning parameters for the next 3 years.\nAs this is the final GFC meeting of 2017, I would like to wish everyone a happy holiday season and a \nrestorative winter break. I look forward to reconvening and continuing our work in the new year.   \nGENERAL FACULTIES COUNCIL\nFor the Meeting of November 27, 2017\nItem No. 3\nhttps://www.ualberta.ca/\nhttps://www.ualberta.ca/strategic-plan/institutional-priorities/financial-sustainability\n2 \nOFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT  \n2-24 South Academic Building (SAB)  |  Edmonton, Alberta, Canada T6G 2G7  |  president.ualberta.ca \nMétis Scholar Awards Endowment Fund \nOver the past several years, the Métis Scholar Awards Endowment Fund has helped support more \nthan 90 Indigenous students at the U of A. This November, the Métis Nation of Alberta and the \nRupertsland Institute bolstered the endowment with an additional $1 million gift.  \nAs we strive to attract top students from across and beyond Alberta—and build a community that \nreflects the diversity of our province and country—student financial supports like this one provide \nus with an invaluable tool.  \nThe Métis Scholar Awards endowment is now valued at more than $6 million dollars. It is one of \nthe largest endowments at the University of Alberta.  \nKEY TALKING POINT: \nAs one of Canada’s top universities, we strive to attract exceptional \nstudents from across the country. These students bring a diversity of \nideas and perspectives that strengthen our whole community.  \nBundled Admission and Residence Applications \nThis October, the Office of the Registrar, Residence Services, and IST announced a new admission \nand residence application process. First-year applicants can now apply for both admission and \nresidence on a single form, pay both application fees simultaneously, and accept both offers \nthrough Bear Tracks.  \nThe streamlined residence and admission process could be a determining factor for out-of-\nprovince students, and will better support out Undergraduate National Recruitment Strategy. \nUAlberta.ca Pilot Project \nYou may have noticed some recent changes to ualberta.ca. Over the past several months, the \nUniversity Relations digital team has evaluated engagement with our site—how users view it, \nwhere they click, what type of content they search for, and what content they are drawn to. The new \ndesign will help generate interest in the university from both internal and external audiences, as \nwell as better support strategic initiatives like student recruitment.  \nThe University Relations digital team is piloting its new design through the end of November. \nhttps://blog.ualberta.ca/more-than-a-doodle-a-look-at-the-ualberta-ca-pilot-project-f02d6b29c24a\n3 \nOFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT  \n2-24 South Academic Building (SAB)  |  Edmonton, Alberta, Canada T6G 2G7  |  president.ualberta.ca \nNew PhD in Indigenous Studies Program  \nFive students have started into the PhD in Indigenous Studies program, offered through the Faculty \nof Native Studies. The compressed doctoral program, completed over three years, aims to move \nstudents into careers more quickly. The PhD in Indigenous Studies represents an important \nexpansion for both the Faculty of Native Studies and the Indigenous studies discipline.  \nExperiential Learning Environmental Scan \nThis October, you may have received an experiential learning survey from the Office of the Provost \nand the Centre for Teaching and Learning. The survey is part of a joint initiative to review current \nexperiential learning opportunities at the U of A, and ultimately increase students' participation in a \nbroad range of experiential learning opportunities. Alongside the survey, the two offices completed \nseveral interviews, a literature review, and an environmental scan of the U15 universities. \nA Council on Experiential Learning, with representation from across the academy (including \nundergraduate and graduate students), is convening to support experiential learning development \nat the University of Alberta moving forward. We are currently establishing terms of reference for \nthe council, and this month’s GFC agenda includes an early consultation on the above initiatives. \nKEY TALKING POINT:  \nAs a research university, we offer a wealth of transformative learning \nexperiences. We strive to inspire our students, nurture their talents, \nand enable their success both within the university and beyond it.   \nTeaching Practices and Supports Survey \nIn addition to the experiential learning initiative above, the Centre for Teaching and Learning (CTL) \nis reviewing current teaching practices across our campuses. You may have received the CTL’s \nsurvey by email earlier in November—you can also find the survey here.  \nThe survey focuses on creativity and innovation in teaching, and explores:  \n• Teaching practices already in use across our campuses \n• Changes instructors would like to make in their teaching \n• Supports that instructors have and/or need to make such changes \nThe results will be disseminated across the university, and will help the CTL to develop relevant \nand responsive programming and resources. \nhttps://blog.ualberta.ca/tell-us-about-your-teaching-survey-6f3a7381deb9\nhttps://www.surveymonkey.com/r/UACTL\n4 \nOFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT  \n2-24 South Academic Building (SAB)  |  Edmonton, Alberta, Canada T6G 2G7  |  president.ualberta.ca \nAcademic Excellence \nThe U of A’s students, faculty and staff continue to excel across disciplines and at the highest \nlevels. I recently attended the following celebrations: \n2017 Killam Laureates \nThis year, we celebrated the 50th anniversary of the Killam program. The Killam endowments have \ngenerated more than $116 million in funding for the U of A alone, and continue to support research \nand scholarship at the highest levels.  \nThe U of A’s 24 Killam Laureates for 2017 represent a variety of disciplines, including: education, \narts, science, business, medicine and health sciences, engineering, and agricultural and \nenvironmental sciences. All four Killam trustees joined us at North Campus on October 18 to \nrecognize the new laureates. \nTEC Edmonton Innovation Awards \nTEC Edmonton’s 2017 Innovation Awards were hosted on North Campus on November 16. The \nawards celebrate knowledge translation and recognize U of A researchers who have successfully \nreceived a U.S. patent or created a spin-off company.  \nAt the 2017 Awards, we celebrated:  \n• 25 U of A researchers who received U.S. patents \n• 29 total patents for U of A researchers  \n• 4 new spin-off companies \nKEY TALKING POINT:  \nThe U of A is a public university. To serve the public good, our leading \nresearch needs to inspire innovative technologies, launch new \nbusinesses, inform evidence-based policy, drive cleaner energy \npractices, and build healthier communities.  \nCFI Infrastructure Funding \nOn October 12, the federal government announced $18.9 million in infrastructure funding from the \nCanadian Foundation for Innovation for six U of A research projects. The research projects span \nscience, engineering, and medicine and the health sciences. \nhttps://blog.ualberta.ca/community-congrats-october-19-2017-657d2ab12e95\nhttp://www.folio.ca/new-round-of-federal-infrastructure-funding-to-help-nanotechnology-go-beyond-the-lab/\n5 \nOFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT  \n2-24 South Academic Building (SAB)  |  Edmonton, Alberta, Canada T6G 2G7  |  president.ualberta.ca \nNaylor Report Advocacy \nIn cooperation with Universities Canada and the U15, we are continuing to advocate for the Naylor \nReport recommendations. To this end, I participated in a series of advocacy meetings with \nUniversities Canada on Parliament Hill at the end of October. I also recently co-authored two op-\neds—the first with Marina Banister, and the second with Elizabeth Cannon and Mike Mahon.  \nI will continue to personally engage in several communications and advocacy initiatives over the \ncoming months. I invite you to also share broadly the value and benefits of basic research.  \nHelmholtz Delegation Visit \nIn late September, the U of A hosted a delegation from the Helmholtz Association of Research \nInstitutes. The Helmholtz-Alberta Initiative has been a key partnership, engaging 273 U of A \nresearchers and 63 total graduate students on 46 distinct projects. The partnership also played an \nimportant role in establishing the $75 million Future Energy Systems research initiative. The \ndelegation visit provided an opportunity to deepen and extend Helmholtz-Alberta collaboration.  \nU of A’s United Way Campaign \nDuring the U of A’s 2017 campaign, which ran from October 11-27, our community raised more \nthan $470,000 for the United Way. Thank you for your generous contributions.  \nEach year, many donations come in during November and December, after the campaign period. If \nyou have not yet made a donation, it is not too late—please consider giving to the United Way. \nEngaging Alumni \nMeeting of Indigenous Alumni \nFrom October 18-20, the U of A hosted a gathering of Indigenous alumni, which brought 24 former \nstudents back to campus. Over the three days, the group began preliminary discussions on \ndeveloping a council of Indigenous alumni to advise the university as we work towards \nreconciliation. The alumni are meeting to continue the discussion this December.  \nGovernors Emeriti Luncheon \nAt the end of October, we hosted the inaugural meeting of the Board Governors Emeritus Members \n(GEM) on North Campus. GEM aims to keep members engaged with the university after they retire \nfrom the board, so they can be ambassadors and advocates for the University of Alberta. \nhttp://www.sciencereview.ca/eic/site/059.nsf/eng/home\nhttp://www.sciencereview.ca/eic/site/059.nsf/eng/home\nhttps://beta.theglobeandmail.com/opinion/excellence-in-research-undergrad-education-can-co-exist/article36836425/?ref=http://www.theglobeandmail.com&\nhttp://edmontonjournal.com/opinion/columnists/opinion-investing-in-pure-research-is-unpredictable-but-essential\nhttps://www.ualberta.ca/united-way\nhttps://www.ualberta.ca/united-way\n6 \nOFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT  \n2-24 South Academic Building (SAB)  |  Edmonton, Alberta, Canada T6G 2G7  |  president.ualberta.ca \nObjective 22: Financial Sustainability Initiatives \nTo achieve the ambitious aspirations to advance teaching, learning, and research outlined in For \nthe Public Good, the University of Alberta must stand on a strong financial and operational \nfoundation.  \nAs we committed in Objective 22, we are now in the process of addressing some key financial \nissues and developing the financial planning tools and processes we need to use our resources to \nmaximum effect and build the capacity to invest in our priorities.  \nThese were the subject of two recent posts on The Quad, as well as a campus forum.  \nMany initiatives are in play with related but different outcomes: \n1. Eliminate a structural deficit in the operating budget, and reduce our reliance on \ninvestment income to support ongoing base expenditures. \n2. Implement a new multi-year budget planning and accountability process to enhance \nthe ability of the university, faculties, and administrative units to plan for the future. \n3. Develop tools, including a UAlberta-specific budget model, which will help to ensure \neffective alignment between core academic activities and the allocation of resources \nand put us in position to achieve our strategic priorities. \nSuccessful implementation of these initiatives will ideally lead to the following benefits: \n• Alignment of our strategic academic activities and priorities with the allocation of resources \n• Long-term financial sustainability \n• Transparency and simplicity to budgeting and strategic planning processes \n• Predictable and equitable distribution of resources and costs \n• More effective and sustainable use of resources \nFor more information, I encourage you to explore our Financial Sustainability webpages.  \nThank you for your continued dedication to the University of Alberta. \nYours sincerely, \nDavid H.

Post-Secondary Learning Act (PSLA): The PSLA gives GFC \nresponsibility, subject to the authority of the Board of Governors, over \nacademic affairs (Section 26(1)). Further, the PSLA gives the Board of \nGovernors authority over certain admission requirements and rules \nrespecting enrolment (Section 60(1)(c) and (d)). The Board has \ndelegated its authority over admissions requirements and rules \nrespecting enrolment to GFC. GFC has thus established an Academic \nStandards Committee (ASC). \n2. PSLA: The PSLA gives Faculty Councils power to “provide for the \nadmission of students to the faculty” (29(1)(c)). \n3. UAPPOL Admissions Policy: “Admission to the University of Alberta is \nbased on documented academic criteria established by individual \nFaculties and approved by GFC. This criteria may be defined in areas \nsuch as subject requirements, minimum entrance averages, and \nlanguage proficiency requirements. In addition to academic requirements \nfor admission, GFC authorizes each Faculty to establish such other \nreasonable criteria for admission of applicants as the Faculty may \nconsider appropriate to its programs of study, subject to the approval of \nGFC (e.g. interview, audition, portfolio, etc.) \nThe admission requirements for any Faculty will be those approved by \nGFC as set forth in the current edition of the University Calendar. In \naddition to the admission requirements, selection criteria for quota \nprograms, where they exist, will also be published in the current edition \nof the University Calendar. The responsibility for admission decisions will \nbe vested in the Faculty Admission Committees or in the Deans of the \nrespective Faculties, as the councils of such Faculties will determine.” \n2. UAPPOL Admissions Procedure: \n“PROCEDURE \n1. EFFECTIVE DATE OF CHANGES TO ADMISSION REGULATIONS \nFollowing approval by GFC: \na. Where changes to admission regulations may disadvantage students \nin the current admission cycle, normally implementation will be \neffective after the change has been published in the University \nCalendar for one full year (i.e., effective the second year that the \ninformation is published in the University Calendar). \nFor example, a change approved in May 2005 would be first published in \nthe 2006-2007 University Calendar in March 2006. Therefore the \nstatement cannot come into effect until September 2007 (affecting \napplicants who apply for the September 2007 term beginning July 2006). \nb. Where changes to admission regulations are deemed by the \napproving body to be ‘advantageous to students’, normally the date of \nimplementation will be effective immediately or at the next available \nintake for the admitting Faculty.” \n3.

Calendar change request \nPrepared by: Janice Hurlburt, Graduate Governance and Policy Coordinator, jhurlbur@ualberta.ca \n 1 \nAlberta School of Business \nRationale for Mandarin Language Delivery \nBusiness schools in today’s global environment face two challenges. The first is \ninternationalization of their curricula and the other is globalization of its brand and \nreputation. Both of these challenges entail engagement in international activities to \nenable student acquisition of international experience and exposure through global \npartnerships.  Like other faculties, business schools must be mindful of international \ndevelopments and how they may impact on our curriculum, reputational and \nrecruitment efforts. There is however one development that affects business schools \nmost immediately.  \nBusiness schools are vulnerable to certain global education trends because of the \nnature of business education. Economic growth and development usually augments \nthe demand for business education in an exponentially fashion. The rapid growth in \nthe Middle East and Asia have led to increased demand for MBA and other business \nrelated master programs and made them popular degrees for overseas delivery by \nWestern universities. Consequently, overseas degree delivery, either stand-alone or \njoint programs with local institutions, has become a popular vehicle for Western \nbusiness to cultivate a global reputation, compete for quality students and create \nadditional revenues in recent years. This trend has led to the emergence of \neducation hubs in the Middle East and Asia where foreign and local universities \nhave set up branch campuses as an alternative to programs offered in the West. \nToday, China is the largest host country to foreign branch campuses1 and has joined \nIndia and South Korea, along with many Western universities, in establishing branch \ncampuses abroad2. Indeed, China and Japan have begun to compete for international \nstudents with regional education HUBs such as Dubai, Malaysia, and Singapore in \nrecent years3. One of China’s strategies is to utilize foreign programs in China to \nattract international students who may be averse to enrolling in a domestic Chinese \ninstitution. \nDevelopments in China are of particular interest to the Alberta School of Business as \nit has been an important driver of our international initiatives since 1984. China is \nnot only the largest source of international students for the University of Alberta; it \n1 SI News, China is now home to the most international branch campuses in the world – report, Nov \n2016, https://www.studyinternational.com/news/china-is-now-home-to-the-most-international-\nbranch-campuses-in-the-world-report/ \n2 http://monitor.icef.com/2014/09/oecd-releases-detailed-study-global-education-trends-2014/ \n3 SI News, South Korea: Gov’t promotes overseas expansion in higher education, April 12, 2016; \nhttp://studyinternational.com/news/south-korea-govt-promotes-overseas-expansion-in-higher-\neducation/ \nhttps://www.studyinternational.com/news/china-is-now-home-to-the-most-international-branch-campuses-in-the-world-report/\nhttps://www.studyinternational.com/news/china-is-now-home-to-the-most-international-branch-campuses-in-the-world-report/\n 2 \nis also a crucial new source of trade and investment for Alberta. The rising economic \ninfluence of China and the growing demand for Western education by Chinese \nstudents have made China a central strategic consideration for any globally minded \nbusiness schools. \nThe School’s decision to offer the Master of Financial Management (MFM) in China \nwas driven by our desire to create a global brand, internationalize the School \nculture, globalize the learning experience for our Canadian students (through study \ntours and in-country delivery of regular program classes in China), and to create an \nextra revenue stream. China is an indispensable element of the School’s \ninternationalization strategy.  \nHowever, in order to capitalize on the growing reputation the MFM program has \ncreated for the School and to create long-term viability through economies of scale, \nan expansion of program activities is called for. Efficiency in operations, student \nrecruitment and curriculum development requires certain critical mass that does \nnot currently exist. Market research suggests that Mandarin language delivery of the \nMFM or an MBA program would allow the School to penetrate a very large market of \nsenior executives or managers who are outside of our existing target market \nbecause of the English language requirement. In addition, by teaching courses in the \nnative language we believe that learning outcomes will be enhanced.  Inclusion of \nthis market segment would allow the School to also expand its external and alumni \ndevelopment activities in China over time.  \nAll programs in the Alberta School of Business are subject to both our external \naccreditation (AACSB) as well as internal quality assurance processes.  Our last \nAACSB report (2015) gave our programs high marks in ensuring quality program \ndelivery.  The new programs in China will also be subject to these same reviews. \nThe Alberta School of Business consulted with Brent Epperson, Graduate \nOmbudsperson regarding the procedures for academic misconduct. The existing \ncode of student behaviour will be translated into Mandarin. \nIn summary, the benefits of Mandarin delivery of the MFM and MBA programs in \nChina would create the following benefits to the School and the University:  \n• Long-term economic viability of MFM (China) program; \n• Enhanced global reach and branding of the School;  \n• Greater effectiveness in attracting quality international students;  \n• Enhanced learning experience for students in their native language;  \n• Internationalization of School culture and student experience; \n• Additional revenue source in a fiscally challenged environment;  \n• Internationalization and expansion of alumni network; and \n• Increased potential for external development.  \nKillam Centre for Advanced Studies \n2-29 Triffo Hall Edmonton AB Canada  T6G 2E1 \nTel: 780.492.2816 / Fax: 780.492.0692 \nwww.gradstudies.ualberta.ca  \n1 \nFACULTY OF GRADUATE STUDIES AND RESEARCH \nMarch 30, 2017 \n2018-2019 University of Alberta Proposed Calendar Graduate Program Changes: Alberta School of \nBusiness admission requirement change to waive ELP for programs taught in Chinese in China (and \naddition of Master of Accounting). \nCurrent Proposed  \nGraduate Programs \nBusiness [Graduate] \nGeneral Information \n[…] \nEntrance Requirements \nThe minimum admission requirements of the Faculty of \nBusiness are those of the Faculty of Graduate Studies and \nResearch; namely, an undergraduate degree with an \naverage of at least 3.0 in the last two years of \nundergraduate work (or graduate work) at the University \nof Alberta, or an equivalent qualification from a \nrecognized institution. \nAll applicants are required to write the Graduate \nManagement Admission Test, and have their scores \nforwarded to the appropriate individual (i.e., Associate \nDean – MBA Programs; or the Director – PhD Program; \nFaculty of Business).

​RESIDENCE​ ​DISCIPLINE​ ​STATISTICS​ ​2016-2017 \nSubmitted​ ​to​ ​the​ ​Campus​ ​Law​ ​Review​ ​Committee,​ ​September​ ​15th,​ ​2017.  \nIn​ ​accordance​ ​with​ ​the​ ​Campus​ ​Law​ ​Review​ ​Committee​ ​Terms​ ​of​ ​Reference​ ​the​ ​following \nResidence​ ​Discipline​ ​Report​ ​summarizes​ ​the​ ​period​ ​of​ ​May​ ​1st,​ ​2016​ ​to​ ​August​ ​31st,​ ​2017.  \nResidence​ ​Services​ ​has​ ​been​ ​utilizing​ ​Restorative​ ​Justice​ ​for​ ​six​ ​years​ ​now.​ ​We​ ​continue​ ​to​ ​see \nrestorative​ ​solutions​ ​being​ ​used​ ​as​ ​the​ ​primary​ ​mechanism​ ​for​ ​addressing​ ​student​ ​conduct​ ​in​ ​our \nresidence​ ​system.​ ​Anecdotally,​ ​our​ ​staff​ ​have​ ​also​ ​reported​ ​that​ ​student​ ​acceptance​ ​and​ ​usage​ ​of \nrestorative​ ​language​ ​and​ ​acceptance​ ​of​ ​the​ ​concept​ ​of​ ​Restorative​ ​Justice​ ​appears​ ​to​ ​be \nimproving​ ​as​ ​well.  \nDespite​ ​the​ ​successes​ ​we​ ​are​ ​seeing,​ ​we​ ​still​ ​face​ ​challenges.​ ​Last​ ​year​ ​we​ ​reported​ ​that​ ​we \nbegan​ ​utilizing​ ​Restorative​ ​Justice​ ​when​ ​dealing​ ​with​ ​Operations​ ​related​ ​issues.​ ​Such​ ​issues \ninclude:​ ​unauthorized​ ​tenants​ ​(subletting),​ ​cleanliness,​ ​and​ ​response​ ​to​ ​pest​ ​treatments.​ ​​ ​This \nprocess​ ​is​ ​continuing​ ​to​ ​develop​ ​and​ ​further​ ​training​ ​will​ ​be​ ​necessary​ ​within​ ​those​ ​units​ ​to \nensure​ ​consistent​ ​application​ ​of​ ​Restorative​ ​Justice​ ​and​ ​restorative​ ​principles.​ ​We​ ​also​ ​look​ ​to \ncontinue​ ​to​ ​build​ ​capacity​ ​with​ ​our​ ​Residence​ ​Life​ ​professional​ ​staff,​ ​having​ ​lost​ ​many​ ​of​ ​our \nstaff​ ​with​ ​significant​ ​experience​ ​in​ ​facilitating​ ​Restorative​ ​Justice​ ​in​ ​recent​ ​years.  \nAs​ ​was​ ​reported​ ​last​ ​year,​ ​our​ ​Housing​ ​Management​ ​System​ ​software​ ​ceased​ ​support​ ​of​ ​​ ​the \njudicial​ ​module​ ​in​ ​July​ ​of​ ​2016.​ ​Data​ ​becomes​ ​increasingly​ ​difficult​ ​to​ ​scrub​ ​and​ ​though​ ​we​ ​do \nnot​ ​feel​ ​that​ ​the​ ​validity​ ​of​ ​our​ ​numbers​ ​is​ ​any​ ​less​ ​reliable,​ ​the​ ​need​ ​for​ ​a​ ​new​ ​system​ ​has \nbecome​ ​increasingly​ ​evident.​ ​When​ ​combing​ ​through​ ​this​ ​year’s​ ​numbers,​ ​we​ ​realized​ ​a​ ​glitch​ ​in \nthe​ ​calculation​ ​of​ ​last​ ​year’s​ ​statistics,​ ​as​ ​the​ ​default​ ​reporting​ ​causes​ ​some​ ​incidents​ ​to​ ​be \nreported​ ​twice.​ ​When​ ​we​ ​scrubbed​ ​the​ ​data​ ​this​ ​year​ ​we​ ​sought​ ​to​ ​remove​ ​these​ ​duplicates.​ ​It​ ​is \nunclear​ ​whether​ ​the​ ​duplicates​ ​from​ ​last​ ​year​ ​were​ ​material​ ​in​ ​the​ ​overall​ ​reporting.​ ​However,​ ​we \nfelt​ ​it​ ​important​ ​to​ ​bring​ ​to​ ​this​ ​group​ ​now​ ​that​ ​we’ve​ ​identified​ ​this​ ​software​ ​glitch. \nWe​ ​continue​ ​to​ ​track​ ​our​ ​judicial​ ​statistics​ ​using​ ​two​ ​criteria:​ ​violations,​ ​and​ ​sanctions.​ ​This \nallows​ ​us​ ​to​ ​more​ ​accurately​ ​reflect​ ​restorative​ ​principles​ ​in​ ​our​ ​judicial​ ​statistics.​ ​A​ ​key​ ​factor \nof​ ​Restorative​ ​Justice​ ​is​ ​that​ ​it​ ​does​ ​not​ ​focus​ ​on​ ​a​ ​‘rule’​ ​that​ ​was​ ​broken;​ ​instead​ ​it​ ​focuses​ ​on \nthe​ ​harms​ ​that​ ​come​ ​from​ ​a​ ​person’s​ ​actions.​ ​Accordingly,​ ​violations​ ​are​ ​based​ ​on​ ​the​ ​behaviour \nof​ ​the​ ​student​ ​that​ ​causes​ ​harm.​ ​Sanctions​ ​are​ ​the​ ​results​ ​of​ ​those​ ​violations.​ ​In​ ​many​ ​cases,​ ​a \nsingle​ ​restorative​ ​sanction​ ​can​ ​address​ ​the​ ​harms​ ​of​ ​several​ ​violations​ ​(for​ ​example,​ ​an​ ​apology \nto​ ​an​ ​entire​ ​community​ ​may​ ​be​ ​sufficient​ ​to​ ​address​ ​multiple​ ​harms​ ​caused).  \nIn​ ​2016/2017,​ ​we​ ​had​ ​1,445​ ​unique​ ​incidents.​ ​This​ ​represents​ ​a​ ​35%​ ​increase​ ​over​ ​last​ ​year’s \nnumber​ ​(1,064​ ​unique​ ​incidents);​ ​this​ ​increase​ ​is​ ​largely​ ​due​ ​to​ ​increase​ ​in​ ​the​ ​number​ ​of \nreported​ ​incidents​ ​(Maintenance,​ ​Operations,​ ​student​ ​staff)​ ​​ ​without​ ​any​ ​follow-up.  \nFor​ ​example,​ ​maintenance​ ​incidents​ ​get​ ​reported​ ​by​ ​our​ ​staff​ ​in​ ​the​ ​Housing​ ​Management \nSystem​ ​but​ ​there​ ​is​ ​rarely​ ​any​ ​follow-up​ ​initiated​ ​from​ ​our​ ​Residence​ ​Life​ ​team.​ ​Maintenance​ ​is \ndoubly​ ​reported​ ​through​ ​another​ ​system​ ​which​ ​initiates​ ​action​ ​on​ ​their​ ​part​ ​and​ ​the​ ​reporting​ ​in \nour​ ​Housing​ ​Management​ ​System​ ​merely​ ​serves​ ​as​ ​a​ ​backstop​ ​but​ ​also​ ​as​ ​a​ ​means​ ​for \ndocumenting​ ​our​ ​staff’s​ ​involvement​ ​in​ ​the​ ​community.​ ​The​ ​number​ ​of​ ​these​ ​types​ ​of​ ​‘none \nspecified’​ ​incidents​ ​accounted​ ​for​ ​49%​ ​of​ ​the​ ​unique​ ​incidents​ ​that​ ​were​ ​reported​ ​in​ ​the​ ​last​ ​year. \nOf​ ​the​ ​remaining​ ​735​ ​incidents,​ ​517​ ​or​ ​70%​ ​utilized​ ​restorative​ ​solutions​ ​(Community \nResolutions,​ ​Alcohol​ ​Abstention,​ ​Apology​ ​Letters,​ ​Restitution,​ ​Behavioural​ ​Agreements,​ ​or \nRestorative​ ​Agreements).​ ​This​ ​is​ ​a​ ​slight​ ​reduction​ ​from​ ​last​ ​year’s​ ​figure​ ​of​ ​83%,​ ​however​ ​the \ncontinued​ ​emphasis​ ​of​ ​utilizing​ ​Restorative​ ​Justice​ ​principles​ ​for​ ​Operations​ ​related​ ​issues​ ​(ex: \ncleanliness,​ ​unauthorized​ ​tenants)​ ​logically​ ​explains​ ​this​ ​difference.  \nIn​ ​2016/2017,​ ​Lister​ ​continues​ ​to​ ​account​ ​for​ ​the​ ​majority​ ​of​ ​our​ ​conduct​ ​with​ ​726​ ​incidents​ ​or \n50.24%​ ​of​ ​our​ ​total​ ​incidents​ ​originate​ ​in​ ​Kelsey,​ ​Mackenzie,​ ​Henday,​ ​or​ ​Schäffer​ ​Hall.​ ​An \nadditional​ ​115​ ​or​ ​7.9%​ ​of​ ​incidents​ ​occurred​ ​within​ ​the​ ​Lister​ ​Centre​ ​complex,​ ​bringing​ ​the​ ​total \nLister​ ​incidents​ ​to​ ​841​ ​incidents​ ​or​ ​58%.​ ​Considering​ ​the​ ​staffing​ ​levels​ ​and​ ​the​ ​concentration​ ​of \nfirst-year​ ​students,​ ​this​ ​is​ ​understandable​ ​and​ ​is​ ​consistent​ ​with​ ​our​ ​reporting​ ​over​ ​the​ ​past \nnumber​ ​of​ ​years. \nFor​ ​the​ ​second​ ​year​ ​in​ ​a​ ​row,​ ​we​ ​collected​ ​data​ ​on​ ​the​ ​number​ ​of​ ​students​ ​of​ ​concern​ ​reported​ ​in \nresidence.​ ​Last​ ​year,​ ​in​ ​our​ ​first​ ​reporting​ ​year​ ​we​ ​identified​ ​172​ ​unique​ ​cases​ ​-​ ​this​ ​year,​ ​we \nreported​ ​161.​ ​This​ ​continues​ ​to​ ​place​ ​significant​ ​strain​ ​on​ ​internal​ ​resources​ ​as​ ​well​ ​as​ ​the​ ​need \nto​ ​draw​ ​support​ ​from​ ​campus​ ​partners.  \nCommunity Occupants  \n(as​ ​at​ ​Sept​ ​16 \n2016) \nIncidents Sanctions​ ​Issued Students​ ​of \nConcern \nAlder/Linden 39 10 0

Student Conduct and Accountability Statistical Report \nPrepared by: <Deborah Eerkes, Director, SCA, deerkes@ualberta.ca> \nSTATISTICAL REPORT\n2016/17   ACADEMIC YEAR\nwww.ualberta.ca/studentconduct     \nSTUDENT CONDUCT AND \nACCOUNTABILITY (SCA)\nMANDATE\nStudent Conduct and Accountability (SCA) is mandated to deal \nwith issues around the Code of Student Behaviour. Approaching \nthe Code in terms of awareness, prevention and student \ndiscipline, SCA strives to ensure that students understand the \nexpectations placed upon them by the Code and are able to \nparticipate freely and fully in the university community.\nWhen students are alleged to have engaged in behaviour \nthat violates the Code of Student Behaviour, one of the two \nDiscipline Officers in SCA is assigned to make a decision \naccording to the procedures set out in the Code.  Faculty \nDeans (or designate) make recommendations for severe \nsanctions in academic misconduct cases, while University of \nThe two Discipline Officers completed a total of 46 decisions \nin the 2016/17 academic year. In order to align the numbers \nwith those collected by the Appeals and Compliance Officer, \nthe decisions counted in this report include those in which the \nappeal deadline falls between July 1, 2016, and June 30, 2017. \nThe matters before the Discipline Officers are complex, often \ninvolving legal or procedural considerations. Investigations take \non average 25.25 hours to complete, although the time required \nranged from 7 hours for the simplest decision to 85 hours for \nthe most complex. The majority of the cases fell within the  \n15-30 hour range. \nMost academic violations are handled solely at the Faculty level \nwith Intermediate Sanctions under the Code. Appropriately, \nonly the most egregious cases are referred to SCA with \nrecommendations for Severe Sanctions. These cases tend to \nbe more complex in nature and often involve prior offences. \nBecause the statistics cited herein apply strictly to Student \nConduct and Accountability, any trends identified in terms of \nacademic misconduct must not be generalized to the entire \nUniversity. For a total number of academic offences that did not \ninvolve a referral to the Discipline Officer, please refer to the \nAppeals Coordinator’s report from University Governance.\nAlberta Protective Services (UAPS) or Unit Directors make \nrecommendations for charges and sanctions in non-academic \nmisconduct cases. The Discipline Officer meets with the student \nalleged to have committed the misconduct, investigates the \ncomplaint if the facts are in dispute, and makes a finding on \nwhether the student violated the Code. If the student is found \nresponsible, the Discipline Officer decides what sanctions are \nwarranted, using the recommendation from the complainant as \na starting point.\nThroughout the 2016/17 academic year, Deborah Eerkes and \nChris Hackett were the two Discipline Officers under the Code \nof Student Behaviour.\nUAPS investigates allegations of non-academic misconduct, \nand of those that fall under the Code of Student Behaviour, \nsends recommendations for charges and sanctions to the \nDiscipline Officer. In addition, Unit Directors can recommend \ncharges and sanctions to the Discipline Officer for allegations \nof Inappropriate Use of University Property and Resources \nrelating to their own units. \nFinally, the Discipline Officers are responsible to make decisions \nin two kinds of appeals: \n1. Students can appeal a UAPS Violation Notice to the \nDiscipline Officer when they are disputing the facts. The \nDiscipline Officer can uphold or deny the appeal, or vary \nthe fine on the Violation Notice. \n2. The second type of appeal relates to complaints made to \nUAPS in which the Director decides not to recommend \ncharges under the Code. The complainant can appeal to \nthe Discipline Officer, who makes a decision on whether \nit was reasonable not to lay charges under the Code, or \nwhether an investigation should proceed. In the latter case, \nthe Discipline Officer will initiate an investigation, make a \nfinding and render a decision. This is a change to procedure \nin the Code of Student Behaviour that took effect in \nSeptember 2015, and significantly simplifies the process.\nDISCIPLINE CASES\n2\nThe 46 case files for the 2016/17 academic year showed a \nsignificant decrease from the previous year. 1 of those cases was \na student appeal, and did not involve charges against a student. \nThe complexity and seriousness of the offences is reflected in \nthe sanctions imposed in the remaining 45 cases, including 5 \nTRENDS\nexpulsions, 3 exclusions, 14 suspensions, 28 orders of conduct \nprobation, 1 suspension of services, 1 order of restitution \nand one case in which no additional sanctions were imposed. \nCharges were dismissed in 5 cases.  \nDisposition\n2016/17 Sanctions\nConduct Probation  53%\nExpulsion  9%\nExclusion 6%\nSuspend Services  2%\nRestitution  2%\nNo Add’l sanction  2%\nSuspension  26%\nFig. 1  Disposition of Decisions of the Discipline Officer\n3\nFig. 2  Severe Sanctions - 3 year comparison\nSuspension\nExpulsion\n0\n12\n6\n18\n3\n15\n24\n27\n30\n9\n21\n2014/15 2015/16\nN\nu\nm\nb\ner\n o\nf S\nan\nct\nio\nn\ns\n2016/17\n18\n29\n3\n14\n55\nFig. 3  Disposition of Decisions of the Discipline Officer – 3 year comparison\nNote: Some cases result in multiple sanctions, therefore the total number of sanctions imposed (58) is greater than the number of cases (45).\n* In addition to any sanctions imposed by Dean or Unit Director\nDISCIPLINE OFFICER SANCTION*\nNUMBER IMPOSED\n2014/15 2015/16 2016/17\nExpulsion 5 3 5\nSuspension 18 29 14\nConduct Probation 27 45 28\nFine 2 3 0\nExclusion 7 9 3\nSuspension University Resources 0 0 1\nRestitution 2 2 1\nReprimand 0 0 0\nCharges upheld; no additional sanctions 0 0 1\nCharges dismissed; no sanction 4 3 5\nTotal Sanctions 65 94 58\nCOMPLAINANT \nNUMBER OF CASES COMPLETED\n2014/15 2015/16 2016/17\nACADEMIC\nAgricultural, Life and Environmental Sciences 2 0 1\nArts 6 10 8\nAugustana 0 2 0\nBusiness 1 6 1\nEngineering 1 1 1\nExtension 2 2 0\nFaculty of Graduate Studies and Research 3 1 3\nNursing 0 0 1\nPharmacy 0 0 1\nScience 3 1 3\nNON-\nACADEMIC\nUniversity of Alberta Protective Services 25 35 26\nStudent - Appeal of Violation Notice 0 1 0\nStudent - Appeal of UAPS decision not to proceed N/A 2 1\nFaculties submitted 19 of our 46 files in which students were \ncharged with academic offences, while roughly 60% came \nOf the 45 cases involving charges, 1 was appealed to the University Appeal Board (UAB), and that appeal was denied.\nfrom University of Alberta Protective Services (non-academic \nmisconduct).

The remaining \n5 violations were deemed sufficiently serious to warrant a \nsevere sanction for a first offence. \nAs is often the case, gender plays a role in non-academic \noffences: 25 out of 26 students who committed non-academic \noffences were male, 1 was female. Academic offences were \nroughly evenly split between the genders.  \nGender\nMALE FEMALE\n2014/15\nAcademic 13 6\nNon-Academic 20 5\n2015/16\nAcademic 13 10\nNon-Academic 22 13\n2016/17\nAcademic 10 9\nNon-Academic 25 1\nFig. 5  Case by Type and Gender (excluding student appeals)\nOf the 18 charges of Violation of Safety or Dignity, 13 involved \ngender-based violence. The nature of the conduct included \nsexual harassment, threats of violence, creating a condition that \nthreatens the safety or wellbeing of others, and sexual assault. \nIt must be understood that this number refers to only complaints \nmade under the Code of Student Behaviour to University of \nAlberta Protective Services, which are investigated and \nforwarded to the Discipline Officer with recommendations for \ncharges and sanctions.

Some statistics for previous years are also included \nfor comparison. \nThis report sets out information about discipline decisions and the appeal process under the Code of Student \nBehaviour (COSB) and the Code of Applicant Behaviour (COAB), with a focus on the university appeal level of the \nUniversity Appeal Board (UAB). This report also sets out information for the two other university level appeal \nbodies, the General Faculties Council Academic Appeals Committee (GFC AAC) and the General Faculties Council \nPractice Review Board (GFC PRB). \nRole of the Appeals Coordinator \nAs Appeals and Compliance Officer, I carry out the role of the Appeals Coordinator under the COSB, COAB, \nUniversity of Alberta Academic Appeals Policy and University of Alberta Practicum Intervention Policy for the \nUAB, GFC AAC and GFC PRB. In this role I am neutral and do not advocate for either party in an appeal. I \nfacilitate or administer the appeal process steps from the time an appeal is received, through the hearing and decision \nmade by an appeal panel, to distribution of the written decision. I also provide procedural information to the parties \nto an appeal and to the appeal panel throughout the appeal process. \nApart from individual appeals, I oversee the university level appeal system to ensure that the university continues to \nimplement a fair process by which to address appeals. This includes helping to educate panel members as to the \nframework within which they work when hearing appeals and helping the university community understand that \nframework.  \nUniversity Level Appeal Process \nThe university level appeal system is made up of three appeal bodies – the UAB, the GFC AAC and the GFC PRB. \nDiscipline decisions arise as a result of a student being charged with an offence (academic and/or non-academic) \nunder the COSB or COAB. When the appropriate decision-maker has made a final decision finding an offence and \nimposing a sanction, the parties to that decision have a final appeal to the UAB. \nPage 1 of 4\nAttachment 1.0 \nThe UAB generally hears appeals from students charged under the COSB or COAB who disagree with the discipline \ndecisions. UAB decisions are final and binding, within the university, subject to judicial review. Under the COSB \nthe UAB has the broad authority to determine whether an offence was committed and to confirm, vary or quash \nsanctions imposed. \nUnder the Academic Appeals Policy, academic standing issues are heard by the GFC AAC. The GFC AAC hears \nappeals from students wishing to appeal faculty decisions on matters of academic standing, including matters such \nas a requirement to withdraw, denial of graduation or promotion. The GFC AAC hears appeals from students after \nthey have exhausted all other avenues of appeal within a faculty. GFC AAC decisions are final and binding, within \nthe university, subject to judicial review. The authority of the GFC AAC is to uphold (and award any remedy not \ncontrary to faculty rules) or deny an appeal depending upon whether a miscarriage of justice, as defined by the \nAcademic Appeals Policy, occurred within the faculty process.  \nUnder the Practicum Intervention Policy, appeals concerning practicum interventions are heard by the GFC PRB. \nThe GFC PRB’s decisions are final and binding, within the university, subject to judicial review. \nPrinciples of the Appeal Process \nAppeals at the university level deal with complex issues affecting students, faculties and the university as a whole. \nGiven this impact, and the fact that this final level of appeal is the last opportunity for issues to be heard within the \nuniversity, it is very important that the appeal process is fair and perceived to be fair. Coming to decisions through a \nfair process also promotes confidence in those decisions by the parties and the appeal panels themselves. Being the \nfinal level of appeal, the decisions or process may also be subject to judicial scrutiny. \nThe authority of the appeal bodies (UAB/GFC AAC/GFC PRB) flows from the powers delegated under the Post-\nSecondary Learning Act. The appeal bodies carry out their authority as outlined in the applicable university appeal \npolicy, in keeping with the principles of administrative fairness. The principles of administrative fairness are the \nbasis for our appeals policies, help us to interpret those policies and provide the framework within which our appeal \npanels make decisions.    \nThe formal steps of our appeals process recognize the impact and finality of these decisions and ensure the \nopportunity for parties to an appeal to make their best cases and be heard. Our appeals process is not a court process, \nbut has been designed to allow for students and university decision-makers to be able to be heard by an objective \npanel coming from the university community. The system is flexible in that it is able to deal with a wide variety of \nappeals and circumstances (from students and university staff representing themselves or being helped by an advisor \nof their choosing) through consistently applying basic principles of administrative fairness. At its core, our appeals \nsystem involves the parties fully making their cases in writing and knowing the case of the other side before an \nappeal hearing takes place, then appearing at a hearing where they are able to present their arguments and \ninformation, subject to questioning, before an objective appeal panel.  (The UAB process also allows for the option \nof a paper-only or documentary review hearing, rather than an in-person hearing, when only the severity of sanction, \nPage 2 of 4\nAttachment 1.0 \nand not the offence, is being appealed.) The appeal panel then considers and weighs all of the submissions of the \nparties and comes to a decision, which it fully explains to the parties in writing. If any process issues or requests \narise before or during a hearing, the appeal panel chair (sometimes with the full appeal panel) decides how to fairly \naddress the issues, keeping in mind the relevant appeals policy and the principles of administrative fairness, \nincluding the aim of providing both parties a fair opportunity to be heard. \nCurrent Statistics \nLooking at the attached statistics, this year saw a small decrease in the number of UAB appeals but a similar overall \nnumber of appeals received at the university level compared to the previous year. Compared to the previous year, \n2016-2017 also saw a decrease in the number of discipline decisions made by Deans and Discipline Officers (381 \nthis year versus 429 the previous year), with the majority of those decisions concerning the academic offences of \nplagiarism and cheating. Although not statistically tracked, a significant number of appeals are received from \ninternational students.   \nWhile the provided statistics include general outcomes of the appeals heard, caution should be used before taking \nany trends from these outcomes. The sample size is very small and each case was decided on its own unique merits, \nwith the resulting statistics providing simply a snapshot of the outcomes for those particular cases heard and \ndecided.       \nAppeal Panel Membership \nThe university level appeal panels are made up of volunteer panel members. While the exact makeup of a panel \ndepends on the applicable appeal policy, generally the panels are a combination of undergraduate/graduate students \nand academic staff selected from the university’s appeal panel membership lists. (Membership is determined by an \napplication process and ultimately by approval of applicants by GFC.) Members serve on approximately six appeal \npanels within a calendar year, but this number varies depending on the number of appeals received and the faculties \ninvolved. Appeal panel members come from the greatest possible variety of faculties and the broadest possible \nrepresentation of the university community. For objectivity, no appeal panel member may sit on an appeal involving \na party from their faculty. Appeal hearings are scheduled throughout the academic year, including summer, mostly \nin evenings around academic schedules. Student panel members usually serve for terms of two years, while \nacademic staff panel members usually serve for terms of three years (with the possibility of serving additional \nterms).  \nIn addition to their understanding of the university environment from their experience as students (both \nundergraduate and graduate) and academic staff, our panel members are provided ongoing training in understanding \nthe principles of administrative fairness within which their tribunals operate. This helps to ensure that, as discussed \nabove, the appeal process is a fair one.     \nThe service of appeal panel members is a significant commitment, including considering and addressing procedural \nissues arising before and during hearings, conducting hearings, deliberating and drafting written reasons for  \nPage 3 of 4\nAttachment 1.0 \ndecisions. All of our panel members recognize the need to objectively hear submissions from parties to an appeal, \nanalyze and weigh evidence, then come to reasonable decisions based on that evidence. Part of my role is to ensure \nthat appeal panels have all the needed resources to perform their role. I thank all of our appeal panel members for \ntheir commitment and service to our university community. Their work is a very important contribution to fostering \nand maintaining the values of the university, for all members of our community. \nMichael Peterson \nAppeals and Compliance Officer \nUniversity Governance, University of Alberta  \nOctober 18, 2017 \nAttachments: Statistics for Discipline Decisions and the University Level Appeal Process \n[Statistics based upon year of appeal deadline.]   \nPage 4 of 4\nIndex of Attachments                            Attachment 2.0 \nINDEX OF ATTACHMENTS \nNumber of Appeals Attachment 2.1 \nFigure 1 ...................................................................................................................................................

If \nan appeal is upheld on any one issue, it is categorized as “Appeal Upheld”. To provide the most \naccurate picture, I have calculated the disposition of appeals by issue as follows: \nIssues of Appeal Appeal Upheld Appeal Denied \nOffence(s) 1 6 \nSeverity of Sanction(s) 4 6 \nPage 2 of 9\nDisposition of Appeals                          Attachment 2.2 \nFigure 3 \nGFC AAC Disposition of Appeals \nJuly 1, 2016 to June 30, 2017 \nAppeal Upheld 1 \nAppeal Denied 5 \nReturned to Faculty 0 \nTaken Back by Faculty 1 \nAppeal Withdrawn 1 \nAppeal in Progress 0 \nTotal Appeals 8 \n- “Returned to Faculty” means the GFC AAC decided at the appeal hearing to return the matter to \nthe Faculty Academic Appeals Committee for re-hearing, based upon new evidence being \nintroduced at the appeal hearing.  \n- “Taken Back by Faculty” means the student provided new information as part of the appeal and, \nbefore the GFC AAC hearing, the Faculty chose to reconsider the matter at the Faculty level.  \nFigure 4 \nGFC PRB Disposition of Appeals \nJuly 1, 2016 to June 30, 2017 \nAppeal Upheld 0 \nAppeal Denied 0 \nTotal Appeals 0 \nPage 3 of 9\nCategory of Sanction by Decision Maker Under COSB                    Attachment 2.3 \nFigure 5 \nCategory of Sanction by Decision Maker Under COSB \nJuly 1, 2016 to June 30, 2017 \nSanction Type Description Count Final Decision By \nDO dismissed charges 1 Discipline Officer \nExclusion 3 Discipline Officer \nLess Than Suspension or Expulsion 337 Dean \nLess Than Suspension or Expulsion 18 Discipline Officer \nLess Than Suspension or Expulsion 8 UAB \nNo Sanction Imposed by Dean 2 Dean \nNo Sanction Imposed by DO 1 Discipline Officer \nRescind Offer of Admission 1 Dean \nSuspension or Expulsion 18 Discipline Officer \nSuspension or Expulsion 1 UAB \nUAB dismissed charge 1 UAB \nPage 4 of 9\nCOSB and COAB Discipline Decisions               Attachment 2.4 \nFigure 6 \nCOSB Discipline Decisions\nJuly 1, 2016 to June 30, 2017 \nCharge/Offence  Description 1 2 3 4 5 GS N/A N/A \nN/A \nApplicant \nCheating 41 45 23 15 1 9 \nMisrepresentation of Facts 3 5 4 2 \nParticipation in an Offence 1 7 6 3 1 \nPlagiarism 81 71 50 19 19 8 \nInappropriate Behaviour in \nProfessional Programs 1 \nMisuse of Confidential Materials 1 1 \nResearch and Scholarship Misconduct 2 \nBreach of Rules External to the Code 1 \nDamage to Property 1 1 1 1 \nDisruption 1 3 1 1 \nDissemination of Malicious Material 1 2 \nUnauthorized Use of Facilities, \nEquipment, Materials, Services or \nResources \n1 2 1 \nViolations of Safety or Dignity 3 4 2 4 2 4 \n- Columns 1 through 5 refer to year of program of student when offence occurred. \n- GS N/A refers to graduate student not applicable (i.e. no program year). \n- N/A students are students in Open Studies, Faculty of Extension, Visiting Students, Previous Students and Special Students. \n- N/A applicant refers to students reapplying who have been charged with offence re application;
