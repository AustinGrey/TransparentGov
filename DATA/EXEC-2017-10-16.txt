He spoke about the potential for the PLLC to be used as an umbrella to capture other leadership activities happening at the university such as the Global Academic Leadership Development Program, Executive Education, faculty and staff professional development activities. He noted that, as the term of the current principal, the Honorable Kim Campbell, will end in June 2018 and provincial funding for this initiative will expire in 2025, it is timely to look at the PLLC’s mandate, direction, sustainability, and use this to inform the future direction of PLLC and the characteristics needed in a new principal. Dr Turpin noted that a small working group would be established to provide some strategic ideas and that feedback from campus stakeholders including deans and GFC would be sought. He reported that the Academic Planning Committee had a good discussion on this item at its meeting last week. During the discussion, members discussed the advantages of creating synergies across the university through collaboration, the use of common resources, and the sustainability of PLLC. The committee provided advice on asking GFC to provide strategic advice and potential outcomes for PLLC.",

Report to the University of Alberta President and Provost on the Peter Lougheed Leadership College by \nPeter MacKinnon \n2. Synthesis of Recommendations and Comments in Peter MacKinnon’s Report on The Peter Lougheed \nLeadership College (PLLC) by Martin Ferguson-Pell \nPrepared by: Kathleen Brough, Senior Administrative Officer, Office of the Provost and Vice-President \n(Academic) \n2\nReport to the University of Alberta President and Provost \non the Peter Lougheed Leadership College \nby Peter MacKinnon \nFebruary 2017 \n1 \nOn November 2, 3 and 4, 2016 I was on site at the University of Alberta for interviews and \ndiscussions in support of my review of the Peter Lougheed Leadership College under terms of \nreference that required me to assess (1) The strengths, weaknesses, challenges and \nopportunities of PLLC; (2) the merits of the academic and co-curricular programming offered by \nPLLC and the audience for this programming; and (3) PLLC's sustainability in three key areas: \nleadership, governance and finances. I participated in 25 meetings involving 67 participants, \nand received telephone and email submissions from others. \nI am grateful to all who met with me, or otherwise expressed their views. I must add my \ngratitude to Bobbi Schiestel of the president's office. She compiled background documents and \ninformation, coordinated an intensive interview schedule, and provided excellent support that \nmade the most of my time on campus. I thank her warmly. \nThe terms of reference shall be addressed in order. \nThe strengths, weaknesses, challenges and opportunities of PLLC \nStrengths \nThe interviews and supporting documents point to three strengths: a compelling vision with \nexisting and potentially further alignment with the University of Alberta Strategic Plan for 2016-\n2021; considerable progress in implementing the vision, and a commitment and esprit de corps \nwithin the college that is palpable. \nThe original vision is that of John and the late Bunny Ferguson who, on the death of Peter \nLougheed, sought to commemorate his legacy at their university. It rests on recognition that \nleadership is fundamentally important; that it can be learned, and that there is a discrete field of \nstudy and experience to support that learning. The Fergusons developed and carried their vision \nto public and private sector leadership in the university, province and beyond, and secured early \nand considerable financial support for its implementation. It finds contemporary expression in \nthe college's vision to serve as \"a thriving centre of excellence for leadership skills development \nwhere students are immersed in and benefit from leading-edge learning experiences.\" \nThe 2016-2021 University of Alberta Strategic Plan, For the Public Good, makes explicit \nreference to the objective of accessing \"leadership development programs for undergraduate \nand graduate students, such as the Peter Lougheed Leadership College.\" In addition, there are \ncountless references to leadership in the plan. These imply that there is an opportunity for the \nuniversity to reflect on the role that the systematic and interdisciplinary study of leadership may \nplay in the next stage of the university's evolution. As the university builds its portfolio of \n3\n2 \nsignature areas, perhaps leadership will be included among them. In its objective to attract \noutstanding students in Alberta, across Canada, and beyond, a unique and distinguished \ncapacity in leadership education and development might assist the university in recruiting the \nexceptional students it seeks to attract. Existing university capacity in French language \ninstruction and scholarship (Campus Saint-Jean) suggests potential opportunities to recruit \nstudents from French speaking regions in Canada and abroad. \nThere has been considerable progress in translating the PLLC vision into reality. \nComplementary first year courses are in place, as are second year courses devoted to \nworkshops and capstone projects. Co-curricular leadership projects and an ambitious instruction \ndevelopment model are evolving. And Peter Lougheed Hall, anticipated to be a residence and \nimportant college meeting and social centre will be open to students in September 2017. \nThe third strength is the evident commitment and esprit de corps within the college. The \nleadership is passionate about the program and potential; teaching fellows shared their passion; \nthe mentorship program is developing as planned; and, it must be emphasized, students are \nenthusiastic about the quality of their experience. Within a short time, and despite inevitable \ngrowing pains, the Peter Lougheed Leadership College has inspired enthusiastic commitment \namong its members that is notable in an organization so young. \nWeaknesses and Challenges \nFirst and most important, the college has both a short term and long term sustainability problem. \nFinancial commitments on a scale contemplated at its inception have not been confirmed. It was \nhoped that $105 million, one-third from the provincial government matched by the federal \ngovernment, with the remaining third from philanthropy, would be raised to support the initiative \nat each of the U of A and Banff Centre. This would have resulted in a pool of $210 million which \n- if endowed - could have supported the initiative in perpetuity. The reality is that only the \nprovincial commitment has been realized. A matching federal grant and philanthropic support at \nthe level anticipated are not in sight. This means that the provincial grant is not part of a larger \ninvestment fund to support the College in perpetuity. Instead it is being spent to pay for \noperations and for the capital costs of the building. \nWhat does this mean? First, provincial grant monies are being spent at a rate that could see \nthem exhausted before the expiry of the current ten year commitment. Second, upon the expiry \nof the provincial grant, continuing operations are in jeopardy unless new sources of revenue are \nconfirmed from within the university's operating budget or from external sources. Quite simply, \nas seen from 2016, the college is not sustainable. \nAnother challenge is the building that is expected to be its home: Peter Lougheed Hall. The \nuniversity will take delivery of the completed building early in 2017 and will welcome residence \nstudents the following September. The dream here is of a residential college of which there are \nmany examples worldwide. A notable Canadian example is Massey College at the University of \nToronto. \n4\n3 \nNorthrop Frye once observed that most of what we learn, we learn from one another. Peter \nLougheed Hall is intended to be more than a place to live while studying down the street or \nacross campus. It is was intended to be an interdisciplinary, intellectual community of the \ncollege's students living in proximity to one another with opportunities for informal dialogue and \nprogramming to enhance their study. This intention may not be realized. Without substantial \ninducements, it is unlikely that the hall's 143 spaces - or even half that number - will be \noccupied by PLLC students. A premium will be added to normal residence fees to reflect the \nquality of the space and the anticipated enhanced experience. The students are in their third \nand fourth years, a time at which many students prefer to live off campus. And the Edmonton \nhousing market has softened, for the foreseeable future at least, making off campus costs more \nfavourable in comparison to those of living in residence. \nA third weakness or challenge is what might be called a lack of equity in the college on the part \nof the wider University of Alberta community. The college was inspired by interests outside the \nuniversity's normal academic channels. It was not integrated from its inception within these \nchannels, and it has had an unsettled relationship with other parts of the university. There has \nbeen some softening of attitudes, in part attributable to the approval of the college's certificate \nprogram by General Faculties Council, and in part because there have been recent \ncollaborative efforts. But there remains a residual skepticism about the role of the college in the \nuniversity. \nOpportunities \nLeadership can be taught, and there are innumerable conferences, workshops, books and \nprograms to that end. But in Canada there is only one university college committed to \nleadership skills development: PLLC. It is now an established fact, though it rests on a \nprecarious foundation, and the question before the university is clear: after present \ncommitments are met, will the college succumb to its sustainability issues, or is distinction in the \nstudy of leadership a goal to which the university aspires? Struggling along with an uncertain \nfuture is not an option at an institution of the stature and repute of the University of Alberta. \nIn the short term there are measures that might be taken to stabilize the college. First, a \nbalanced budget in 2017-18 and subsequent years should be finalized. Second, the college \ncould explore the potential for a more equitable sharing of expenditures on this partnership \ninitiative between U of A and The Banff Centre. (the 3.5 million annual grant is being drawn \ndown at PLLC with deficits, while The Banff Centre is accumulating annual surpluses). Third, \nthe $10,000 awards to students are no longer affordable. Phasing out of the $2500 awards in \neach of years 1 and 2 is underway. The $5,000 committed to the stretch experience awards \ncould instead be a credit against fees at Peter Lougheed Hall; this would be an inducement to \nPLLC students to live there. Fourth, PLLC should explore revenue generating opportunities from \nlending its expertise in leadership programs to other organizations. \n5\n4 \nThese are possibilities only and, whatever their merits, they will not in themselves assure the \nsustainability of PLLC beyond the ten year agreement with the provincial government. That will \nrequire additional resources from government and philanthropy or a university commitment to \noperating budget support. \nMerits of PLLC Academic and Co-curricular Programming \nA second year of operation is too soon to assess these but some observations can be made. I \nheard no criticism of the academic programming; on the contrary, those in the university who \nhad an opinion on the subject viewed it positively, and PLLC staff and students are enthusiastic \nabout its quality. Some concern was expressed about its demanding nature for students already \ntaking a full course load but this could be alleviated if PLLC courses were approved as electives \nfor credit in all faculties. \nBanister Research Associates has been commissioned to undertake a review of the co-\ncurricular programs, and some results from their questionnaires are expected by year end. In \nthe interim I would suggest that the stretch program appears to be unfocused. Clearer criteria \nare needed to identify what is (and what is not) a stretch program as distinct from paid summer \nemployment. It has been suggested above that the $5 thousand award for all students in the \nprogram be used instead as a credit toward fees in Peter Lougheed Hall. An alternative might \nbe to commit some of these funds to needs based bursaries. \nI heard that the mentorship program is developing as planned. Forty mentors have been \nrecruited and demands on them are highly variable. They are available to those who seek them \nout but are not assigned to students, and this might be reconsidered. The Banister review \nshould provide more information on this subject. \nThe most challenging concerns were those expressed about the relationship between this \nprogram and other leadership initiatives at the University of Alberta. The external origins and \nearly implementation of the PLLC initiative meant that there has been no wider university \nconsideration of its nature and availability. GFC approval of the certificate was a positive step \nbut it was after the fact and not a substitute for systematic attention to program structure and \navailability, and to the relationship between PLLC and other U of A leadership commitments. \nThe sustainability issue is germane here. PLLC's long term sustainability requires that it be \nembedded within the university. It may be time to commission a university wide council of deans \nor associate deans and students to work with college leadership to this end. \n6\n5 \nPLLC's Sustainability in Leadership, Governance and Finances \nThe third of these, finances, has been addressed above and I repeat for emphasis: PLLC has \nshort and long term financial sustainability issues that must be addressed now. \nThe college has dedicated and creative leadership but on account of its origins, and its \ndesignation as an administrative rather than an academic unit, appointment and succession \nprocesses did not receive the attention usually devoted to them in the university context. \nPLLC's governance arrangements, including the present Academic Oversight Committee, are \nad hoc and fall short of what will be necessary to embed PLLC within the university and assure \nits sustainability. The administration of PLLC should report to the provost's office rather than to \nthe university president, with the resources of that office committed to early consideration of \nappointment and reappointment processes, and to the role of PLLC in the wider university. \n7\n1 \n Synthesis of Recommendations and Comments in Peter MacKinnon’s Report on \nThe Peter Lougheed Leadership College (PLLC) \nMay 2017 \nMartin Ferguson-Pell, Vice-Principal, PLLC \nThe PLLC is grateful for Peter MacKinnon’s support for the College’s vision, and appreciates his \nthoughtful input. This synthesis document is a response to the strengths, weaknesses, challenges and \nopportunities laid out in the MacKinnon Report. \nSTRENGTHS, WEAKNESSES, CHALLENGES AND OPPORTUNITIES OF PLLC \nStrengths \nStrategic Plan Alignment: There are explicit references to PLLC and also many references to \n“leadership” in the U of A Strategic Plan. PLLC is ready and poised to contribute to For the Public \nGood as the plan unfolds. \nLeadership as a possible signature area: There are interesting opportunities here. Leadership \nencompasses a broad set of soft skills that employers have identified as needed and sometimes \nlacking in the typical accomplished graduate. It is important to recognize that the need for these \nsoft skills in graduating students has been studied and illuminated by academic studies and is \nsupported by evidence. \nRecruitment of exceptional students:  We have seen progress in this area with the recruitment of a \nLoran scholar for the 2017-19 cohort and PLLC’s contribution in preparing a student from the \nFaculty of Science to be elected a Rhodes Scholar. Other excellent results include PLLC scholars \nbeing admitted to prestigious, very competitive professional programs such as in medicine, law and \nrehabilitation medicine. PLLC scholars who applied for QE2 scholarships in 2016 had a very high \nsuccess rate and their skills at interview were particularly commended. \nWeaknesses and Challenges \nFinancial sustainability: Throughout the development of PLLC we have been careful to plan for \nfinancial sustainability and enable growth to reach an intake of about 125 students per year, with \nsufficient funds to complete the 10-year GOA grant period (2024-25). We have included in our \nplanning projected inflation costs that were not accounted for in the original fixed-cost funding \nmodel.  \nNeed for new sources of revenue: New revenue sources will need to be identified from 2025 \nonwards, and we recommend consideration be given to opportunities to raise revenue in the \ninterest of PLLC’s long-term sustainability. \nManaging a full course load: It is true that if more programs could accept PLLC courses as elective \nthis would reduce the workload of PLLC students. We tend to hear this concern in the first semester \nof the first year. Discussions with second year students indicate that the skills they learn provide \n8\n2 \nnumerous systemic benefits that lead to less pressure in the winter term of year one and the second \nyear. \nPLLC, through the teaching fellows and forum structure, work closely with any students needing \nsupport. Lead Instructors, teaching fellow and the Director of Instruction hold regular office hours \nand refer students to support services if necessary. This early intervention approach is beneficial \nnot only to the student’s academic performance in PLLC, but also to academic performance in their \nprimary degree subjects. \nStretch Experience: We agree that the first year stretch program needs further development. \nChanges have already been put in place for the 2016-18 cohort; and we will continue to closely \nmonitor the program.  \nWe would like to emphasize that one of the signature features of the PLLC stretch experience is the \nopportunity to tailor the experience to each student’s personal strategy, gaps in experiences and \npersonal passions while requiring all stretch experiences to include 200+ hours of voluntary work \nfor the social benefit of the community in which the stretch experience is conducted. The \nunderlying pedagogy is to create a personal strategic challenge that some students are ill-equipped \nto handle without the support provided by the PLLC team during the planning stages.  The students \nlearn and mature through this process, an important skill for life. The mentors also play an active \nrole in connecting scholars to opportunities and supporting them through the stretch experience. \nThe process of creating the stretch experience by the scholar is as important as the experience \nitself. Opportunities to assume the responsibility of designing a learning experience, to reflect on \npersonal priorities and ambitions, and to be creative in meeting the specifications of the program \nare a rare experience for the typical, highly regulated North American undergraduate. The stretch \nexperience is therefore an important opportunity for scholars to examine their values and personal \nnarrative. \nWith regard to the stretch experience student funding, we respectfully disagree that the $5,000 \naward should be reallocated to create residence bursaries. To reallocate these funds would create \naccess issues and inequities for students who do not have the means to lose 200 hours of otherwise \npaid work during the summer. The $5,000 is closely benchmarked to funding provided for \nundergraduate research experiences by U of A, NSERC, AIHS, CIHR. \nRelationship with other U of A leadership initiatives: When PLLC was first being developed, the \nLougheed Academic Consultative Committee (LACC) was formed to ensure that broad university-\nwide perspectives were included in the planning process. LACC included faculty members, \nundergraduate student representative, graduate student representatives and deans of interested \nfaculties and units (Arts, Science, Engineering, Augustana, Dean of Students, UAI, PER). A \nsubcommittee was subsequently formed to undertake a horizon scan of leadership programs at U of \nA so that there was awareness of other programs by the PLLC leadership.  \nClose links were formed with Alberta Students Leadership Summit (PLLC has participated in the \nSummit and provided significant funding to support it from January 2015). The Emerging Leaders \nprogram, and SU initiative has similarly been supported by PLLC as sponsors, participants and \nfacilitators. PLLC has also worked closely with the U of A Ambassadors program and more recently \nwith Gold College. PLLC participated fully in the SU and Provost sponsored Interdisciplinary \nLearning conference on February 4, 2017. PLLC has also funded 10 students each year from the \nAlberta School of Business Certificate in Leadership to attend the residential Banff Retreat PLLC \nholds for its scholars. The Lougheed Lectures held every two weeks during term time are open to all \n9\n3 \non campus and beyond. We are in discussions with Campus St. Jean to consider how a version of the \nFoundations of Leadership course could be provided in French. We have worked closely with \nFaculty of Extension to share experiences with their leadership programming. Without doubt there \nare other further opportunities to extend PLLC’s collaborative activities, but these are naturally \nlimited by resources and the capacity of the lean PLLC administrative team.  \nCouncil of Deans: PLLC feels that that an advisory group of deans with a focus on strategic \ndevelopment of PLLC rather than operational oversight process would be beneficial to the further \ndevelopment of the College. Academic guidance can always be offered in this context. \nPeter Lougheed Hall: At this point, given feedback from current students in PLLC, it is unlikely that \nthe original goal of two cohorts of PLLC scholars living throughout their PLLC experience in \nresidence will be realized in the short to medium term. However, the public spaces of PLH will be of \ngreat value in providing PLLC with a physical focal point and a gathering place for PLLC scholars. \nPLH will accommodate many of PLLC’s activities such as talks and special events. In most cases \nthese opportunities will be extended to other residents in PLH creating a lively setting for \nleadership-related activities. \nThe role of the college in the university: We do not understand the skepticism surrounding PLLC and \nits role in the university, and need more guidance. Like many prestigious programs at U of A, PLLC \nis selective. The criteria for selection are widely available for review and were the result of 9 focus \ngroups with students facilitated by SU in December 2014. We seek students who have the passion, \npotential and commitment for an intensive academic and co-curricular experience.  \nWe agree with Dr. MacKinnon’s statement that “Leadership can be taught …” The concern raised by \ncolleagues with Dr. MacKinnon about this point appears to misunderstand the learning goals of \nPLLC. PLLC is not intended to generate leaders, but to provide opportunities for undergraduate \nstudents to learn leadership skills and practice them through experiential learning opportunities \nthat will serve them in many ways in their careers so that they can live consequential lives, with \nwhatever focus or role in society they may choose. All activities undertaken by PLLC, academic and \nco-curricular, are respectful of academic values. The content seeks specifically to develop \nunderstanding and insights for developing leadership skills. PLLC seeks to create an atmosphere of \nfreedom to discuss issues within the trust of a forum structure.  By creating an environment that is \nconducive to free and open discussion we create an environment that is more open to creative \nlearning and deeper understanding. \nOpportunities \nOptions for the Future: We agree the long-term financial sustainability of PLLC is a concern. PLLC’s \ncurrent budget approach will allow it to deliver content on the scale and quality originally intended \nuntil 2024-25, at which point the University, the Government of Alberta and the community at large \nwill need to make a decision for the long term. There will be 10 years of longitudinal data collected \nto demonstrate the value proposition of continuing PLLC by that time. We will have the opportunity \nto make a decision based on solid evidence.  \nMore equitable sharing of expenditures with Banff Centre: The Banff Centre, at least for the short \nterm, has agreed to cover the cost of the Banff Retreat. However, beyond this and several other \nareas of significant collaboration, we believe it is unlikely that The Banff Centre would cover costs \nthat are explicitly related to the academic costs of PLLC or the costs of Peter Lougheed Hall. \n10\n4 \nStudent Awards: We introduced the $2,500 per year award in response to concerns raised by SU \nand LACC about equitable access to PLLC for students who rely on working (especially in the \nevenings) to cover their tuition and living costs.  This is not an extraordinarily large award and is \nadministered by the Office of the Registrar. We resisted means testing this award. However, with \nPLLC scaling up it is clear that this element of the funding to students is no longer affordable and we \npropose and have budgeted for it to be replaced by a bursary fund to be administered by the Office \nof the Registrar. At present about 10% of PLLC scholars are already receiving a bursary from UofA. \nWe do not share the view that the summer stretch experience funding should be withdrawn and \nthis cost remains in the balanced budget. It is important to recognize that the stretch experience \nrequires a minimum of 200 hours of voluntary work for the social good of the community and that \nno other bursaries are available to cover off this activity outside the normal academic term. \nRevenue Generating activities: Extensive analysis has been undertaken to consider the benefits, \nfeasibility and business case for a residential summer school. This could both generate net revenue \nfor PLLC programming and also increase utilization of PLH. We request that the university give \nserious consideration to conducting a summer school pilot in 2018. \nLending expertise to other organizations: There is potential but with caution. At present there is \ninsufficient capacity in PLLC to take on contract work. There may be other groups on campus \n(Faculty of Extension, School of Business) that might want to take the lead on such initiatives and \nPLLC could certainly provide expertise in exchange for a revenue share in support of them. \n11\nItem No. 12  \nGFC EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE \nFor the Meeting of October 16, 2017 \nOUTLINE OF ISSUE \nInformation Item \nAgenda Title: Proposed Changes to the Admission of Aboriginal Students Calendar Section and \nupdates to Faculty Sections \nMotion:  THAT  General Faculties Council approve the proposed changes to the calendar sections related to \nthe admission of First Nations, Métis and Inuit students as set forth in Attachments 1 and 2, and as \nrecommended by the GFC Academic Planning Committee and the GFC Academic Standards Committee, to \ntake effect in 2018/19. \nItem   \nAction Requested Approval Recommendation Information \nProposed by Lisa Collins, Vice-Provost and University Registrar \nPresenter Lisa Collins, Vice-Provost and University Registrar \nChris Andersen, Dean, Faculty of Native Studies \nDetails \nResponsibility Provost and Vice-President (Academic) \nThe Purpose of the Proposal is \n(please be specific) \nTo update impacted calendar sections on Aboriginal Admissions. \nThe Impact of the Proposal is In order to achieve consistency across Faculties, calendar sections are \nbeing updated to indicate that proof of Aboriginal identity will be required. \nReplaces/Revises (eg, policies, \nresolutions) \nImpacted sections of the University of Alberta Calendar. \nTimeline/Implementation Date For implementation and publication in the 2018/19 University Calendar. \nEstimated Cost and funding \nsource \nN/A \nNext Steps (ie.: \nCommunications Plan, \nImplementation plans) \nThe Council on Aboriginal Initiatives requested that a First Nations, \nMetis, Inuit (FNMI) Working Group review the Admission of Aboriginal \nStudents calendar entry and prepare any recommended changes.
