Where changes to admission regulations may disadvantage students \nin the current admission cycle, normally implementation will be effective \nafter the change has been published in the University Calendar for one \nfull year (i.e., effective the second year that the information is published \nin the University Calendar). \nFor example, a change approved in May 2005 would be first published in \nthe 2006-2007 University Calendar in March 2006. Therefore the \nstatement cannot come into effect until September 2007 (affecting \napplicants who apply for the September 2007 term beginning July \n2006).” \nb.

UAPPOL Academic Standing Regulations Procedures: “All \nproposed new academic standing regulations and changes to existing \nacademic standing regulations will be submitted by the Faculties or the \nAdministration to the Provost and Vice-President (Academic). Faculties \nwill also submit to the Provost and Vice-President (Academic) any \nproposed changes to the use and/or computation of averages relating to \nacademic standing, including promotion and graduation. \nIf the Provost and Vice-President (Academic) determines the proposal to \nbe in good order, the proposal will be introduced to the appropriate \nUniversity governance process(es).

ASC will consult as necessary with the Faculties \nand with other individuals and offices in its consideration of these \nproposals.” \n3. PSLA: The PSLA gives Faculty Councils power to “provide for the \nadmission of students to the faculty” (29(1)(c)). \n4. UAPPOL Admissions Policy:  \n“Admission to the University of Alberta is based on documented \nacademic criteria established by individual Faculties and approved by \nGFC. This criteria may be defined in areas such as subject \nrequirements, minimum entrance averages, and language proficiency \nrequirements. In addition to academic requirements for admission, GFC \nauthorizes each Faculty to establish such other reasonable criteria for \nadmission of applicants as the Faculty may consider appropriate to its \nprograms of study, subject to the approval of GFC (e.g. interview, \naudition, portfolio, etc.). \nThe admission requirements for any Faculty will be those approved by \nGFC as set forth in the current edition of the University Calendar. In \naddition to the admission requirements, selection criteria for quota \nprograms, where they exist, will also be published in the current edition \nof the University Calendar. The responsibility for admission decisions will \nbe vested in the Faculty Admission Committees or in the Deans of the \nrespective Faculties, as the councils of such Faculties will determine.” \n5. UAPPOL Admissions Procedure: \n“PROCEDURE \n1. EFFECTIVE DATE OF CHANGES TO ADMISSION REGULATIONS \nFollowing approval by GFC: \na. Where changes to admission regulations may disadvantage \nstudents in the current admission cycle, normally implementation will be \neffective after the change has been published in the University Calendar \nfor one full year (I.e., effective the second year that the information is \npublished in the University Calendar). For example, a change approved \nin May 2005 would be first published in the 2006-2007 University \nCalendar in March 2006. Therefore the statement cannot come into \neffect until September 2007 (affecting applicants who apply for the \nSeptember 2007 term beginning July 2006). \nb. Where changes to admission regulations are deemed by the \napproving body to be ‘advantageous to students’, normally the date of \nimplementation will be effective immediately or at the next available \nintake for the admitting Faculty.” \n6. PSLA: The PSLA gives Faculty Councils the authority to “determine \nthe conditions under which a student must withdraw from or may \n3\nItem No. 5 \nGFC ACADEMIC STANDARDS COMMITTEE \nFor the Meeting of November 16, 2017  \ncontinue the student’s program of studies in a faculty” (Section 29(1)(d)). \n7. UAPPOL Academic Standing Policy:  \n“All current academic standing regulations, including academic standing \ncategories, University graduating standards and requirements for all \nindividual programs will be those prescribed by Faculty Councils and \nGFC as set forth in the University Calendar.” \n8. UAPPOL Academic Standing Regulations Procedures: \n “All proposed new academic standing regulations and changes to \nexisting academic standing regulations will be submitted by the Faculties \nor the Administration to the Provost and Vice-President (Academic). \nFaculties will also submit to the Provost and Vice-President (Academic) \nany proposed changes to the use and/or computation of averages \nrelating to academic standing, including promotion and graduation. \nIf the Provost and Vice-President (Academic) determines the proposal to \nbe in good order, the proposal will be introduced to the appropriate \nUniversity governance process(es). In considering these proposals, \ngovernance bodies will consult as necessary with the Faculties and with \nother individuals and offices. \nNormally, changes become effective once they are approved by GFC or \nits delegate and are published in the University Calendar.” \nAttachments (each to be numbered 1 - 9) \n1.

The \nmedian will then be determined by the applicant pool. This \nchange was added at the recommendation of Michele Moroz, \nAssistant Registrar.  \n- The removal of wording around the number of required credits to \nmeet criteria of a full course load is being removed to ensure \ninclusion of students holding a full course load while being \naccommodated in any way.  \n- The purpose of adding the Academic Standing state of \n“Unsatisfactory Standing” is to allow for instances of a repeat \nyear in specific circumstances. This aligns with other Faculty of \nMedicine & Dentistry professional programs that allow a repeat \nyear.  \n- The purpose of changing the final decision maker regarding \nreexaminations from the Program Director to the RADTH \nAcademic Standings Committee is to ensure that decisions such \nas this are vetted by a larger group rather than the discretion of \none person. This change was also a recommendation from the \nprogram’s accreditation process, which was completed in 2016. \n- The removal of specific clinical site listings is to allow the \nprogram to grow and expand without need for specific changes \nto the sites listed.  \nThe Impact of the Proposal is That the Calendar will reflect the updated wording and additions made \nwithin the admission and academic regulations for the Radiation \nTherapy Program. \nReplaces/Revises (eg, policies, \nresolutions) \nRevises admission and academic regulations for the Radiation Therapy \nProgram. \nTimeline/Implementation Date Fall 2018 \nEstimated Cost and funding \nsource \nNo additional cost \nItem No. 10 \nGFC ACADEMIC STANDARDS COMMITTEE \nFor the Meeting of November 16, 2017 \nNext Steps (ie.: \nCommunications Plan, \nImplementation plans) \nInformation items only, no next steps required. \nSupplementary Notes and \ncontext \nAfter discussion at the October 19 ASC meeting, the Faculty decided to \nrefine the proposal further; these additional changes are highlighted in \ngreen in the attached document. \nEngagement and Routing (Include meeting dates) \nParticipation: \n(parties who have seen the \nproposal and in what \ncapacity) \n• Those who have \nbeen informed \n• Those who have \nbeen consulted \nThose who are actively \nparticipating  \n• Radiation Therapy Program Curriculum Committee  \n• Radiation Therapy Academic Standings Committee \n• Radiation Therapy Admissions Committee \n• Faculty Learning Committee – reviewed and approved – June 23, \n2017 \n• FoMD Faculty Council Committee – reviewed and approved – \nJuly 17, 2016  \n• Office of the Registrar, Calendar Production – consulted/informed \nApproval Route (Governance) \n(including meeting dates) \nGFC ASC Subcommittee on Standards – October 5, 2017 \nGFC Academic Standards Committee – October 19, 2017; November \n16, 2017 \nFinal Approver GFC Academic Standards Committee \nAlignment/Compliance \nAlignment with Guiding \nDocuments \nFor the Public Good \nGOAL: EXCEL as individuals, and together, sustain a culture that fosters \nand champions distinction and distinctiveness in teaching, learning, \nresearch, and service. \nTo excel and achieve our full potential as an institution and as \nindividuals, the University of Alberta will sustain a learning and research \nculture that inspires, supports, and champions high professional \nstandards and outstanding achievements in basic and applied research \nand scholarship, creative activity, administration, and governance. \nCompliance with Legislation, \nPolicy and/or Procedure \nRelevant to the Proposal \n(please quote legislation and \ninclude identifying section \nnumbers) \n1. Post-Secondary Learning Act (PSLA): The PSLA gives GFC \nresponsibility, subject to the authority of the Board of Governors, over \nacademic affairs (Section 26(1)). Further, the PSLA gives the Board of \nGovernors authority over certain admission requirements and rules \nrespecting enrolment (Section 60(1)(c) and (d)). The Board has \ndelegated its authority over admissions requirements and rules \nrespecting enrolment to GFC. GFC has thus established an Academic \nStandards Committee (ASC). \n2. PSLA: The PSLA gives Faculty Councils power to “provide for the \nadmission of students to the faculty” (29(1)(c)). \nItem No. 10 \nGFC ACADEMIC STANDARDS COMMITTEE \nFor the Meeting of November 16, 2017 \n3. UAPPOL Admissions Policy: “Admission to the University of Alberta \nis based on documented academic criteria established by individual \nFaculties and approved by GFC. This criteria may be defined in areas \nsuch as subject requirements, minimum entrance averages, and \nlanguage proficiency requirements. In addition to academic requirements \nfor admission, GFC authorizes each Faculty to establish such other \nreasonable criteria for admission of applicants as the Faculty may \nconsider appropriate to its programs of study, subject to the approval of \nGFC (e.g. interview, audition, portfolio, etc.) \nThe admission requirements for any Faculty will be those approved by \nGFC as set forth in the current edition of the University Calendar. In \naddition to the admission requirements, selection criteria for quota \nprograms, where they exist, will also be published in the current edition \nof the University Calendar. The responsibility for admission decisions will \nbe vested in the Faculty Admission Committees or in the Deans of the \nrespective Faculties, as the councils of such Faculties will determine.” \n4. UAPPOL Admissions Procedure: \n“PROCEDURE \n1. EFFECTIVE DATE OF CHANGES TO ADMISSION REGULATIONS \nFollowing approval by GFC: \na. Where changes to admission regulations may disadvantage students \nin the current admission cycle, normally implementation will be \neffective after the change has been published in the University \nCalendar for one full year (i.e., effective the second year that the \ninformation is published in the University Calendar). \nFor example, a change approved in May 2005 would be first published in \nthe 2006-2007 University Calendar in March 2006. Therefore the \nstatement cannot come into effect until September 2007 (affecting \napplicants who apply for the September 2007 term beginning July 2006). \nb. Where changes to admission regulations are deemed by the \napproving body to be ‘advantageous to students’, normally the date of \nimplementation will be effective immediately or at the next available \nintake for the admitting Faculty.” \n5. PSLA: The PSLA gives Faculty Councils the authority to “determine \nthe conditions under which a student must withdraw from or may \ncontinue the student’s program of studies in a faculty” (Section \n29(1)(d)). \n6. UAPPOL Academic Standing Policy: All current academic standing \nregulations, including academic standing categories, University \ngraduating standards and requirements for all individual programs will \nbe those prescribed by Faculty Councils and GFC as set forth in the \nUniversity Calendar. \n7. GFC Academic Standards Committee  Terms of Reference (3. \nMandate): \n“A. Definitions \ni. Routine and/or Editorial \n[…] the term “routine and/or editorial” refers to proposals which do not \ninvolve or affect other Faculties or units; do not form part of a proposal \nItem No. 10 \nGFC ACADEMIC STANDARDS COMMITTEE \nFor the Meeting of November 16, 2017 \nfor a new program; and which do not involve alternation of an existing \nquota or establishment of a new quota. Editorial or routine changes \ninclude any and all change to the wording or an admissions or academic \nstanding policy.” \n“B. Admission and Transfer, Academic Standing, Marking and Grading, \nTerm Work, Examinations, […] \ni. All proposals from the Faculties or the Administration related to \nadmission and transfer, to the academic standing of students, to \ninstitutional marking and grading policies and/or procedures and to term \nwork policies and procedures are submitted to the Provost and Vice-\nPresident (Academic) (or delegate) who chairs the GFC Academic \nStandards Committee. ASC will consult as necessary with the Faculties \nand with other individuals and offices in its consideration of these \nproposals. \nii. ASC acts for GFC in approving routine and/or editorial changes to \nboth admission/transfer policies and academic standing regulations” \nAttachments: \n1.

Selection Process: A minimum GPA \nof 3.2 is required in preprofessional \ncourse work. The selection process is \ncompetitive, and applicants will be \nranked primarily on academic \nachievement in the prerequisite \ncourses. Preference will be given to \nresidents of Alberta. Other factors \nconsidered in ranking include overall \nacademic achievement (emphasizing \nrecent academic performance), a \ndemonstrated ability to perform well in \na consecutive Fall/Winter Term of full-\ntime study (preferably 30 units). a \npersonal interview, and a career \nreflection letter. \nOther Requirements \n1.

Preference will be given to \nresidents of Alberta. Other factors \nconsidered in ranking include overall \nacademic achievement (emphasizing \nrecent academic performance), a \ndemonstrated ability to perform well in a \nconsecutive Fall/Winter Term of full-time \nor equivalent study, a personal interview, \nand a career reflection letter. \nRationale:  The program would like to allow students under the GPA of 3.2 apply to the \nprogram.  This will allow the applicant pool to determine the GPA.  This calendar change \nwas decided upon by the Radiation Therapy Program Admission Committee at the \nrecommendation of Michelle Moroz, Assistant Registrar, who is a member of this \ncommittee. \nThe wording change from “full-time study (preferably 30 units) to full-time or equivalent \nstudy comes as a recommendation to reflect that the program will still consider applicants \nwho have not taken full course loads due to duty to accommodate situations. \n4. Personal Interview: Interview \nselection is based on postsecondary \nacademic records and a career \nreflection letter received by April 1 \n(see Admission and Readmission \nDeadlines). Selected applicants will \nbe interviewed to determine if they \nhave the personal qualities necessary \nfor the profession. The interview \nevaluates an applicant's empathy, \ncommunication, teamwork, reflection, \nconflict resolution, responsibility, \ninitiative, problem-solving, \nprioritization and organization. Short-\nlisted applicants will be advised of the \ninterview date. \n4. Personal Interview: Interview selection is \nbased on postsecondary academic \nrecords and a career reflection letter \nreceived by April 1 (see Admission and \nReadmission Deadlines). Selected \napplicants will be interviewed to \ndetermine if they have the personal \nqualities necessary for the profession. \nThe interview evaluates an applicant's \nempathy, communication, teamwork, \nreflection, conflict resolution, \nresponsibility, initiative, problem-solving, \ncritical thinking, prioritization and \norganization. Short-listed applicants will \nbe advised of the interview date. \nRationale:  This component has always been evaluated in our MMIs and has been missing \nfrom this description. \nhttp://calendar.ualberta.ca/content.php?catoid=20&navoid=5136#admission_and_readmission_deadlines\nhttp://calendar.ualberta.ca/content.php?catoid=20&navoid=5136#admission_and_readmission_deadlines\nhttp://calendar.ualberta.ca/content.php?catoid=20&navoid=5136#admission_and_readmission_deadlines\nhttp://calendar.ualberta.ca/content.php?catoid=20&navoid=5136#admission_and_readmission_deadlines\nFaculty of Medicine & Dentistry \nRadiation Therapy Program  \nCourse Changes 2018-2019 \nCurrent 2017/2018 Proposed 2018/2019 \nDegree of BSc in Radiation Therapy – Academic Regulations \nPromotion and Academic Performance \na. Academic Performance: Progression \nin the program is term by term. \nAccordingly, all students in a particular \nco-hort of the program normally should \nbe registered in the same courses in \neach term (see Degree of BSc in \nRadiation Therapy.) Students will not \nnormally register in any core (i.e., non-\nelective) courses from a particular term \nof the program until they have \nsatisfactorily completed core courses \nfrom the previous term of the program. \nStudents are also held accountable to \nthe University's Code of Student \nBehaviour and should be familiar with \nit.
