Before graduate degree \nspecializations are approved by the FGSR, it must be clear that the department’s proposed designation \ndoes not require significant additional resources, that it has sufficient viability in terms of numbers of \nacademic staff in the research area, and that a library impact assessment has been completed. \nAccording to the Academic Planning Committee’s terms of reference, all proposals for the establishment \nof graduate degree specializations shall be submitted to the Dean of the Faculty of Graduate Studies and \nResearch. The Dean, after consultation, may approve proposals which do not involve base operating or \ncapital funds; the Dean will report these approvals to the Academic Planning Committee for information. \nListed below are proposals approved since August 1, 2015. \nDepartment of Medical Microbiology and Immunology \nExisting Specializations in MSc and \nPhD programs \nMycology \nMacromolecular Crystallography \nClinical Microbiology \nTermination \nThroughout the years the expertise of the department has changed and we can no longer offer \nMSc/PhD programs in the subjects in which we lack expertise. The disciplines of mycology, \nmacromolecular crystallography and clinical microbiology are not available to prospective \nstudents. \nSchool of Public Health \nSpecialization in MPH \nFood Safety New \nRationale: The MPH in Food Safety is a unique program that will teach the students food \nsafety with emphasis on public health rather than on food science.  The interdisciplinary \neducation of the MPH in Food Safety will help the students to develop a strong skillset in \npublic health aspects of food safety such as disease/illness outcomes, foodborne disease \nsurveillance, outbreak investigation, epidemiology, toxicology, risk assessment, risk \nmanagement, etc. These elements are currently lacking in food safety programs nationally \nand internationally, but are critical to government and industry for development of food \nsafety policies and programs in boosting public confidence in Alberta’s commitment to safe \nfood.  These aspects contribute towards the much needed educational basis to train future \nleaders in food safety. \nhttp://www.gradstudies.ualberta.ca/\nFaculty of Graduate Studies and Research \n4 \nDepartment of Modern Languages and Cultural Studies \nSpecializations in MA and PhD \nprograms \nExisting Specializations: \nFrench Language, Literatures and \nLinguistics \nGermanic Languages, Literatures and \nLinguistics \nItalian Studies  \nSlavic Languages and Literatures  \nSlavic Linguistics \nSpanish and Latin American Studies \nUkrainian Folklore \nSuspension/Termination \nComparative Literature Name Change to: \nTransnational and Comparative Literatures \nMedia and Cultural Studies New \nPrior to this change Modern Languages and Cultural Studies had ten secondary \nspecializations. This number was unsustainable, and we were unable to retain a cohort of \nstudents for each specialization, which in turn translated into fewer graduate-only courses and \nprogram not best suited to student needs. The restructuring of our specializations into four \ndisciplinary specific (as opposed to a mixture of disciplinary specific and area studies) \nspecializations allows for our programs to better address student needs; not only will students \nwork in cohorts and take primarily graduate-only courses, the program will better be able to \nsustain changes in student populations and interests over time. \nDepartment of Dentistry (through Medical Sciences) \nSpecialization in MSc and PhD \nMedical Sciences-Periodontology New \nRationale: As the Canadian population ages and the association between periodontal disease and \nsystemic disease becomes better understood there is increased need for specialty periodontics \ntraining. To date, there are only 4 English periodontology programs throughout Canada. In 2014 there \nwere about 100 academically qualified applicants for the 9-10 positions available in the existing 4 \nEnglish speaking programs. First admissions will be Fall 2017. \nFaculty of Rehabilitation Medicine \nPost-Baccalaureate Certificate \nSexual Health Formerly offered by Extension \nRationale: The Post-Baccalaureate Certificate in Sexual Health will no longer be offered jointly \nbetween the faculties of Extension and Rehabilitation Medicine. The program will be offered by \nthe Faculty of Rehabilitation Medicine. \nFaculty of Graduate Studies and Research \n5 \nDepartment of Educational Policy Studies \nPost-Baccalaureate Certificate \nTeaching and Learning in Higher \nEducation  \nFormerly offered by Extension \nRationale: The Post-Baccalaureate Certificate in Teaching and Learning in Higher Education, \nformerly offered by the Faculty of Extension, is now being offered by the Department of \nEducational Policy Studies. \n\tItem-1-Agenda\n\tItem-4-Yonsei-dual-degree\n\t4-OI-dual-degree-FGSR-FPER-Yonsie\n\t4-8.0 Yonsei-UAlberta Dual Doctoral Degree Program Agreement FGSRMay2016\n\tBETWEEN YONSEI UNIVERSITY\n\t(“YONSEI”)\n\tAND THE GOVERNORS OF THE UNIVERSITY OF ALBERTA\n\tProtection of Privacy - The personal information requested on this form is collected under the authority of the applicable privacy or data protection legislation and will be protected under the applicable act.
