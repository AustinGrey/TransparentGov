            "Description": "Purpose of the Proposal: To inform the members of the responsibilities and functions of the Campus Alberta Quality Council and to discuss Student Learning Outcomes. Discussion: Dr Quinney thanked members for the invitation to attend and added that he has met with several other institutions recently to give this presentation. Dr Quinney then provided an overview of the history and role of the CAQC noting that it was established by the Provincial Government in 2004 and is defined in the Post-Secondary Learning Act (PSLA). He spoke about the CAQC’s role in the program approval process and noted that it is one of three approval stages, with the system coordination review and the Minister’s decision being the other two. While the CAQC has a monitoring role for new programs, Dr Quinney noted that, in recognition of the maturity of the processes within the Comprehensive Academic and Research Institutions (CARIs), the role normally consists of a regular audit of the institution’s internal quality assurance policies and processes for academic review. Dr Mahaffy provided an overview of the Alberta Forum on Post-secondary Learning Outcomes: Sharing Principles, Effective Practices, and Challenges, jointly organized by the CAQC with the Alberta Council on Admissions and Transfer (ACAT) and the Ministry of Advanced Education and held on May 18, 2016. The committee had an extensive discussion the role of learning outcomes in student mobility. Members expressed concern that course equivalencies could not be determined on the basis of a comparison of learning outcomes alone. Dr Mahaffy reported that this concern was also noted at the forum and recognized that learning outcomes could not be viewed in isolation, but required context and nuance to interpret. Dr Mahaffy also noted that programs can undergo a lot of incremental changes which, when viewed through the learning outcomes lens, can reveal a substantial change to program such that it now serves a very different student than originally envisioned. It was noted that government is notified of significant changes to programs and that the Minister reserves the right to refer to programs to the CAQC even if institution does not view the change as substantive.",

            "Description": "Purpose of the Proposal: The University Statement on Equity and the Student Statement on Equity are being revised to reflect changes to Alberta Human Rights Legislation and changing norms in diversity and equity within the academy. The committee is being asked to review and provide advice on the proposal at this time; a revised proposal will be submitted for governance approval in the fall. Discussion: During the discussion, members provided feedback on language changes within the proposal including the removal of racialized and socio-economic and commented on the increase to the length of the course syllabi which would occur by adding further information to it. The Chair reported that a group has been established to review the content and volume of information required in course syllabi and that recommendations would be brought forward to ASC at a later date. A member suggested that the Statement on Equity would have greater impact if located somewhere other than in a course syllabus. The Registrar noted that the proposed changes reflect the protected grounds outlined in the Human Rights and the federal employment equity legislation. Members raised questions about the University’s commitment and responsibility to ensuring diverse socio-economic backgrounds which is not a protected ground but remains an important factor. It was also suggested that the language of diversity continues to evolve and regular review of the terms used would be appropriate. Ms Collins reported that an official proposal would be circulated for approval through governance in the fall.",

We are working together \non this Forum because we share the view that student learning outcomes should play a greater role in \nquality assurance and the transfer of credits and, as a result, the success of students.  \nThe plan is to spend a day talking about the role for student learning outcomes, how they can be \neffectively implemented and the need for their assessment, and to share experiences with and plans for \nthe use of learning outcomes in the Alberta post-secondary system.  External experts on student learning \noutcomes will bring provincial, national, and international perspectives and experiences to stimulate and \nguide the discussion.   \nFORUM OBJECTIVES    \n1. To share experiences and effective practices within Alberta institutions around the use of learning \noutcomes at the institutional level, in the design of new programs and courses, in the review of \nquality of programs and courses, and in the assessment of course and program transfer. \n2. To provide an overview of the potential role for learning outcomes and their assessment in quality \nassurance in Alberta, Canada, and internationally. \n3. To provide an overview of the potential role for learning outcomes and their assessment in course \nand program transfer in Alberta, Canada, and internationally. \n4. To inform CAQC, ACAT, and the Ministry of Advanced Education with respect to the use and \nassessment of learning outcomes. \n5. To identify the necessary conditions and opportunities for effectively using learning outcomes in the \nquality assurance and transfer arrangements at the institutional and system levels. \n6. To identify next steps in sharing of information or collaboration within Alberta with respect to \nlearning outcomes.  \n2 \nPRESENTERS   \nTRUDY BANTA – Professor of Higher Education and Senior Advisor to the Chancellor \nfor Planning and Institutional Improvement at Indiana University-Purdue University \nIndianapolis, has developed and coordinated 26 US national assessment conferences and 15 \ninternational conferences, publishes widely on assessment, and serves on the National \nAdvisory Panel for the (US) National Institute for Learning Outcomes Assessment. \nhttp://www.learningoutcomesassessment.org/AdvisoryPanel.html and \nhttps://education.iupui.edu/faculty-research/directory/banta-trudy.html \nSANDY WELSH – Vice-Provost, Students, at the University of Toronto and Vice-Chair of \nthe Appraisal Committee of the Ontario Universities Council on Quality Assurance, has \nexperience in the implementation of learning outcomes at both the institutional level and as \npart of the assessment of quality assurance at the provincial level.

Structurally speaking, the Canadian system does \nnot look much different than it did 50 years ago. But the system’s dynamics have changed considerably: \nreduced government funding and the tough economic climate make efficient financial models a necessity \nfor healthy institutions; student debt loads are increasing; underemployment is a reality for many \nundergraduate degree-holders; and the student body is increasingly diverse, with growing numbers of \ninternational students, students from historically underrepresented groups, mature students returning to \nPSE to improve career prospects, and students having to work at least part-time to manage the cost of \neducation. To ensure that our system is accountable, accessible and of the highest quality, we need to \ndefine and assess educational outcomes at both the institutional and student levels. \nAgainst this backdrop, postsecondary learning outcomes are rapidly replacing credit hours as the preferred \nunit of measurement for learning. Not only do learning outcomes lend themselves to a common language of \nskill development, but they are also multipurpose: in Ontario alone they have been used, to varying degrees, \nin quality assurance, professional accreditation, program standards, qualifications frameworks, curriculum \ndesign, skills assessments and credit transfer agreements. However, the expanded presence of learning \noutcomes at the postsecondary level has outstripped our abilities to validate those outcomes through \nassessment, both in terms of the quantity and diversity of outcomes and the comparability of the language \nused. \nIndeed, the boom in postsecondary learning outcomes can be difficult to navigate. Not all institutions use \nthe same terminology to articulate skills and competencies, which affects the extent to which outcomes can \nbe assessed and interpreted reliably. HEQCO’s response to these circumstances has been structured around \na typology including four different classes of postsecondary learning outcome appropriate to the Ontario \ncontext: basic cognitive skills, discipline-specific skills, higher-order cognitive skills and transferrable skills. \nTogether, these categories can be used to guide postsecondary outcomes assessment and, in doing so, \ncreate a shared foundation for postsecondary learning quality. Moreover, the four categories provide a set \nof interpretive lenses that can bring into greater focus the different assessment and policy considerations \nfor each domain. \nThis report applies the four categories to the current state of learning outcomes assessment in \npostsecondary education, examining the different dynamics of each in detail, as well as areas of overlap \nbetween them. We then identify the unique challenges and opportunities presented by the four different \nstrands of learning outcomes, with the goal of clarifying existing outcomes frameworks and identifying areas \nfor further development and assessment. \nIf implemented properly, the learning outcomes approach can serve the purposes of accountability and \nquality measurement. However, it is not enough to revise policy infrastructure and map outcomes across \ncredentials. In order for a system to be truly outcomes-based, we need to prove that students are \ngraduating with the skills they need to succeed. Assessment remains the keystone of the learning outcomes \napproach at the postsecondary level, though it is not always taken seriously. If given proper consideration, \nlearning outcomes assessment could be an invaluable source of strength and flexibility for a system in \ntransition. \nThe Language of Learning Outcomes: Definitions and Assessments \nHigher Education Quality Council of Ontario 3  \nTable of Contents \nIntroduction ......................................................................................................................................................... 4 \n1.

While this statistic is often lauded, its meaning and significance is evolving. As the cost of \ngetting a postsecondary education rises and as more and more individuals come to possess a postsecondary \ncredential, students, stakeholders and employers are increasingly looking beyond attainment rates to \nconsider institutional accountability, learning quality and labour market alignment as ways of measuring the \neffectiveness of the postsecondary system. Are students learning the skills and knowledge they need to be \nsuccessful in work and life? The answer to this question requires a change in focus to the definition and \nassessment of student learning outcomes.  \nGenerally speaking, learning outcomes are “broad, yet direct statements that describe the competences \nthat students should possess (i.e., what students should know and be able to demonstrate) upon completion \nof a course or program” (Kenny, 2011). By defining clear objectives for student learning that are aligned with \nassessment and credential frameworks, and by linking skills to demonstrable student behaviours that can in \nturn be assessed, the learning outcomes approach can:  \n allow educators, administrators and policymakers to assess whether or not students are actually \nlearning the skills that institutions claim to be teaching;  \n allow institutions to identify and implement teaching practices that effectively develop student \nskills, rather than focusing simply on the delivery and acquisition of disciplinary content; and  \n create a common language so that members of the PSE sector, the labour market and the public can \ndiscuss what is expected of postsecondary graduates. \nThis last point can be particularly important for students. If they can clearly articulate the life skills and \ncompetencies they have acquired, they may be better equipped to understand the value of their education \nand to market their skills more effectively to employers or graduate programs.  \nAlthough the learning outcomes approach is rooted in American psychology, it gained particular momentum \nin Europe with the launch of the Bologna Process in 1999, which sought to align PSE outcomes and \ncredentials across EU countries (Krathwohl, 2002; Kennedy et al., 2006). Learning outcomes have since \nbecome the subject of experimentation and research at educational institutions around the world (Lennon \net al., 2014). While this work has generated a considerable body of literature on the topic, it has also given \nrise to a myriad of ways of interpreting and realizing the objectives of learning outcomes, many of which are \nparticular to specific institutions or disciplines. At the same time, the development of learning outcomes at \nthe institution level has compromised one of the ultimate goals of the learning outcomes approach – the \ndevelopment of a common language for student learning that might be applied across sectors or institutions \n(Blaich & Wise, 2011).  \nOntario already uses the language of learning outcomes. The Ontario Qualifications Framework (OQF), for \nexample, identifies specific graduate competencies for a full range of credentials offered at the province’s \npostsecondary institutions (Ontario MTCU, 2009b). Ontario’s commitment to learning outcomes is also \ndemonstrated in the universities’ Degree-Level Expectations (DLEs) and the colleges’ Essential Employability \nSkills (EESs) profile, both of which outline the skills a student is expected to possess by the end of their \nThe Language of Learning Outcomes: Definitions and Assessments \nHigher Education Quality Council of Ontario 5  \ncourse of study (Ontario MTCU, 2009a; COU, 2011). The way in which this language has been interpreted \nand applied at the institutional level, however, has often varied.  \nHEQCO’s own work on the topic of learning outcomes has sought to bridge this gap by developing a \nlanguage to describe the skills expected of postsecondary students that could be applied across the Ontario \ncontext. This typology of learning outcomes was first proposed by Weingarten (2014, Feb. 13) and outlines \nfour classes of learning outcomes:  \n1) Basic cognitive skills, such as literacy and numeracy;  \n2) Disciplinary content, referring to the knowledge and content students are expected to have \nacquired in their field of study; \n3) Higher-order cognitive skills, such as problem solving and critical thinking; and \n4) Transferable life skills, sometimes called ‘soft skills’ or ‘essential skills’ and including behavioural and \npersonality attributes such as initiative, resilience and time management. \nThe purpose of this report is to further develop HEQCO’s approach to learning outcomes by discussing and \ndescribing each of these categories in greater detail, while acknowledging the overlap and the gray areas \nbetween them. The report draws heavily on the literature to move this typology from one that was \npresented in a preliminary fashion in Weingarten (2014, Feb. 13) to one whose form and content is made \nclear by grounding it in relevant research. To achieve this end, the report moves through each of the \nlearning outcomes categories mentioned above in turn to discuss how each group of outcomes is \nconceptualized and what specific skills or knowledge it contains. The report also outlines the various \nmethods and tools that exist to assess each of the categories of learning outcomes. \n1. Basic Cognitive Learning Outcomes \nBasic cognitive skills include literacy and numeracy (Weingarten, 2014, Feb. 13). These skills make up the \nfoundation of every level of education and in recent years have been restructured around learning \noutcomes in many countries. On the one hand, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and \nDevelopment (OECD) has correlated literacy and numeracy proficiency with increased labour market \nparticipation and higher wages, highlighting the clear benefits of well-developed basic cognitive skills (OECD, \n2013). On the other hand, however, literacy and numeracy skills are a point of perennial concern in Canada, \nas OECD assessments of Canadians’ skill levels show no real improvement over the last 20 years (Dion & \nMaldonado, 2013).  \nThough literacy and numeracy make up a significant part of the K-12 curriculum, basic cognitive outcomes \nare also important in PSE, as these skills are foundational to more complex study as well as to employability. \nAt the elementary and secondary levels, literacy and numeracy are measured against provincial curriculum \nstandards for each grade. There are no comparable standards in PSE, and the definitions and assessments \nused by individual institutions vary considerably. While Ontario’s colleges and universities are committed to \nproducing literate and numerate graduates, the current approach to teaching and assessing basic cognitive \noutcomes is unsystematic. \nThe identification of basic cognitive skills requires that we distinguish these foundational skills from \nassociated, though more abstract, higher-order cognitive outcomes. In other words, it is not always easy to \nThe Language of Learning Outcomes: Definitions and Assessments \nHigher Education Quality Council of Ontario 6  \ndetermine where literacy and numeracy end and more specialized communication and mathematical skills \nbegin. Despite the difficulties it presents, this distinction is essential to designing meaningful, appropriate \noutcomes assessments at the postsecondary level. As students enter PSE with a broad range of skill sets and \nabilities, it is increasingly clear that postsecondary institutions need to establish a baseline level of \ncompetency for basic cognitive outcomes and assess these skills upon admission to ensure that students \npossess a strong base of literacy and numeracy skills upon which more complex skills can be built (Dion & \nMaldonado, 2013). \nThe conceptualization of basic cognitive learning outcomes presents a number of other challenges. One \nconcerns the lack of conceptual clarity around literacy and numeracy, which affects the extent to which we \ncan measure these skills effectively. Another concerns the lack of clarity in postsecondary policy around the \nfoundational importance of basic cognitive outcomes for higher learning. While individual postsecondary \ninstitutions use a variety of definitions and assessment tools to measure literacy and numeracy skills, there \nis still confusion about the importance and value of basic cognitive outcomes for all students in all disciplines \nin any course of postsecondary study. \nThe discussion below touches on both of these points, outlining the ambiguous value afforded to basic \ncognitive outcomes in PSE and the general lack of distinction between basic cognitive skills and higher-order \nskills. This ambiguity makes it easy to neglect basic cognitive skills at the postsecondary level, relegating \nthem instead to the K-12 sector and focusing only on higher-order skills. We close the section by discussing \nthe various methods available to assess the development of basic cognitive skills. \n1.1 Basic Cognitive Outcomes and Postsecondary Policy \nThe importance of basic cognitive outcomes in PSE is not always articulated clearly in qualifications and \ncredentials frameworks. This occurs in part because postsecondary education in a given province or territory \nis supported by several layers of policy guidelines, each originating from a different source. Though the \nCouncil of Ministers of Education’s Ministerial Statement on the Quality Assurance of Degree Education in \nCanada (2007), a shared point of reference for all provinces and territories, makes clear the importance of \nbasic cognitive outcomes in a postsecondary context, it is perhaps not surprising that some of that clarity is \nlost in translation by the time it trickles down to the institutional level. \nWe can observe this ambiguous emphasis on basic cognitive outcomes in Ontario, where the lack of clarity \naround basic cognitive outcomes results in part from their situation in the various provincial frameworks. \nThe emphasis on literacy would seem to be relatively clear, with the OQF identifying literacy as one of a set \nof communication skills expected of graduates (Ontario MTCU, 2009b). Numeracy, however, is never \nmentioned explicitly and is not housed in its own category. While the OQF does make reference to data \nanalysis skills, some of which might be assumed to be quantitative, these skills are presented in discipline-\nspecific contexts, making it more difficult to argue that numeracy is a desirable skill for all graduates, \nincluding those studying in non-quantitative fields (Ontario MTCU, 2009b; Dion, 2014). Since the OQF \ninforms the DLEs and EESs, this ambiguity is passed down the line.  \nThe DLEs draw no clear distinction between basic cognitive and higher-order skills. It is also lacking from the \nEssential Employability Skills profile, which discusses skills that could reasonably be seen to fit either \ncategory, such as the ability to “communicate clearly, concisely and correctly in the written, spoken, and \nThe Language of Learning Outcomes: Definitions and Assessments \nHigher Education Quality Council of Ontario 7  \nvisual form that fulfills the purpose and meets the needs of the audience; respond to written, spoken, or \nvisual messages in a manner that ensures effective communication; and execute mathematical operations \naccurately” (Ontario MTCU, 2009a).  \nThe OQF, DLEs and EESs set the tone for the postsecondary sector’s attitude toward basic cognitive \noutcomes. While institutions are aware that literacy and numeracy are important skills, there is often little \nsystematic approach to developing them further in PSE. Basic cognitive skills are seen to be a prerequisite \nfor PSE but not necessarily an outcome of it, with the value-added of postsecondary coming instead with \nhigher-order skills. This thinking is reflected in the college sector’s tendency to administer literacy and \nnumeracy tests to incoming cohorts, so students needing remedial attention can be identified early on. In \nthe university sector, meanwhile, explicit basic cognitive skills instruction is typically limited to remedial \nsettings. Exit testing is rare at both levels for the same reasons (Dion, 2014). This lack of emphasis on basic \ncognitive skills in PSE can be linked, at least in part, to the ambiguities of the relevant qualifying frameworks. \nThis state of affairs is not unique to Canada. In the American postsecondary system, the definition and \nposition of basic cognitive outcomes are just as blurred. Some institutions incorporate literacy and \nnumeracy development into general education courses. Others offer (and in some cases require) intensive \ncourses in writing, analytic reading and mathematics to be completed within the first year of study as a way \nof preparing students for discipline-specific work (Ewell, 2012). Postsecondary policy frameworks offer little \ndirection either way: American institutions have long relied on standardized admissions tests to guarantee \nsufficient literacy and numeracy skill levels among incoming students, and policymakers have only recently \nbegun to pay serious attention to research disputing the accuracy and validity of those measurements (Hiss \n& Franks, 2014). Both the Lumina Foundation’s Degree Qualification Profile and the National Leadership \nCouncil for Liberal Education and America’s Promise’s (LEAP) College Learning for the New Global Century \nclearly outline basic cognitive outcomes for the postsecondary level, but these documents are informative \nrather than binding (LEAP, 2007; Lumina Foundation, 2011). As in Canada’s PSE sector, American colleges \ntake no systematic approach to developing basic cognitive outcomes and are not motivated to do so by \nexisting postsecondary policy.  \nIn the European Union, on the other hand, the significance of basic cognitive outcomes is supported by the \nJoint Quality Initiative’s Dublin Descriptors. The descriptors, like much of the policy work that grew out of \nthe Bologna Process, emphasize skill- or discipline-specific rather than general education. As a result, basic \ncognitive outcomes are typically embedded within courses, programs and institutions, and delivered in the \ncontext of a student’s chosen field or profession (Krueger & Kumar, 2003). This ensures that programs \nacross the EU approach basic cognitive outcomes consistently, regardless of the institution or jurisdiction. \n1.2 Basic Cognitive Outcomes and Postsecondary Assessment \nWhile conceptual and structural clarity lay the groundwork for thorough learning outcomes assessment, a \nvariety of tools already exists to assess basic cognitive outcomes at different points across the learning \ncontinuum. Standardized tests remain popular methods of gathering large sets of data to determine \nwhether institution- and system-wide literacy and numeracy standards are being met. Though tests like the \nEducation Quality and Accountability Office’s (EQAO) provincial assessment program have long been used at \nthe K-12 level, only a handful of Canadian postsecondary institutions use standardized tests to measure \nbasic cognitive skills. In Ontario, this most often occurs in the form of pre- and post-admission testing. \nThe Language of Learning Outcomes: Definitions and Assessments \nHigher Education Quality Council of Ontario 8  \nDepending on the program in which a student has enrolled, they may be required to demonstrate their \nliteracy or numeracy skills or, in the case of students whose first language is not English or French, to write a \nfluency test such TOEFL or IELTS. While 62% of Ontario colleges administer some form of post-admission \nwriting assessment (Fisher & Hoth, 2010), only one university requires an undergraduate post-admission \nEnglish proficiency exam (Dion & Maldonado, 2013). Exit testing at both universities and colleges is even less \ncommon (Fisher & Hoth, 2010).  \nStandardized testing is more deeply entrenched in the American education system than it is in Canada. In \naddition to well-known assessments such as the SAT, ACT and GRE, new measures have been developed \nwith the learning outcomes approach in mind. In particular, the growing interest in measuring institutional \naccountability or ‘value-added’ is reflected in the Voluntary System of Accountability (VSA) program and its \nassociated measures, including the Collegiate Learning Assessment (CLA+), the ETS Proficiency Profile and \nthe College Assessment of Academic Proficiency (CAAP) (VSA, 2008; Liu, 2009; ACT, 2014b; Council for Aid to \nEducation, 2014; ETS, 2014a).  \nTraditionally, American colleges have used standardized tests like the SAT, ACT and GRE to measure the \nbasic cognitive skills of applicants. Tests are usually made up of multiple-choice mathematics, vocabulary \nand reading comprehension components, with an open-ended essay question used to evaluate writing skills \n(ACT, 2014a; College Board, 2014; ETS, 2014b). These tests have been used as educational benchmarks and \nhigh scores are considered to indicate that a student has the appropriate literacy and numeracy skills to \nenter PSE. However, the comparability and validity of outcomes data obtained through standardized testing \nis often contested, and a national debate has emerged in recent years about the impact of America’s high-\nstakes testing culture on educational outcomes. Both the SAT and ACT will launch updated versions with \nnew indicators in 2016, which are intended to capture the skills of incoming college students more \naccurately (ACT, 2014c; Ryan, 2014). \nWhen it comes to assessing literacy and numeracy at the postsecondary level, American colleges have \nseveral options available to them. Most of these standardized measures are similar in format to the SAT and \nACT, though with lower stakes. The College BASE test includes both essay and multiple-choice questions to \nevaluate students’ literacy and numeracy outcomes (University of Missouri Assessment Resource Center, \nn.d.). The ETS Proficiency Profile and the ACT function similarly, though institutions can choose whether or \nnot to include the essay component (VSA, 2008; ACT, 2014a; ETS, 2014a). Other mixed-format tests include \nthe CAAP and the National Assessment of Adult Literacy (NAAL) (VSA, 2008; Cutilli, 2009; ACT, 2014b; U.S. \nDepartment of Education, n.d.-a). Available reporting features can influence an institution’s choice of test, \ndepending on whether outcomes are being measured at the individual, institutional or international level, \nand depending on whether the data will be used to assess personal proficiency or to inform institutional \nchange. As we have mentioned, however, there is no systematic postsecondary assessment program for \nbasic cognitive outcomes, and institutions are free to choose whether or not to administer such a \nmeasurement in the first place. \nInternational assessments, such as the OECD’s Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) and \nProgramme for the International Assessment of Adult Competencies (PIAAC), help to make up for some of \nthe inconsistencies present in outcomes assessment at the institution level. PISA and PIAAC generate \nmassive data sets through common indicators, such that the information collected can be used to evaluate \nthe health of education systems and inform policy directions. These assessment programs are motivated in \npart by the evidence linking basic cognitive proficiency to improved economic standing, as well as the “need \nThe Language of Learning Outcomes: Definitions and Assessments \nHigher Education Quality Council of Ontario 9  \nto align higher education outcomes in key areas across borders in a time of growing graduate mobility” \n(Ewell, 2012, p. 37).  \nInternational assessments face challenges with regard to the relevance of the tests to participants and the \nusefulness of the data collected. Since international assessment data are intended for high-level analysis and \nplanning, individual scores are not normally made available to participants. It is also difficult to measure and \ncompare student outcomes across regions that do not necessarily have the same educational and \ntechnological infrastructure. Even given these methodological concerns, international assessments reliably \nproduce one important effect: with every reporting cycle, these measurements return literacy and \nnumeracy to the forefront of the national conversation about education. \n1.3 Summary \nStrong literacy and numeracy skills have been linked to many positive outcomes in life, including increased \nwages and labour market participation. Despite this, more work needs to be done at the postsecondary level \nto conceptualize literacy and numeracy as skills in their own right rather than as ‘background’ skills required \nfor higher-level disciplinary work. This lack of focus is facilitated by the unclear position allocated to basic \ncognitive skills in policy frameworks.  \nThose who do wish to assess basic cognitive skills at the postsecondary level will find a number of reliable \ntools at their disposal, especially for the assessment of students entering a course of study. Fewer tools are \navailable to measure the value-added of a postsecondary education.  \n2. Discipline-specific Learning Outcomes \nBasic cognitive learning outcomes address the skills students need in order to process complex information \nand develop specialized skills. This learning, which has traditionally been the focus of PSE, can be broken \ndown further into a range of discipline-specific learning outcomes. Discipline-specific outcomes determine \nwhether or not a student has acquired the particular abilities required for success in their chosen field of \nstudy. Although many discipline-specific outcomes have long histories, there is still much debate about how \nthey should be assessed. \nDiscipline-specific learning outcomes are stated most explicitly in professional programs, such as \nengineering and medicine, where accreditation standards exist and mirror these outcomes (Tamburri, 2013). \nThis type of outcome also surfaces in non-professional programs that clearly align with specific careers or \nsectors. In these instances, discipline-specific outcomes are often informed by jurisdictional accrediting \nbodies, partner institutions and/or program advisory committees representing relevant employers. The \narticulation of discipline-specific outcomes is common practice at the college level, where most programs of \ninstruction, professional or not, are tied to specific careers or industries. But it is also increasingly common \nin non-professional university programs, where discipline-specific outcomes are used to clarify program \nstructure and ensure educational quality.  \nWhile discipline-specific outcomes can improve the structure and coherence of a program, their external \nfunctions are not limited to defining career pathways. With the increase in international student mobility, \ninstitutions are placing greater emphasis on credit transfer. Discipline-specific outcomes have emerged as a \nThe Language of Learning Outcomes: Definitions and Assessments \nHigher Education Quality Council of Ontario 10  \nmeans of recognizing learning across jurisdictions, and as North American institutions look to attract foreign \nstudents, many colleges and universities have adopted discipline-specific learning outcomes as a means of \nremaining competitive with the world’s leading institutions (Tamburri, 2013, Feb. 6). The following sections \ncover some of the processes used to articulate and assess discipline-specific learning outcomes. \n2.1 The Tuning Process \nIn many ways, Europe’s Tuning process has served as the catalyst for the international interest in discipline-\nspecific outcomes. This initiative emerged in the wake of the Bologna Accord in 1999 as a means of ensuring \nthe mobility of credentials and the consistency of quality standards across EU countries. Learning outcomes \ndeveloped by the Tuning process can be mapped through all levels of a program or credential, ensuring \nalignment, accountability and clear direction for curriculum development (Lennon et al., 2014; Tuning USA, \n2014). The Tuning process, which involves gathering advice from subject matter and policy experts, has since \nbeen exported successfully to postsecondary systems in Latin America (2005), the United States (2009), \nRussia (2011), Africa (2011), Australia (pilot study 2010) and Canada (2011) (Institute for Evidence-Based \nChange, 2012; Yopp & Marshall, 2014). \nAlthough these Tuning projects have similar purposes – to define what a student should know and be able to \ndo upon completion of a postsecondary program in a given field – the approach to developing learning \noutcomes and the level of specificity of these outcomes varies in each context. While the Tuning process in \nOntario, which was coordinated by HEQCO, created general learning outcomes that suited a range of sectors \nand disciplines, the LTAS project in Australia tailored learning outcomes to each discipline (Australian \nLearning & Teaching Council, 2011; Lennon et al., 2014). In addition, the reasons for launching a Tuning \nprocess vary across jurisdictions. The European Tuning process was driven by the need for credentials that \nwould be recognized across national borders, while demands for institutional accountability and clear \neducational objectives motivated the process in Latin America (Beneitone et al., 2007; González & \nWagenaar, 2008; IEBC, 2012).  \n2.2 Assessment and Quality Assurance \nPostsecondary institutions have developed a variety of means of assessing discipline-specific learning \noutcomes, due in part to increased emphasis on quality assurance and institutional accountability (Brawley \net al., 2012). Instructors use tests, assignment rubrics, checklists and observation, among other tools, to \nassess discipline-specific skills across a broad range of fields (Heiland & Rosenthal, 2011). These tools are \nparticularly suited to formative learning as they can help students identify their weak spots in relation to the \nprogram outcomes, making it easier to formulate improvement strategies. \nBrawley et al. (2012) describe a three-step process for assessing discipline-specific learning outcomes: \n1. Identify the outcomes for a specific discipline or program of study \n2. Evaluate the program’s delivery of the intended learning outcomes (quality assurance) \n3. Utilize the results from the evaluation to improve the program’s ability to meet the standards \nset out by the learning outcomes (quality improvement) \nThe Language of Learning Outcomes: Definitions and Assessments \nHigher Education Quality Council of Ontario 11  \nIdeally, assessment involves both a quality assurance and a student improvement dimension. As mentioned \nabove, discipline-specific outcomes in professional programs are assessed regularly by accrediting bodies \n(Tamburri, 2013). Although accreditors have traditionally been concerned with improving curricula and \npedagogy, there has been a recent shift towards using quality assurance frameworks to ensure that \nprofessional standards are being met (Ewell, 2009). External stakeholders and employers in particular want \nevidence that graduates are equipped to join their respective professions. Regular assessment programs for \ndiscipline-specific learning outcomes can help to maintain stakeholder confidence in the quality of \nprofessional training programs. \nValue-added assessments such as the CLA+ or VSA, which calculate the difference between students’ \nexpected performance and actual performance, can be used for quality assurance if faculty and \nadministrators respond to apparent areas of weakness and/or promising practices. Similarly, in-class \nassessments can be used for both summative and formative purposes, providing instructors with an idea of \nstudents’ skill levels while using those findings to guide lesson content (Ewell, 2009). However, quality \nassurance exercises do not necessarily coincide with student improvement unless deliberate efforts are \nmade to ‘close the loop’ by adjusting teaching and learning strategies in response to assessment results.  \n2.3 Assessment and Student Achievement \nWhile there is growing consensus about the value of assessing students’ skills, there is considerable debate \nabout whether some skills can or should be assessed in discipline-free contexts, leading scholars to ask \nwhether every learning outcome should be viewed as a discipline-specific outcome.  \nLearning outcomes are meant to describe student performance. Proponents of discipline-specific \nassessment are typically of the opinion that the context in which a student is meant to apply a skill is an \nintegral part of the skill itself. That is to say, in some cases, outcomes should be assessed in the same \ncontext in which a student develops them. This is because in highly discipline-specific programs, the \ndiscipline comes to serve as a frame of reference and knowledge base upon which students draw when \napplying certain skills. The frame of reference provides the standard for measuring the quality of a student’s \nperformance. Skills can be measured outside of discipline-specific contexts using generic standards, but such \nassessments may be more limited in their ability to capture students’ skill levels accurately (Brooks, 2011; \nHeiland & Rosenthal, 2011; Barrie, Hughes, Crisp & Bennison, 2014; Christodoulou, 2014).  \nFor this reason, it is not necessarily appropriate to employ generic skills assessments if student performance \non these assessments is contributing to course grades or other components that could negatively impact \ngraduation and eventual participation in a given profession. At the same time, it is not always practical to \nassess outcomes in discipline-specific contexts, particularly when assessments target very large populations. \nThis is why some of the programs measuring skill levels at the regional, national or global level employ \ngeneric assessments, like the PIAAC. The purpose of such assessments is to generalize about all \nundergraduates or all adults living in a region, and context-free measurements are used to ensure that the \ndata collected will be reasonably comparable. These types of assessments are typically formatted as \nstandardized tests, with components measuring students’ application of generic skills in everyday situations. \nFor the same reasons, individual results are not made available, so that an individual’s performance does \nnot negatively impact a student’s academic performance or career prospects.  \nThe Language of Learning Outcomes: Definitions and Assessments \nHigher Education Quality Council of Ontario 12  \nThe debate around assessing learning outcomes in discipline-specific contexts is far from over. Proponents \nof context-free assessment are often concerned, with good reason, that singular focus on discipline-specific \nlearning outcomes could come at the cost of students’ ability to transfer learning beyond the bounds of \ntheir areas of specialization (Benjamin et al., 2012). The present challenge for assessment, then, is to strike \nan appropriate balance between discipline-specific learning outcomes and the higher-order cognitive and \ntransferrable skills domains. \nThe International Assessment of Higher Education Learning Outcomes (AHELO) is a rare example of a large-\nscale assessment that takes the significance of discipline-specific learning into account. In addition to \nassessing generic skills like literacy and numeracy, AHELO has piloted discipline-specific components for \nstudents in economics and engineering programs (OECD, 2014b). As AHELO’s pilots demonstrate, discipline-\nspecific assessments need not be restricted to content knowledge; rather, measurements can be \nconstructed that assess the application of knowledge to solve discipline-specific problems (Lennon & Jonker, \n2014).  \nThis is not to suggest that context-free assessments do not serve an important purpose. Generic \nassessments can provide data to inform employers of students’ skills, encourage institutional accountability \nand direct policy for postsecondary systems as a whole (Barrie, 2014). In addition to the CLA+ and the PIAAC, \nthere are many other instruments, such as the Australian Graduate Skills Assessment (GSA), which assess \nbasic cognitive and higher-order cognitive outcomes using a discipline-free approach (Australian Council for \nEducation Research, 2014). These tests provide much needed information but “very little is being written \nabout what tests of generic skills are actually measuring and with what accuracy” (Barrie, 2014). \n2.4 Summary \nTo the extent that they are mirrored in accreditation standards, discipline-specific learning outcomes create \nclear pathways from PSE to the labour market in professional disciplines. Through initiatives such as the \nTuning process, many institutions are using discipline-specific outcomes to provide quality assurance, \nimprove student mobility and smooth transitions into the workforce. The unique structure of discipline-\nspecific outcomes raises questions for assessment with regard to whether quality assurance and student \nachievement can be measured at the same time and whether it is appropriate to assess discipline-specific \noutcomes in a generic context. However, the long history of discipline-specific learning outcomes as a clear \nfocus of postsecondary institutions allows them to benefit from a level of clarity that the other categories of \nlearning outcomes, including higher-order cognitive outcomes, are not afforded. \n3. Higher-order Cognitive Outcomes \nHigher-order cognitive skills include critical thinking, problem solving and communication (Weingarten, \n2014, Feb. 13). Employers have been vocal about the need to teach students how to analyze complex \ninformation, make credible judgments and arrive at effective solutions; these abilities are highly valued in \nalmost every line of work (Benjamin et al., 2013; CCEO, 2013; Borwein, 2014). In PSE, the drive to advance \nhigher-order cognitive outcomes comes from professional and less career-specific programs alike. Highly \ndiscipline-specific programs such as engineering recognize the need for future professionals to be able to \nmake sound, responsible decisions, while general arts and science programs view higher-cognitive outcomes \nas skills that can help graduates transition into a variety of careers (WNS, 2009; Kaupp, Frank & Chen, 2014). \nThe Language of Learning Outcomes: Definitions and Assessments \nHigher Education Quality Council of Ontario 13  \nAlthough the learning outcomes approach helps educators and students identify and develop higher-order \ncognitive skills, critical thinking, problem solving and communication are often considered to be among the \nmost difficult outcomes to define, teach and assess. \n3.1 Defining Higher-order Cognitive Outcomes \nMost credential frameworks and degree profiles ascribe great importance to higher-order cognitive \noutcomes. However, at present, there is no standard way of framing them. We can take critical thinking, one \nof the most often discussed yet also one of the most ephemeral of higher-order cognitive outcomes, as an \nexample here. The COU’s Degree-Level Expectations embed critical thinking across a number of categories, \nwhile the Lumina Foundation and the LEAP Initiative both group it under the banner of ‘intellectual skills’ \n(National Leadership Council for Liberal Education & America’s Promise, 2007; COU, 2011; Lumina \nFoundation, 2011). Though Lumina and LEAP share a general approach to describing ‘intellectual skills,’ they \nbreak this category down further into component parts. These examples point to a much broader trend in \nthe higher-order cognitive domain: stakeholders recognize the value of critical thinking, problem solving and \ncommunication skills, but there is no consensus on how to conceptualize them, much less how to assess \nthem. \nIn this sense, the challenge we face here is the opposite of the situation with respect to basic cognitive \noutcomes. Basic cognitive outcomes appear to be undervalued in PSE, though educators understand quite \nwell how to teach and assess literacy and numeracy skills. In contrast, higher-order cognitive outcomes are \nhighly valued, but we lack agreement on definitions. Both sets of circumstances produce similar effects: \ninstitutions respond to these gray areas by developing their own concepts and interventions for assessment, \nbut these are difficult to translate across contexts, which in turn can affect the quality and cohesion of PSE \nwithin the sector as a whole.  \nAlthough we identify critical thinking, problem solving and communication skills as distinct higher-order \noutcomes, the differences between them are unclear. For example, as we noted earlier, literacy as a basic \ncognitive skill and communication as a higher-order skill can be challenging to differentiate. Critical thinking, \nmeanwhile, is difficult to define clearly and to link to demonstrable behaviours. One option has therefore \nbeen to understand problem solving and communication skills as components of critical thinking, as tools \none uses to resolve situations or convince others that one’s argument is sound (Benjamin, 2013). This \nargument has failed to convince everyone, however, and critical thinking remains a vague concept. This \nmakes it difficult to use in learning outcomes assessments and frameworks, because institutions and \nprograms interpret it a number of different ways. Since one goal of the learning outcomes approach is to \ncreate a common language of skills and abilities linked to demonstrable outcomes, critical thinking and \nother higher-order cognitive skills pose a particular challenge. \n3.2 Assessing Higher-order Cognitive Outcomes in PSE \nA number of measurements approach higher-order cognitive outcomes through problem solving and \ncommunication skills, since the definition of critical thinking is much disputed. The CLA+, for instance, \ncalculates critical thinking scores based on the quality of analytic reasoning, problem solving and \ncommunication skills reflected in participants’ written responses to case-based tasks (Benjamin, 2013). Even \nso, others have contested that this holistic approach fails to account for other components of critical \nThe Language of Learning Outcomes: Definitions and Assessments \nHigher Education Quality Council of Ontario 14  \nthinking, such as informal logic (Possin, 2013, Feb. 21). For while critical thinking may remain a vague \nconcept, we do know that students can be taught component skills like analytic reading, dissecting \narguments, differentiating between deductive and inductive reasoning, and so forth. The challenge for \nassessment lies in striking the right balance between known factors and other less well-defined \ncomponents. \nHow then can communication and problem solving be assessed? The following discussion highlights some of \nthe better-established measures used in PSE. \n3.2.1 Taxonomies \nThe use of clear, consistent terminology when writing and implementing learning outcomes is essential to \nboth their effectiveness as instructional tools and their alignment within a course or program. For this \nreason, taxonomies such as Bloom’s and SOLO are popular ways of indicating hierarchies in skill \ndevelopment, progressing from basic to more sophisticated cognitive processes (Krathwohl, 2002; Potter & \nKustra, 2012). Taxonomies often recommend the use of specific verbs to sort outcomes by level of \ncomplexity, with some activities, such as listing or describing, operating at a lower level of skill than others, \nsuch as analyzing or evaluating. These allow for the creation of clear hierarchies of learning outcomes and \ncan help chart the progression of student learning through a course of study. \n3.2.2 Rubrics \nRubrics can provide students with detailed, formative feedback on the level of rigour displayed in their \ncompletion of a given assignment and make transparent the level of skill expected of students. Rubrics are \npopular tools for assessing outcomes of all kinds, including higher-order skills. However, as they rely \nprimarily on the judgement of instructors, rubrics can be time-consuming to design effectively and \nunreliable when applied to large classes or samples. Nevertheless, the Association of American Colleges & \nUniversities (AAC&U) VALUE Rubrics, developed as part of the AAC&U’s LEAP initiative, are gaining traction \nas useful measures of higher-order cognitive outcomes that can be tailored to reflect discipline-specific \nrequirements (AAC&U, 2014). \n3.2.3 The Collegiate Learning Assessment (CLA+) \nThe CLA+ uses open-ended, case-based written assessment tasks to measure how well students “formulate \nhypotheses, recognize fallacious reasoning, and identify implicit and possibly incorrect assumptions” \n(Benjamin, 2013, p. 3). In doing so, the CLA+ eschews the multiple-choice format usually preferred by \ncommercially available standardized tests because, according to the creators of the instrument, students do \nnot necessarily have to exercise their critical thinking capacities to choose between a set of possible answers \n(Benjamin, 2013). Instead, the CLA+’s open-ended format provides students with a short case study that \nmirrors complex, real-world problems. Since students are given all of the information they need to analyze \nthe case, and the tasks are presented in a variety of contexts, the CLA+ claims to measure the \ncommunication and problem solving skills regardless of discipline (Benjamin, 2013). \nHowever, it has been argued that the CLA+’s lack of discipline-specific context ignores the extent to which \nprior subject-area knowledge and problem-solving experience factor into a student’s critical thinking process \nThe Language of Learning Outcomes: Definitions and Assessments \nHigher Education Quality Council of Ontario 15  \n(Banta & Pike, 2012). This may cause students from some programs, especially those in which critical \nthinking is taught through simulations, case studies and problem-based learning, to underperform on what \nis primarily an exercise in close reading and written analysis. Additionally, others have suggested that the \nCLA+’s emphasis on a holistic conception of critical thinking overlooks the significance of informal logic and \ncritical thinking strategies (Possin, 2013, Feb. 21). This criticism is levelled primarily at the validity of the \nCLA+’s assessment scores rather than at the test itself, since the CLA+ implicitly includes these skill \ncomponents. The implication of this oversight, however, is significant: since components of critical thinking \nare not included in the scoring matrix, the CLA+ may be a better measure of rhetorical skills than of critical \nthinking proper. \n3.2.4 High-impact Practices and the Wabash National Study of Liberal Arts Education \nThe Wabash National Study of Liberal Arts Education (WNS) is a broad-based longitudinal study of liberal \narts outcomes, including critical thinking. The study launched in 2006 at Wabash College’s Centre of Inquiry \nin the Liberal Arts, with 19 participating institutions. Since then, the WNS has grown to include 49 \ninstitutions and over 170,000 postsecondary students. The WNS tracks sample cohorts at each institution for \nat least four years, with the intention of measuring learning outcomes in terms of student development \nrather than institutional goals (WNS, 2009). The WNS is notable for its efforts to understand how high-\nimpact teaching practices affect the development of specific outcomes and whether different student \ndemographics experience the effects of these strategies differently (Pascarella & Blaich, 2013). The study is \none of very few longitudinal outcomes assessment projects that offer rare insight into the development of \nhigher-order cognitive outcomes over time.  \nStudents are tested three times – in the fall and spring of their first year of study and in the spring of their \nfinal year. Student surveys are administered alongside several different standardized assessments to \nestablish benchmarks and rates of change. Assessment data are then triangulated with demographic, \ncourse, program and institutional information to create highly detailed data sets that, ideally, will be used to \ninform future policy and program directions (Blaich & Wise, 2011). \nGiven the richness of the data collected for the WNS, the results to date have been quite nuanced. This is \nespecially true of the findings related to high-impact practices. It comes as no surprise that high-quality \nteaching and deep learning experiences have been found to impact cognition positively in ways that may \nextend beyond academic performance. At the same time, the WNS data sets were found to contain \nnumerous conditional effects, particularly when results were broken down by race, gender, family income \nand pre-college ability. In some cases, practices that were linked to strong cognitive gains for one \ndemographic group generated no significant statistical difference for another. Interactional diversity – \nexposure to different social and cultural viewpoints – was the only high-impact practice to foster four-year \ngrowth in critical thinking in the overall WNS sample. However, the net gains related to this practice were \nalmost wholly accrued by white students, and white males in particular, with female students and African-\nAmerican students reporting a considerably weaker impact (Pascarella & Blaich, 2013). The prevalence of \ndemographic conditional effects in the first round of data underscores the fact that critical thinking skills \ndevelop in highly personal ways. This is among the WNS’s most valuable insights into the assessment of \nhigher-order cognitive outcomes.  \nThe Language of Learning Outcomes: Definitions and Assessments \nHigher Education Quality Council of Ontario 16  \n3.3 Summary \nCritical thinking is highly valued in PSE but notoriously difficult to capture in learning outcomes. Although we \nknow that it is closely linked to other higher-order cognitive skills, we do not yet have a strong \nunderstanding of how it operates. Yet critical thinking is widely cited in learning outcomes frameworks, \nwhich use varying definitions and leave much room for interpretation.  \nSince critical thinking is such a vague concept, we focus on those instruments that measure it indirectly \nthrough problem solving and communication skills. But as our discussions of the CLA+ and the Wabash \nNational Study illustrate, it is difficult to find assessment measures that allow students to draw upon their \ndisciplinary knowledge base and frames of reference. The WNS also demonstrates the extent to which \npersonal experiences affect critical thinking abilities. Since much of critical thinking occurs invisibly, without \nbeing linked to its own discrete and observable behaviours, problem solving, communication and analytical \nskills like informal logic still seem to be the most promising roads to access the teaching and assessment of \nhigher-order cognitive outcomes.  \n4. Transferrable Skills Outcomes \nTransferrable skills are “prime qualities that make and keep us employable” (Goleman, 1998, p. 4). These \noutcomes can help students succeed not only academically but professionally and personally as well \n(Weingarten, Feb. 13, 2014). ‘Transferrable’ reflects the fact that these skills are thought to be generic and \napplicable across a range of activities, though transfer is not necessarily automatic and adaptation may be \nrequired (Jackson, 2013). Students need to understand how and when transferrable skills can be used to \ntheir advantage, both within their fields of study and on the labour market. \n4.1 The Transfer Process \nStakeholders sometimes equate transferrable skills with graduate employability, which presupposes that the \ngeneric nature of such skills makes them valuable and applicable in any professional context. However, \nsome researchers argue that this equation neglects to take learning transfer into account as a distinct stage \nin the skill development process (Cameron et al., 2011; Jackson, 2013). Many of the key premises of learning \ntransfer can be used to illuminate the nature of transferrable skills and learning outcomes. Specifically, \nquestions of metacognition – how and why we think and act the ways we do – can help explain the ‘how’ \nand ‘when’ of learning and skill transfer.  \nMetacognition refers to “the mind’s ability to reflect on how effectively it is handling the learning process” \n(Conley, 2013, Jan. 22), the ability to “stop and think” or “step back and reflect” (Behar-Horenstein & Niu, \n2011). These descriptions position metacognition at the heart of the higher-order cognitive processes. Our \nproblem solving and communication activities are functions of our ability to think critically and ask questions \n– that is, our capacity for metacognition. But metacognition is also central to transferrable skills, which are \nessentially tools and techniques that we use to navigate between and engage with various situations \n(Conley, 2013, Jan. 22). Our ability to transfer learning is what sets the basic cognitive, discipline-specific and \nhigher-order cognitive domains in motion. \nThe Language of Learning Outcomes: Definitions and Assessments \nHigher Education Quality Council of Ontario 17  \nTransferrable skills help us to leverage our learning and frames of reference to apply our skills in unfamiliar \ncontexts. When employers look for flexibility, resourcefulness and adaptability, they are naming \ntransferrable outcomes that can ease the transition from school to work. Yet these qualities are far from \nsimple to teach and assess. Transferrable outcomes depend as much on personality as on curriculum. Just as \nsome students might display a knack for mathematics while others might require additional supports, some \nstudents are inclined to work well in teams while others need to develop this skill.  \nMuch of the current research on learning transfer employs case studies and problem-based learning \nactivities to allow students to test their skills and judgment in different environments (Jackson, 2013). Such \nactivities teach students to identify ‘situational cues’ that trigger memories of related learning experiences. \nThrough practice, immersion and repetition, students are encouraged to draw upon previous knowledge \nand experience when making decisions or choosing courses of action in new situations. These exercises are \ncommonly used in discipline-specific programs like medicine and engineering, where professional standards \ngovern performance and where the margin of error on the job is small.  \nGiven the challenge of teaching and assessing transferrable skills outcomes in PSE and the lack of rigorous \nresearch on how these outcomes can be met, we turn to qualities that are thought to be strong indicators of \neventual skill transfer and effective transferrable skills outcomes: creativity and grit.  \n4.2 Creativity \nCreativity is the ability or tendency to look for innovative or unconventional relations between things or \nconcepts. This eye for the novel may be an indicator of skill transfer, in that it could help students gain the \nflexibility needed to apply their knowledge and skills to unfamiliar situations. There is thus growing interest \nin using creativity, rather than intelligence quotient (IQ), as an indicator of intellectual potential (Bronson & \nMerryman, 2014, Jan. 23). \nThe Torrance Test of Creative Thinking (TTCT) has done much to stimulate this area of study. For more than \n50 years, the TTCT has been the subject of a longitudinal study on creativity and intelligence. The study \nreports a strong positive correlation between high TTCT scores and achievement in high school, peer \nnomination and creative activities (Runco et al., 2010). Although personal experiences and motivation do \ninfluence TTCT outcomes, the findings have been reasonably consistent throughout the course of the study, \nwith the most recent analyses (2010) reporting a statistically significant trend linking personal achievement \nand creativity. \nThe TTCT study findings are not alone in linking creativity to improved educational outcomes. As advocates \nof problem-based learning and open-ended performance tasks report, there are opportunities for “deep \nlearning” wherever students are encouraged to work across different points of view (American Institutes for \nResearch, 2014; Hoidn & Kärkkäinen, 2014; Kaupp, Frank & Chen, 2014). In fact, teaching and assessment \nstrategies that encourage students to use their imagination and think from others’ perspectives are \nexcellent means of developing transferrable and higher-order cognitive outcomes. Not only does critical \nthinking inherently involve a sort of feedback loop with imagination, but the ability to consider others’ \nperspectives is important for transferrable skills like good citizenship, flexibility and teamwork (Pascarella & \nBlaich, 2013). Creativity can be viewed as the ‘motive power’ that animates and exercises these skills.  \nThe Language of Learning Outcomes: Definitions and Assessments \nHigher Education Quality Council of Ontario 18  \nThe learning outcomes approach has not yet managed to translate psychological research on creativity into \na viable approach to this skill for PSE, though strong interest exists in doing so. While researchers have \ndeveloped measures of creativity like the TTCT, it is not clear if it is appropriate or effective to apply clinical \nassessments to educational settings. Additionally, questions remain as to how fair it is to hold institutions \naccountable for creativity outcomes. While there is much work to be done in this area, we can at the very \nleast recognize the role creativity plays in developing transferrable skills outcomes and use this knowledge \nto advance our assessment resources. \n4.3 Resilience and Emotional Intelligence \nCreativity is only one quality underlying successful skill transfer and the development of transferrable skills. \nIn recent years, there has been increased interest in applying psychological research on resilience, or “the \ncapacity of the person, family, or community to prevent, minimize, overcome, or thrive in spite of negative \nor challenging circumstances,” to the learning outcomes approach (Wagnild & Young, 1993). Resilience is \nalso sometimes referred to as ‘grit,’ though the working definition of grit used by researchers in the field like \nDuckworth only describes one narrow aspect of how resilience operates (Duckworth et al., 2007). \nNearly all of the research on resilience has focused on measuring and developing it in early childhood or for \nmembers of at-risk or marginalized groups. Little work has been done on how resilience can be taught and \nassessed in the general postsecondary student or adult population because resilience only emerges in \nrelation to risk. Even then, the grit a person might display in response to the situation will be composed of a \nnumber of often idiosyncratic factors, which can vary each time person is called to display resilience \n(Gardner et al., 2010; Prince-Embury, 2013). \nNevertheless, the so-called ‘grit factor’ has proven to be an attractive concept to parents and educators \nalike. A student’s willingness to put time and effort into meeting challenges and solving problems has been \nshown to have an impact on their eventual success in PSE. When risks and goals are clear, as in competitive \ncontexts like the Scripps National Spelling Bee or like military training, resilience can be measured by \npersistence and motivation (Duckworth et al., 2007; Eskreis-Winkler et al., 2014).  \nStill, the concept of grit has its limits. Some educators and policy experts have criticized the focus on \nresilience for minimizing the effect that students’ circumstances have on their learning (Tough, 2013). By \nperpetuating what is in effect a recasting of Weber’s “Protestant work ethic” or the virtues of “pulling \noneself up by the bootstraps,” those wishing to integrate resilience into pedagogical practice need to be \naware of the vast bodies of research showing that at-risk students also tend to benefit from remedial \ninterventions and personalized approaches to education, particularly at the postsecondary level (Socol, \n2013; Tough, 2013; Lichtman, 2014; Socol, 2014; Thomas, 2014; Warner, 2014). We should not assume that \n‘sticking to it’ is always enough to achieve an objective or neglect the mitigating role that personal \ncircumstances can play, but there is always room for improvement. Just as some people are better runners \nthan others, virtually anyone can, with training and support, work up to a level of fitness that improves or \nsustains their health and endurance.  \nAt present, the PSE sector has no systematic approach to resilience. Those institutions that do assess \nresilience outcomes typically do so in a counselling or advisory services setting, and only for members of at-\nrisk or underrepresented groups who access their supports. This means that unlike critical thinking, for \nThe Language of Learning Outcomes: Definitions and Assessments \nHigher Education Quality Council of Ontario 19  \nwhich we have both established teaching strategies and large-scale assessment tools like the CLA+, \nresilience has yet to be studied and assessed in classrooms at the level of the average postsecondary \nstudent’s educational experience. Resilience presents additional problems for assessment insofar as it is not \nonly demonstrated in response to risk, but also over long periods of time. This means that performance \ntasks like the Academic Diligence Task, which measures individual differences in diligence on tedious but \nimportant work (Galla et al., 2014), miss the point somewhat – our understanding of resilience has \nexpanded considerably beyond historical descriptions of ‘toughing it out’ and ‘bouncing back” in the face of \nadversity. Though we have a large body of psychological research and psychometric measurements, we \nneed to determine whether these tools can be adapted for use outside of counselling and advisory services \n(Windle, Bennett & Noyes, 2011).  \n4.4 Summary \nThe postsecondary sector has yet to demonstrate interest in developing and assessing transferrable skills \noutcomes (Weingarten, Feb. 13, 2014). Still, these skills are just as valuable to postsecondary students as \nthey are to early learners, and pre-school and school readiness programs in Canada have long used \nmeasures such as the Early Development Index to help children with diverse needs successfully transition to \nkindergarten. Ontario’s K-12 sector is also beginning to recognize the importance of transferrable skills for \nstudent success: in February 2014, People for Education launched the Measuring what Matters project, a \nmulti-year initiative developing educational outcomes for creativity, citizenship, health, quality learning \nenvironments and social-emotional skills (People for Education, 2014). As such, PSE may be able to expand \non the work of the early childhood and K-12 education sectors to develop and assess transferrable skills \noutcomes.  \nBasic cognitive and disciplinary outcomes allow students to navigate the world, while higher-order cognitive \noutcomes allow them to engage it critically. Transferrable skills outcomes, however, transcend language and \ndiscipline. These capacities help us adapt our learning to different situations and thus carry it from the \nclassroom to the labour market and beyond. While we know little about how to teach and assess \ntransferrable skills at the postsecondary level, we understand some of the underlying phenomena – learning \ntransfer, creativity and resilience. We also know that we begin developing these skills early in life, so we can \nlook to the ways transferrable outcomes are assessed in early learning, elementary school and secondary \nschool as we develop measures that are appropriate for PSE. \n5. Concluding Remarks \nPostsecondary education has reached a critical impasse. Structurally speaking, the Canadian system does \nnot look much different than it did 50 years ago. But the system’s dynamics have changed considerably: \nreduced government funding and the tough economic climate make efficient financial models a necessity \nfor healthy institutions; student debt loads are increasing and yet clear pathways from school to work are \nfar from the norm; and the student body is increasingly diverse, with growing numbers of international \nstudents, students from historically underrepresented groups, mature students returning to PSE to improve \ncareer prospects, and students having to work at least part-time to manage the cost of education. To ensure \nthat our system is accountable, accessible and of the highest quality, we need to define and assess the \noutcomes of education at the institutional and student levels. \nThe Language of Learning Outcomes: Definitions and Assessments \nHigher Education Quality Council of Ontario 20  \nHEQCO’s primary contribution to this goal thus far has been to propose a typology including four different \nclasses of postsecondary learning outcome appropriate to the Ontario context: basic cognitive skills, \ndiscipline-specific skills, higher-order cognitive skills and transferrable skills. Together, these categories can \nbe used to guide postsecondary outcomes assessment and, in doing so, create a shared foundation for \npostsecondary learning quality. This report has demonstrated, however, that the definition and assessment \nof learning outcomes within these four categories is not without its complications. For example, while \nliteracy and numeracy have widely been acknowledged as basic cognitive skills linked to positive outcomes \nlater in life, including increased wages and labour market participation, the postsecondary sector has often \nviewed them as a prerequisite for PSE rather than a group of skills to be developed in PSE. More work needs \nto be done to conceptualize literacy and numeracy as skills in their own right rather than as ‘background’ \nskills required for higher-level disciplinary work at the postsecondary level. This lack of focus is facilitated by \nthe unclear situation of literacy and numeracy in the various provincial qualifications frameworks.  \nDiscipline-specific skills face the opposite problem. Disciplinary knowledge has long been the focus of a \npostsecondary education, often to the exclusion of any other type of skills. The challenge here lies in \nassessing discipline-specific skills in a manner that gives them their due but also strikes a balance with other \ntypes of skills. A debate also rages about whether discipline-specific skills can be assessed in non-disciplinary \ncontexts. Overall, however, discipline-specific skills possess a lengthy history and thus a level of clarity from \nwhich the other categories of learning outcomes do not benefit. \nThe conceptualization of higher-order cognitive skills requires that we determine where basic cognitive skills \nend and more advanced skills begin. Higher-order cognitive skills can be particularly difficult to capture in \nlearning outcomes as they often are not linked to discrete, observable behaviours and thus are difficult to \nassess. The general emphasis on these outcomes in PSE, however, has led to the creation of a wide range of \ndefinitions and in turn a variety of assessment tools based on these different definitions. The vagueness of \nthese skills thus makes for especially murky waters. A common resolution has been to break higher-order \ncognitive skills into its component parts – viewing critical thinking as made up of communications and \nproblem solving skills, for example – and focusing assessment on these components instead.  \nFinally, transferable skills outcomes have long been assessed in early childhood education but have yet to \nbecome common in the learning outcomes discussion at the postsecondary level. Their importance is \nobvious, however, as they allow students to apply their skills in a variety of contexts, thus easing the \ntransition both into and out of PSE. While we know little about how to teach and assess transferrable skills \nat the postsecondary level, we understand some of the underlying phenomena – learning transfer, creativity \nand resilience – and we can look to outcomes assessments used in early life for inspiration in PSE. \nIf implemented properly the learning outcomes approach can serve the purposes both of accountability and \nquality measurement. However, it is not enough to revise policy infrastructure and map outcomes across \ncredentials. In order for a system to be truly outcomes-based, we need to prove that students are \ngraduating with the skills they need to succeed. Assessment remains the keystone of the learning outcomes \napproach at the postsecondary level, though it is not always taken seriously. If given proper consideration, \nlearning outcomes assessment could be an invaluable source of strength and flexibility for a system in \ntransition. \nThe Language of Learning Outcomes: Definitions and Assessments \nHigher Education Quality Council of Ontario 21  \nReferences \nACT (2014a).

In this manner the \nUniversity demonstrates its commitment to \nimproving the representativeness of its \ncommunities. \nThe Alberta Human Rights \nAct, sections 3 and 11.1, requires that no \nindividual be discriminated against on the \nbasis of race, religious beliefs, color, \ngender, physical disability, mental disability, \nmarital status, age, ancestry, or place of \norigin, family status, or source of income \nexcept where the discrimination can be \nshown to be reasonable and justifiable.

The University \nrecognizes the diversity of the Canadian \npopulation and obligation to be accessible to all \nsectors of society. The University therefore \nencourages diversity in applications by \nwelcoming all qualified people including \nwomen, First Nations Metis and Inuit, persons \nwith disabilities, people from diverse socio-\neconomic backgrounds, and members of \nvisible/racialized, sexual and gender minority \ncommunities. The University Calendar will use \ngender inclusive language when referring to \nmembers of the University Community. In this \nmanner the University demonstrates its \ncommitment to accommodating and improving \nthe representativeness of \nits diverse communities. \nThe Alberta Human Rights Act, prohibits \ndiscrimination against any person because \nof race, religious beliefs, colour, gender identity, \ngender expression, physical disability, mental \ndisability, ancestry, place of origin, marital \nstatus, source of income, family status or \nsexual orientation, except where the distinction \ncan be shown to be a bona fide requirement or \na bona fide occupational requirement.
