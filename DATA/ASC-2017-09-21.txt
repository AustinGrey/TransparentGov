Discussion: The Chair led members through an initial discussion of a number of items within the committee’s current terms of reference and whether there would be advantages to moving some to the Committee on the Learning Environment. Ms Brolley provided a brief overview of the mandate of the (CLE): teaching, learning, and the learning environment. Members expressed concern about moving items to CLE which have a regulatory focus, that not all Faculties are represented at CLE, and that members deal with many of the questions related to these items on a regular basis. Members also noted that evaluation and grading are part of teaching and learning, and that there is scholarship around assessment. Members also discussed how the two committees could work together on items of joint concern and whether one committee could provide a recommendation to the other on such items. The Chair noted that the work and mandate of ASC and CLE are intertwined and used the recent example of proposed changes the calendar section around course outlines. On the issue of the Alberta Transfer Guide, the Chair reported that work on transfers is an ongoing endeavour at the university, as well at the Ministry of Advanced Education. The Chair noted that the discussion surrounding transfers would be paused pending certain key directions by ACAT. Members discussed why consolidated examinations fall under GFC’s purview as it appears to be primarily operational. Ms Brolley pointed out the current UAPPOL procedures in place which point to the GFC Executive Committee for oversight. She also noted that consolidated examinations impact students. The Chair, noting time constraints, ended the discussion but noted that the item would be brought back for further deliberation.",

It is important to \nrecognize that committee orientation must be designed in light of the \nfact that those at-large members who do not sit on GFC may require \nadditional attention. The ad hoc committee recommends that \nItem No. 4 \nGFC ACADEMIC STANDARDS COMMITTEE \nFor the Meeting of September 6, 2017 \norientation and orientation materials should be provided in a number \nof modes and formats, including stand-alone orientation workshops, \nbriefings at meetings, and through widely available written and online \nmaterials. A GFC member handbook or guidebook would be an ideal \nreference tool. In light of the unique character of collegial academic \ngovernance, GFC members should be encouraged to use orientation \nsessions to meet and get to know their fellow members and create \nnetworks which can provide informal support and community building \nopportunities. The following recommendations focus on improving \norientation to prepare GFC and committee members to be informed \nand active participants in academic governance. \nRecommendation: THAT a variety of orientation sessions be offered \nincluding a general orientation to governance (Governance 101), \nfollowed by orientations more specific to GFC and GFC standing \ncommittees, and follow up sessions through the year \nRecommendation: THAT the responsibilities of members be clearly \noutlined in a core GFC document” \nCompliance with Legislation, \nPolicy and/or Procedure \nRelevant to the Proposal \n(please quote legislation and \ninclude identifying section \nnumbers) \n1.

Current Committee Terms of Reference \nPrepared by: University Governance \n1 of 2 \nGENERAL FACULTIES COUNCIL \nPrinciples of Delegation \nPrinciples for General Faculties Council Delegation of Authority \nIntroduction \nGovernance is understood as the process through which an organization defines and achieves \nits mandate, which includes making decisions with regard to the structures, policies, and \npractices of decision-making; the exercise of authority; and the mechanisms of accountability.  \nGeneral Faculties Council (GFC) has employed a structure that relies upon the delegation of its \nprovincially-mandated authorities to its standing committees, individuals on campus and other \ncampus bodies.  Delegation is essential to ensure timely and efficient decision-making in \nsmaller forums with access to appropriate resource people, while allowing GFC to focus on \nsubstantive and strategic issues of broad relevance to the university community.  The following \noffers guidance to this delegation structure and helps maintain accountability, transparency, and \ncollegiality in the academic governance system at the University of Alberta. \nRetained Authority \nGeneral Faculties Council shall pursue major policy and strategic issues that include: \n● significant strategic and policy issues related to the academic affairs of the university;\n● any matter involving the alteration of the mandate, terms of reference, membership, or\nstructure of a GFC standing committee; and\n● those matters that a standing committee, body, or officer holding delegated authority\nfrom GFC considers to be of major strategic significance or long-term impact on the\nuniversity.\nPrinciples \n1. Delegations of authority must be reasonable in scope and appropriate to the character and\ncapacity of the body (e.g. council or committee) or officer receiving the delegated authority. \n2. An officer or body acting with delegated authority is accountable to the body which\ndelegated the authority and must report to that body in a timely and sufficiently detailed\nfashion on actions taken under the delegated authority.\n3. An officer or body is responsible to be alert to situations where, for example, there is\nuncertainty as to whether an item falls within the intended delegation or the significance of\nan issue and the division of opinion on the issue suggest it is prudent to refer the issue or\ndecision to the delegating body for consideration. When there is uncertainty as to whether\nan item falls within the intended delegated authority, or if there is clear division of opinion,\nthe officer or body with delegated authority will refer the item to the body that delegated the\nauthority along with a recommendation.\n4. Delegations should be recorded in written form and curated in a transparent manner.\n2 of 2 \nGENERAL FACULTIES COUNCIL \nPrinciples of Delegation \n 5. A body delegating authority may impose restrictions on that authority -- including restrictions \non the authority to sub-delegate -- so long as the restrictions allow sufficient authority for the \ndelegation to be meaningful. \n6. All delegations of authority should be reviewed at regular intervals (ideally once every three \nyears) to ensure they remain appropriate. \n7. Withdrawal of delegated authority should be considered judiciously based on the best \ninterest of the institution and cannot be done retroactively. \n8. An officer or body is not compelled to exercise delegations. The fact that a delegation is held \ndoes not oblige the officer or body to exercise the delegation if, in the opinion of the \ndelegate, some special or unusual circumstances are involved which make it sensible that \nthe issue should receive consideration at a more senior level. \nApproved by General Faculties Council: April 21, 2017 \n1 of 1 \nGENERAL FACULTIES COUNCIL \nPrinciples of Committee Composition \nPrinciples for General Faculties Council Standing Committee Composition \nIntroduction \nGovernance at the University of Alberta relies upon a structure wherein the General Faculties \nCouncil has delegated many of its provincially-mandated authorities to its standing committees.  \nAs such, the composition of those standing committees is crucial to ensuring that decisions are \nmade in an informed manner that takes into account the breadth of issues, perspectives and \nopinions on campus.  The following principles provide a framework to create committee \ncompositions which are reflective of the membership of GFC and appropriate to the role and \nmandate of those committees.  \nPrinciples \n1. Wherever possible, the majority of elected members of each standing committee should be\ndrawn from the membership of GFC to provide tangible links between GFC and its standing\ncommittees and increase engagement of the greater GFC community.\n2. Wherever possible, the number of elected members of a standing committee should exceed\nthe number of ex-officio members.\n3. The voting status of ex-officio members of standing committees should be consistent with\ntheir voting status on GFC and should extend to their delegates.\n4. Ex-officio members should be included in the membership of a standing committee only\nwhen their portfolio is directly relevant to the mandate and role of the standing committee.\n5. Wherever possible, the Vice-Chair of a standing committee should be elected by the\ncommittee from its elected academic staff members and ideally be a member of GFC.\n6. Standing Committees should be populated with a commitment to diversity and broad\nrepresentation from across the university.\n7. When cross-appointment of members on standing committees is appropriate, this should be\noutlined in the terms of reference of each committee and such members shall have voting\nstatus on both committees.\nApproved by General Faculties Council: April 21, 2017 \n1 of 2 \nGENERAL FACULTIES COUNCIL \nRoles and Responsibilities of Members \nRoles and Responsibilities of Members \nIntroduction \nGeneral Faculties Council (GFC) is the principal academic decision-making body of the \nuniversity. It is established in the Post-Secondary Learning Act (PSLA) and given authority, \nsubject to the Board of Governors, over the academic affairs of the university. \nFor GFC to be successful in fulfilling its terms of reference and meeting its responsibilities to the \nuniversity it depends on the active engagement of its members. GFC has delegated much of its \nauthority for routine matters to standing committees allowing GFC to engage in high level \nstrategic and stewardship policy issues. GFC members have the opportunity to serve on the \nstanding committees that approve matters with the delegated authority from GFC.  \nGFC operates under the principle of collegial academic governance including: \n• A commitment to inclusive and participatory governance decision-making\n• A desire to facilitate meaningful individual-level engagement in governance processes\n• A commitment to openness, transparency, and respectful communication\n• A commitment to responsiveness, respect, and reciprocity between governing bodies\nand between governing bodies and university administration\nRoles and Responsibilities of Members \n1. Understand GFC\n1.1 Members should understand that not all matters under GFC jurisdiction will come\nbefore that body for approval. Some decisions are made at the standing committee \nlevel as GFC has delegated authority to approve and report on actions taken on certain \nmatters.   \n1.2 The university operates in a bicameral governance system. Members should \nunderstand the distinction between the role and responsibilities of GFC and the Board \nof Governors. \n2. Meeting Attendance\n2.1 Members have a responsibility to attend GFC meetings.\na. If a student misses two consecutive meetings, or more than three meetings in one\nacademic year, the Students’ Union or the Graduate Students’ Association may\nrequest that the Chair declare the position vacant.\nb. If a Faculty representative or a non-student member misses two consecutive\nmeetings or more than three meetings in one academic year without a reason\nsatisfactory to the members of the GFC Executive Committee, the Executive\nCommittee shall declare the position vacant.\n2.2 Members have a responsibility to serve on GFC committees as appropriate and attend \ncommittee meetings. \na. If an elected member is absent from three consecutive meetings or is frequently\nabsent without a reason satisfactory to the remaining members of the committee, the \nChair shall declare the position vacant. \n2 of 2 \nGENERAL FACULTIES COUNCIL \nRoles and Responsibilities of Members \n2.3 Members should advise the GFC Secretary or committee coordinator if they are unable \nto attend a meeting. \n3.  Participate in GFC Business \n3.1 Members should prepare for meetings by reviewing agenda materials in advance that, \nfor open sessions, are publicly available at governance.ualberta.ca \n 3.2 Members should engage in candid and respectful discussion of matters which are \nbrought before GFC and its various bodies  \n3.3 When voting on motions: \na. Members must act in good faith with the view to the best interests of the university as \na whole. While members may be informed by matters raised by various \nconstituencies, it is the duty of a member to ensure that all constituencies are fairly \nconsidered in the process of decision making.  \nb. When notified of an e-vote, members should vote in a timely manner in order to \nensure that quorum requirements are met.  \n4.  Manage Conflict of Interest and Act Ethically \n4.1 Comply with the university’s policies and procedures regarding both ethical conduct and \nconflict of interest.  Members must declare conflicts when they arise.  \n4.2 Maintain confidentiality of all information included in closed session meetings.  \n5.  Ask Questions \n5.1 Information requests may be made of the University Governance office, should \nmembers require more information than is provided with the meeting agenda. \n5.2 If a member wishes to raise a question at GFC within the jurisdiction of the body, a \nquestion may be submitted in writing to the GFC Secretary up to six working days \nbefore the next GFC meeting to receive a written response. \n5.3 Every GFC meeting has Question Period as a standing item wherein members may \nraise a question during the time set aside for this item. Procedures for Question Period \nare available at governance.ualberta.ca \n5.4 If a member has a question with regard to an item on the agenda, it may be raised \nduring consideration of that item at the GFC meeting. \n5.5 If a member wishes to add an item to the agenda for debate, the member should \ncontact the Chair or GFC Secretary for assistance. \n6.  Communicate Information to Constituents \n6.1 Members should communicate with their Faculty or constituency regarding agenda \nitems coming before GFC.  \n6.2 Members should communicate with their Faculty or constituency on matters which were \ndiscussed/approved at GFC in Open Session. \nApproved at General Faculties Council:  April 21, 2017 \nhttp://www.governance.ualberta.ca/\nhttps://policiesonline.ualberta.ca/PoliciesProcedures/Policies/Ethical-Conduct-and-Safe-Disclosure-Policy.pdf\nhttps://policiesonline.ualberta.ca/PoliciesProcedures/Policies/Conflict-Policy--Conflict-of-Interest-and-Commitment-and-Institutional-Conflict.pdf\nhttp://www.governance.ualberta.ca/GeneralFacultiesCouncil/%7E/media/Governance/Documents/GO05/GEN/Linked%20Documents%20on%20GFC%20Home%20Page/Question-Period-Excerpt-from-the-2006-GFC-PM.pdf\nhttp://www.governance.ualberta.ca/GeneralFacultiesCouncil/%7E/media/Governance/Documents/GO05/GEN/Linked%20Documents%20on%20GFC%20Home%20Page/Question-Period-Excerpt-from-the-2006-GFC-PM.pdf\n1 of 6 \nGENERAL FACULTIES COUNCIL \nMeeting Procedural Rules  \nMeeting Procedural Rules \n Introduction \nGeneral Faculties Council (GFC) has on many occasions confirmed its commitment to having a \nset of rules that assist rather than impede the conduct of business. GFC rules are not meant to \nunduly restrict debate or limit opportunities for participation. Their purpose is to facilitate \ninclusive and respectful dialogue, while ensuring efficient decision-making. It is the responsibility \nof the Chair, with the support of GFC, to employ the rules governing general meetings in a \nmanner consistent with these principles. Substantive motions should be handled with \nconsiderable formality, but whenever possible the Chair should deal with matters of procedure \nby general agreement. \nThe following rules and procedures are based on a number of fundamental principles that \nencourage participation and engagement of members. These principles include: \n• A commitment to inclusive and participatory decision-making. \n• A commitment to openness, transparency and respectful communication. \n1.  Procedural Rules  \n1.1  GFC and its standing committees are governed by the procedural rules set out below. \nFor matters not covered by these rules, or by the Post Secondary Learning Act (PSLA) \nreference shall be made to the current edition of Robert's Rules of Order. If this does \nnot provide clear direction regarding a point in question, then the Chair shall decide \nhow to proceed. However, such rulings by the Chair may be overruled via a motion \nsupported by a vote of the majority of those present.  \n1.2  The chairs of GFC and its standing committees will be responsible for guiding \nmeetings of GFC and its standing committees, enforcing rules, and deciding questions \npertaining to those rules.

Debates without Motions \n11.1  When discussion of an issue and the formal rules pertaining to making motions, \ndebate, and voting seem to be a hindrance to thoughtful discussion, the GFC agenda \ncan allow for a less structured discussion guided by the Chair and the consensus of \nthe members in attendance.  \n12. Attendance  \n 12.1 Delegates – members who serve on GFC or its standing committees by virtue of their \noffice may send a delegate; such delegates shall act with all the rights of membership.  \nThere shall be no alternates for other members. \n 12.2 GFC attendance - If a student misses two consecutive meetings or more than three \nmeetings, the Students’ Union or the Graduate Students’ Association may request that \nthe Chair declare the position vacant.

The motion will be duly moved and \nseconded and all normal procedures will be followed in conducting the e-mail ballot. \nHowever, upon receiving the item of business and ballot, any committee member may \nrequest that the matter be debated at the next meeting or at a special meeting and the \nvote delayed until after that debate, with the Chair determining the appropriate course \nof action.  \n 13.7 Electronic Votes by GFC – In cases where GFC is the electing body to populate \ncertain selection committees and other bodies, the election process may use e-vote \nmechanisms. \n 13.8 Electronic Approval of Committee Reports by GFC – Reports from the Nominating and \nReplenishment Committees may be distributed electronically to GFC members and are \nconsidered approved by the deadlines indicated on the report subject to receipt of \nadditional nominations.   \n14.

ASC acts for GFC in approving routine and/or editorial changes to \nboth admission/transfer policies and academic standing regulations” \n3. UAPPOL Admissions Policy: “Admission to the University of Alberta \nis based on documented academic criteria established by individual \nFaculties and approved by GFC. This criteria may be defined in areas \nsuch as subject requirements, minimum entrance averages, and \nlanguage proficiency requirements. In addition to academic requirements \nfor admission, GFC authorizes each Faculty to establish such other \nreasonable criteria for admission of applicants as the Faculty may \nconsider appropriate to its programs of study, subject to the approval of \nGFC (e.g. interview, audition, portfolio, etc.) \nThe admission requirements for any Faculty will be those approved by \nGFC as set forth in the current edition of the University Calendar. In \naddition to the admission requirements, selection criteria for quota \nprograms, where they exist, will also be published in the current edition \nof the University Calendar. \nThe responsibility for admission decisions will be vested in the Faculty \nAdmission Committees or in the Deans of the respective Faculties, as \nthe councils of such Faculties will determine.” \n4.  UAPPOL Admissions Procedure: \n“PROCEDURE \n1. EFFECTIVE DATE OF CHANGES TO ADMISSION REGULATIONS \nFollowing approval by GFC: \na. Where changes to admission regulations may disadvantage students \nin the current admission cycle, normally implementation will be effective \nafter the change has been published in the University Calendar for one \nfull year (i.e., effective the second year that the information is published \nin the University Calendar). \nItem No. 5A – 5C \nGFC ACADEMIC STANDARDS COMMITTEE \nFor the Meeting of September 21, 2017 \nFor example, a change approved in May 2005 would be first published in \nthe 2006-2007 University Calendar in March 2006. Therefore the \nstatement cannot come into effect until September 2007 (affecting \napplicants who apply for the September 2007 term beginning July \n2006).” \nb. Where changes to admission regulations are deemed by the \napproving body to be ‘advantageous to students’, normally the date of \nimplementation will be effective immediately or at the next available \nintake for the admitting Faculty.” \n5.  PSLA: The PSLA gives Faculty Councils the authority to “determine \nthe conditions under which a student must withdraw from or may \ncontinue the student’s program of studies in a faculty” (Section 29(1)(d)). \n6. UAPPOL Academic Standing Policy:  “All current academic \nstanding regulations, including academic standing categories, University \ngraduating standards and requirements for all individual programs will be \nthose prescribed by Faculty Councils and GFC as set forth in the \nUniversity Calendar.” \n7. UAPPOL Academic Standing Regulations Procedures: “All \nproposed new academic standing regulations and changes to existing \nacademic standing regulations will be submitted by the Faculties or the \nAdministration to the Provost and Vice-President (Academic). Faculties \nwill also submit to the Provost and Vice-President (Academic) any \nproposed changes to the use and/or computation of averages relating to \nacademic standing, including promotion and graduation. \nIf the Provost and Vice-President (Academic) determines the proposal to \nbe in good order, the proposal will be introduced to the appropriate \nUniversity governance process(es). In considering these proposals, \ngovernance bodies will consult as necessary with the Faculties and with \nother individuals and offices. \nNormally, changes become effective once they are approved by GFC or \nits delegate and are published in the University Calendar.” \nAttachments  \n1.
