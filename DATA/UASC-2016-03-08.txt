            "Description": "Purpose of the Proposal: For information/discussion Discussion: Ms Halbert reported that this document originated from the identified need for an institutional strategy for undergraduate support, adding that within this last 18 months, this issue has been recognized by various members of the academy, including the President, members of the Students’ Union, and members of the Board of Governors as an important strategy for recruitment and retention of students. She noted that the last year has been spent consulting on this issue, in an attempt to gather feedback from the community on how best to proceed. During her presentation, Ms Halbert outlined the current challenges, including the lack of a single repository for UFS information; the absence of an institutional strategy; technological constraints; USF program imbalances; imbalances within the revenue streams and programs, and a lack of fundraising alignment. In order to address these issues, she explained, the document identifies five foundational actions which are vital for the University of Alberta to review as part of this strategy (called “The Financial Five”), including alignment of institutional student financial support and enrolment priorities; the identification of continuous and targeted levels of funding; improving technology and communication supports; exploring the establishment of an institutional policy to articulate principles and guide decision-making and establishing a cross-functional stakeholder advisory group. In terms of a timeline for this strategy to move forward, she provided members with dates surrounding how the document will be developed and presented to members of the community. Members, during the discussion surrounding this Discussion Paper, expressed a number of comments and questions, including, but not limited to: that there needs to be an ease of systems for USF processes; that some of the most financially vulnerable groups of potential students cannot access electronic information; a suggestion for a tuition calculator, so students can plan appropriately for their education; discussion surrounding the different university units that all play a role in this strategy. The Chair thanked Ms Halbert for her presentation.",

This document speaks to both short term and \nlong term strategies.  \nThe current UFS model for operates without defined institutional principles to guide decision making on \npriorities or targets. With the current nature of our internal and external environments, reliance on historical \nprograms and past practice have become ineffective in managing resources and most notably, supporting \nstudents. It is incumbent upon us to craft a new strategy that meets the goals of our institution and makes a \npositive difference in the lives of our students. \nCase for Action \nThe changes in environment referenced above include:       \n● Direction from senior leadership -  \n○ The need for a UFS Strategy has been a frequent topic of discussion by senior \nleadership at the University of Alberta. Most notably, the topic arose during the 2014 - \n2015 Board of Governors conversations on student access and funding. As well, \nconstructing a support strategy is an expressed priority of the Students’ Union, and was \nnoted in the recommendations of the 2013 Provost’s Student Financial Aid Task Force. \n● Release of a new Institutional Strategic Plan (ISP) -  \n○ The timing of developing a new strategic plan for UFS dovetails with the release of the \nnew ISP, which will guide the institution into the future. \n● UFS is an important component of Undergraduate Recruitment -   \n○ Undergraduate financial support has been identified in the National Recruitment Strategy \nDiscussion Paper as a critical component in recruitment success. That need for a \nNational Recruitment Strategy was identified by President David Turpin. The Discussion \nPaper has been vetted by senior leaders of the University of Alberta and a tactical \nplanning phase is now underway, with campus community stakeholders.  \n● Enrolment Management. \n○ In December 2015, the Office of the Registrar released the third Annual Report on \nUndergraduate Enrolment for 2015-2016. The data provides a critical, current snapshot, \nimportant historical data, and trend analysis that allows the institution to make informed \ndecisions. UFS is a recognized component of strategic enrolment management as both a \nrecruitment and retention tool, and as such, requires a similar level of institutional \nawareness and direction in order to effectively meet enrolment goals. \n3 \nCurrent State and Known Gaps / Challenges \nWhile financial support programs are not exclusive to the Office of the Registrar (RO), the RO acts on \nbehalf of the University to develop and/or administer the vast majority of financial support programs to \n(predominantly) undergraduate1 students with funds received from: \n- Provincial Government's (student loans and awards),  \n- Federal Government (student loans),  \n- University of Alberta Operating2 (non-restricted),  \n- University of Alberta Restricted (endowment earnings and annual donations).  \nAlthough there are successful aspects of the current financial support programs, UFS at the University of \nAlberta face a number of challenges, including: \n• No Single Repository of USF Information: No comprehensive knowledge / understanding of all \nUFS available at the University of Alberta exists, as not all supports flow through the RO. As a \nresult, the University is unable to capture and report on financial supports in its entirety and we \ntherefore lack the context to adequately establish new, or review existing UFS programs against \nthe backdrop of institutional and enrolment management goals. \n• No Institutional Overarching Strategy: Various competitor institutions have policy in place to \naddress the issue of need based support for qualified students who lack the financial resources to \nattend. The University of Alberta does not have policy to address such situations, preventing \nfinancial supports from being approached strategically. A lack of an overarching strategy impacts \nrecruitment, retention and perceptions of the institution. \n• Technological Constraints: A combination of our current technology and decentralized \ninformation impacts our ability to plan, forecast, operationalize, report on, and evaluate current \nsupports.  \n• USF Program Imbalances: Existing programs and funding allocations do not support students \nacross areas of study or year of program. Most notably, need based supports for students \nentering their first year of study are not currently funded. Conversely, merit based funding is \nprovided primarily to entrance students while students achieving top academic standing in their \nsubsequent years of study are not funded at a comparable level. These imbalances prevent the \ndistribution of financial supports in such a way that supports both access to education and \nrecognition of achievement. \n• Imbalance in Revenue Streams and Programs: The increasingly competitive undergraduate \nmarket dictates a need to identify and achieve the optimal balance between need- and merit-\nbased funding within and across programs of study; no such balance currently exists. \nEstablishing and maintaining revenue streams that fund a balanced and competitive student \nfinancial support model to attract and retain top students and respond to access concerns is \nimperative. \n1 The RO also administers need based supports for graduate students. Merit based programs are primarily administered \nby the Faculty of Graduate Studies and Research. \n2 The International merit based recruitment programs (funded by the International Differential Fees) are administered by \nthe RO in consultation with University of Alberta International. A specific strategy for international scholarships is not \nincorporated in this discussion paper. \n4 \n• Lack of Fundraising Alignment: No clear alignment exists between fundraising activities and \nallocations from the operating budget to enrolment and institutional priorities.  \nIdeal Future State  \nThe establishment of the ISP is being led by the question “how can we build a great university for the \npublic good and the betterment of our community, nation and world” (Discussion Paper, October 2015). \nResponding to this complex question means building a comprehensive framework for UFS that includes \nthe following: \n• Support and access for  undergraduate students that enhances institutional competitiveness and \nis aligned with the university’s overarching enrolment priorities and practices,  \n• Use of data and client intelligence to guide decision making. Of note, the first annual Student \nFinancial Support Report, reporting on the 2015-16 financial year, will be released in 2016 and \nwill provide key current-state information on UFS.  \n• Knowledge of, and access to data on all University of Alberta programs that support UFS, \n• Strategies to measure program success (how, why, when), \n• Agility and responsiveness in UFS programming (in response to legislation, policy, data, client \nintelligence, situational context, etc.), \n• Ongoing, secure funding, including designation as a significant focus for fundraising initiatives, \n• Support from our stakeholders, including senior leadership at the University of Alberta. \nFoundational Building Blocks - The Financial Five  \nTo build a comprehensive framework, we have identified five foundational actions that are vital, if the \nUniversity of Alberta aspires to become a leader in Student Financial Support. \n1. Align institutional student financial support and enrolment priorities \na. Connect undergraduate merit- and need-based student financial support programs to \nuniversity and faculty enrolment goals \nb. Include specific supports for the recruitment and retention of institutionally identified priority \nenrolment groups, e.g., Aboriginal (First Nations, Metis and Inuit) and International students \nc. Pursue equitable funding in support of faculty and institutional enrolment priorities for \ncontinuing students who  achieve high academic achievement on a full normal course load \n2. Continuous and targeted levels of funding  \na. Identification and acquisition of sustained funding to meet the financial requirements of a \ntop-notch student financial support program \nb. Allocation of appropriate and consistent levels of institutional funding, directly connected to \ninstitutional priorities and enrolment goals \nc. Collaboration with the Office of Advancement to establish giving opportunities for need- and \nmerit-based student financial support programs as part of institutional fundraising \ncampaigns \n3. Improve technological and communication supports \na. Effective student financial support administration requires robust, scalable technology that \nprovides: \ni. Student-facing front end: improved user experience, financial \n5 \nadvising, easy access to information, and other services; \nii. Administration back end: facilitate program planning, financial management and \nbudgeting, program management, and reporting \nb. Implementation of regular institutional reporting, including benchmarking against \ncomparator data, to support assessment of current programming and sound decision \nmaking regarding future program design \nc. Provision of high quality cross-institutional financial literacy training, related resources and \nsupport services for staff and students \n4. Explore establishing institutional policy to articulate principles and guide decision making \nThe Office of the Registrar will lead the exploration, discussion and recommendations to senior \nleadership that explore the implications of establishing policy that speaks to institutional \ncommitments to need- and merit- based UFS.  \n5. Establish a cross-functional stakeholder Advisory Group \na. The Advisory Committee on Undergraduate Financial Support (ACUS) will be chaired by \nthe Registrar (or delegate) and will bring together units involved in undergraduate financial \nsupport programs, service delivery, and possible policy development, e.g., faculty \nadministrators, Advancement, Financial Services, Dean of Students, Provost’s Office, UAI \nb. In consultation with student leaders, the group will seek to align student financial support \npractices with the ISP and Strategic Enrolment Management principles, facilitate \nunderstanding of emerging and high impact issues, and make recommendations to senior \nleadership on how best to meet the financial support needs of undergraduate students and \nenrolment priorities \nc. ACUS will provide a forum for data sharing, reporting, and sharing of best practices for all \ntypes of financial support available to undergraduate students \nd. ACUS will aim to identify opportunities for collaboration and efficiencies in the area of \nundergraduate student financial support \ne. Student success will be a priority for ACUS, whereby the group will work to ensure financial \nsupport programs and processes address challenges impacting student success \n  Short Term Program Plan \nKey institutional documents, such as the Institutional Strategic Plan, a National Recruitment Strategy, the \nAnnual Enrolment Report and the Annual Report on Undergraduate Financial Support will identify areas of \nfocus for financial support and will help guide discussions and decisions for the long term USF strategy. In \nthe interim, the University has the opportunity to immediately begin addressing identified gaps in current \nprograms. The top four priorities are: \n#1 - Merit based - Continuing Students: Budget cuts to unrestricted program funds in Fiscal 2014 directly \nimpacted the merit based financial supports provided to continuing students. Approximately 40% of merit \nbased funding is awarded to students in their first year of studies as Entrance Awards, even though they \nmake up only ~15% of the undergraduate student body. In order to support student retention we need to \nensure merit based financial supports for continuing students are provided.  \n#2 - Need based - Entrance Students: Currently, bursaries are not available to students entering the \nUniversity from High School. As access to postsecondary education becomes a priority, it is paramount that \nentrance students be provided with equal opportunity to need based supports. \n6 \n#3 - Merit based - Entrance Students:  Entrance Merit programs have been evaluated and funds will be \nallocated based on new and current underfunded national recruitment priorities to help ensure our \ncompetitiveness. New programs will include a dedicated aboriginal program, enhancements to the existing \nleadership program, resources for students outside Edmonton Capital Region, and an increase to the \nprestigious, renewable citations created with the intention of attracting top students.  \n#4 - Need based - Continuing Students: Though funds currently exists for this initiative, increasing the \nallocation would allow us, should institutional priorities support, to increase bursary support for priority \ngroups which would aim to address the issue of access. Increasing need based allocations for continuing \nstudents will support retention goals. \nDraft Timelines for Creating a Strategy for Undergraduate Financial Support \nDate Action \nFebruary/March-16 Circulate to stakeholders and discuss Draft Discussion Paper for UFS \nMay-16 Release of the first Annual Report on Undergraduate Student Financial \nSupport \nMay-16 Release Final document – Discussion Paper for UFS \nJune-16 Develop terms of reference for ACUS and recruit members \nJune-16 RO initiates and leads the process of developing the long term Program Plan \nfor ACUS discussion \nSeptember-16 First ACUS meeting - Begin discussions on long term Program Plan.  \n7 \nAPPENDIX A \nBenchmarking Against Top Canadian Competitors \nAs a Top 5 University in Canada (2015 QS World University Rankings, 2015 Maclean's University \nRankings), the University of Alberta is among the country’s most prestigious post- secondary institutions. \nA 2014 Public Perceptions Study (Ipsos Reid 2014, University of Alberta - Marketing and \nCommunications) determined that one of the top three drivers of trust for the University of Alberta is \nbased on the care it shows for the success of students. As financial stress has been shown to have a \ndirect impact on student well-being and academic performance3, the establishment of financial support \nservices will provide a framework to help minimize student financial stress4\nand in turn support student \nsuccess. \nIn order to increase UAlberta’s national and international profile and competitiveness in these markets, \nit is helpful to understand the characteristics of our comparator institutions on their financial support \nofferings.

In order to be competitive, \nfinancial support programs must address and provide comprehensive merit- and need-based \nopportunities addressing all student types that will support the institutional enrolment goals. See \nBenchmarking Against Top 5 below for Canadian peer institutional comparisons. \n● Financial support information needs to be accessible and promoted effectively in order for \nprospective students and their parents to make informed decisions about attending a postsecondary \ninstitution5 \n● Providing prospective students with information on need based support (bursaries and loans) is \nintegral to ensuring qualified students do not pre-emptively choose not to pursue postsecondary \neducation based on a lack of understanding of financial options6 \n● Merit based programs (scholarships and awards) rewarding academic achievement continue \nto have impact on high achieving students’ decisions related to choosing a postsecondary \nover another7 \n● The Government of Canada has recognized the need to play an active role in supporting \nCanadians to “gain the knowledge, skills and confidence they need to make good financial \ndecisions” (National Strategy for Financial Literacy - Count Me In, Canada). As finances are cited \nas a primary barrier to access to postsecondary education (Ross, 2007 - The Effect of \nInstitutional Merit-Based Aid on Student Aspirations, Choice and Participation) PSIs need to \nestablish financial literacy programs that provide students with the tools necessary to achieve \ntheir educational goals without encountering undue financial stress. A recent survey conducted by \nthe former Student Financial Aid and Information Centre (services now provided through Student \nFinancial Support) at the University of Alberta indicates that over 50% of students frequently \nworry about their finances (More Than Money: Value Based Financial Literacy and Decision \nMaking, CASFAA Conference 2014). \n● Timing of financial support offers are important for international student decision making about what \ninstitution to attend. Early offers have the greatest impact. (UAI Customer Relations Index Inc \nigraduate survey 2013) \n● Government loan funding has not increased at the same rate as tuition and cost of living. Looking \nat the Alberta Government loan program in particular, the annual loan limit has increased by \n$2,000 since 2007 (Junor and Usher, 2007), going from $13,000 per year to $15,000 (Student Aid \nAlberta Operational and Policy Manual). This has created a gap between loans and non-repayable \nprograms (scholarship and bursary programs) that students look to PSI to help fill.  \n5 Student Decisions Project - Final Report, Higher Education Strategy Associates, 2015 \n6 Student Decisions Project - Final Report, Higher Education Strategy Associates, 2015 \n7 Student Decisions Project - Wave 4 Interim Report, Higher Education Strategy Associates, October 2015 \nhttp://www.heqco.ca/SiteCollectionDocuments/Suzanne%20Tyson_Student%20Attitudes%20Toward%20Higher%20Education.pdf\nhttps://qspace.library.queensu.ca/bitstream/1974/5782/1/Price_of_Knowledge-2004.pdf\nhttp://www.fcac-acfc.gc.ca/Eng/financialLiteracy/financialLiteracyCanada/strategy/Pages/home-accueil.aspx\nhttp://www.educationalpolicy.org/pdf/EndofNeed.pdf\nhttp://studentaid.alberta.ca/media/63020/student-aid-alberta-operational-policy-and-procedure-manual.pdf\nhttp://studentaid.alberta.ca/media/63020/student-aid-alberta-operational-policy-and-procedure-manual.pdf\n9 \nAPPENDIX C \nQuick Link Reference \n1. studentawards inc 2011 for Higher Education Quality Council of Ontario \n2.

Align institutional student financial support and enrolment priorities \na. Connect undergraduate merit- and need-based student financial support programs to university \nand faculty enrolment goals \nb. Include specific supports for the recruitment and retention of institutionally identified priority \nenrolment groups, e.g., Aboriginal (First Nations, Metis and Inuit) and International students \nc. Pursue equitable funding in support of faculty and institutional enrolment priorities for continuing \nstudents who  achieve high academic achievement on a full normal course load \n2. Continuous and targeted levels of funding  \na. Identification and acquisition of sustained funding to meet the financial requirements of a top-\nnotch student financial support program \nb. Allocation of appropriate and consistent levels of institutional funding, directly connected to \ninstitutional priorities and enrolment goals \nc. Collaboration with the Office of Advancement to establish giving opportunities for need- and \nmerit-based student financial support programs as part of institutional fundraising campaigns \n3. Improve technological and communication supports \na. Effective student financial support administration requires robust, scalable technology that \nprovides student-facing front end and administration back end improvements \nb. Implementation of regular institutional reporting, including benchmarking against comparator \ndata, to support assessment of current programming and sound decision making regarding \nfuture program design \nc. Provision of high quality cross-institutional financial literacy training, related resources and \nsupport services for staff and students \n4. Explore establishing institutional policy to articulate principles and guide decision making \nThe Office of the Registrar will lead the exploration, discussion and recommendations to senior \nleadership that explore the implications of establishing policy that speaks to institutional \ncommitments to need- and merit- based UFS.  \n5. Establish a cross-functional stakeholder Advisory Group \na. The Advisory Committee on Undergraduate Financial Support (ACUS) will be chaired by the \nRegistrar (or delegate) and will bring together units involved in undergraduate financial support \nprograms, service delivery, and possible policy development, e.g., faculty administrators, \nAdvancement, Financial Services, Dean of Students, Provost’s Office, UAI \nb. In consultation with student leaders, the group will seek to align student financial support \npractices with the ISP and Strategic Enrolment Management principles, facilitate understanding \nof emerging and high impact issues, and make recommendations to senior leadership on how \nbest to meet the financial support needs of undergraduate students and enrolment priorities \nc. ACUS will provide a forum for data sharing, reporting, and sharing of best practices for all types \nof financial support available to undergraduate students \nd. ACUS will aim to identify opportunities for collaboration and efficiencies in the area of \nundergraduate student financial support \ne. Student success will be a priority for ACUS, whereby the group will work to ensure financial \nsupport programs and processes address challenges impacting student success \nShort Term Program Plan Fiscal 2016/2017 \nKey leadership documents will identify areas of focus for \nfinancial support and will help guide discussions and \ndecisions for the long term USF strategy. In the interim, \nand through the provision of additional funds in Fiscal \n2017, the University has the opportunity to begin \naddressing identified gaps in current programs.  \n#1 - Merit based - Continuing Students: Budget cuts to \nunrestricted program funds in Fiscal 2014 directly \nimpacted the merit based financial supports provided to \ncontinuing students. Approximately 40% of merit based \nfunding is awarded to students in their first year of studies \nas Entrance Awards, even though they make up only \n~15% of the undergraduate student body. In order to \nsupport student retention we need to ensure merit based \nfinancial supports for continuing students are provided.  \n#2 - Need based - Entrance Students: Currently, \nbursaries are not available to students entering the \nUniversity from High School. As access to postsecondary \neducation becomes a priority, it is paramount that \nentrance students be provided with equal opportunity to \nneed based supports. \n#3 - Merit based - Entrance Students: Entrance Merit \nprograms have been evaluated and funds will be \nallocated based on new and current underfunded national \nrecruitment priorities to help ensure our competitiveness. \nNew programs will include a dedicated aboriginal \nprogram, enhancements to the existing leadership \nprogram, resources for students outside Edmonton \nCapital Region, and an increase to the prestigious, \nrenewable citations created with the intention of attracting \ntop students.  \n#4 - Need based - Continuing Students: Though funds \ncurrently exists for this initiative, increasing the allocation \nwould allow us, should institutional priorities support, to \nincrease bursary support for priority groups which would \naim to address the issue of access. Increasing need \nbased allocations for continuing students will support \nretention goals. \n. \nGaps/Challenges Summary \n No single repository of USF information \n No institutional overarching strategy \n Technology constraints \n USF program structure \n Imbalance in revenue streams and programs \n Lack of fundraising alignment \nOFFICE OF THE REGISTRAR – FINANCIAL FIVE SUMMARY Version 2 – February 21, 2016 \n\tFinal\n\tItem-4-New-Awards-for-Approval\n\tItem-4-New-Awards-Bursaries-for-Approval-OI\n\tItem-4-New-Awards-Bursaries-for-Approval-ATT1\n\tAboriginal Award in Medicine\n\tAlberta Lawyers’ Assistance Society Award\n\tAnna Bychinsky Fine Arts Award in Art and Design\n\tAnna Bychinsky Fine Arts Award in Drama\n\tAnna Bychinsky Fine Arts Award in Music\n\tBacchus Family (SCRR) Scholarship in Science\n\tCatherine Miller Community Service Award\n\tDr Barry Irving Award in Wildlife and Rangeland Resources Management\n\tFaculty of Law Annual Fund Bursary\n\tG Donald Love Global Leadership Scholarship\n\tHajduk Gibbs LLP Aboriginal Award\n\tJohn and May Bowland Memorial Bursary\n\tKelly Jenkins Memorial Award\n\tKen and Patricia Cleall Scholarship in Music Education\n\tLouie Family Award in Medicine\n\tMark Chytracek Leadership Award\n\tRhonda Zacharias Memorial Award\n\tRobert Francis Bursary in Medicine\n\tS Bychinsky Award for Creative Writing\n\tSylvia Jean Grant Memorial Award\n\tT G Abraham Memorial Bursary in Engineering\n\tT G Abraham Memorial Academic Excellence Scholarship in Engineering\n\tItem-5-Amendments-to-Existing-Awards-for-Approval\n\tItem-5-Existing-Awards-for-Approval-OI\n\tItem-5-Existing-Awards-for-Approval-ATT1\n\tBourse de Performance Faculté Saint-Jean / Faculté Saint-Jean Academic Performance\n\tDr and Mrs Hazen Hankinson Dean's Undergraduate Citation in Medicine\n\tPresident's Award for Refugees and Displaced Persons\n\tItem-6-Discussion-Paper-UG-Student-Financial-Support\n\tItem-6-Discussion-Paper-UG-Student-Support-OI\n\tItem-6-Discussion-Paper-ATT1\n\tTable of Contents\n\tIntroduction\n\tCase for Action\n\tCurrent State and Known Gaps / Challenges\n\tIdeal Future State\n\tFoundational Building Blocks - The Financial Five\n\tShort Term Program Plan\n\tDraft Timelines for Creating a Strategy for Undergraduate Financial Support\n\tAPPENDIX A\n\tBenchmarking Against Top Canadian Competitors\n\tAPPENDIX B\n\tUFS - Background Data\n\tAPPENDIX C\n\tQuick Link Reference\n\tItem-6-Discussion-Paper-Summary\n",
