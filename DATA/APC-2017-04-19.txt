Dr Dew noted that the CIP is structured around the government’s five principles: accessibility, affordability, quality, coordination, and accountability; but that it also aligns with the goals within For the Public Good. Members discussed the projected enrolment targets in the document, the goals in relation to equity in recruitment, how outcomes will be measured, the impact of the United States’ travel ban on international recruitment, and the use of the Academic Price Index (API).",

However, close examination determined all 3 were actually \nUndeclared majors who were reported as Musical Arts majors due to the \nreporting requirements stipulated by the Government of Alberta.  The \nlast reported Musical Arts major was in 2010. \nGiven the lack of registrations in these majors, consultation with the \nOffice of the Provost and Vice President (Academic) and the \nGovernment of Alberta recommended moving forward with the \ntermination of these majors, without a period of suspension. \nEngagement and Routing (Include meeting dates) \nItem No. 4 \nGFC ACADEMIC PLANNING COMMITTEE \nFor the Meeting of April 19, 2017 \nParticipation: \n(parties who have seen the \nproposal and in what capacity) \n<For further information see \nthe link posted on the \nGovernance Toolkit section \nStudent Participation Protocol> \nThose who have been informed: \n• Wide ranging discussions in Summer/Fall of 2016 on Augustana \nFaculty within the Music division, Department of Fine Arts and \nHumanities, Augustana Dean’s Office, Augustana Prospective \nStudents Office, Augustana Learning, Advising & Beyond Office, \nAugustana Registrar’s Office. \nThose who have been consulted: \n• Karsten Mündel, Augustana Associate Dean, Academic, \nDecember 11, 2015 \n• Jonathan Hawkins, Assistant Registrar, Augustana Campus, \nNovember 9, 2016 \n• Kate Peters, Office of the Provost Portfolio Initiatives Manager, \nNovember 23, 2016 \n• Department of Fine Arts and Humanities Meeting, January 9. \n2017 \n• Augustana Curriculum Committee Meeting, January 12, 2017 \nThose who are actively participating: \n• Milton Schlosser, Professor of Music and Director of Music, \nAugustana Faculty \n• Augustana Music Division – regular consultation with all Music \ninstructors, staff, and students at Augustana Faculty in Spring, \nSummer, Fall, 2016. \n• Augustana Music Division meeting to propose termination of \nmajors, November 14, 2016 \nApproval Route (Governance) \n(including meeting dates) \nAugustana Faculty Council – February 6, 2017  \nGFC Academic Planning Committee – April 19, 2017  \nGeneral Faculties Council – Fall 2017 (meeting times to be determined) \nBoard Learning and Discovery Committee – Fall 2017 (meeting times to \nbe determined) \nBoard of Governors – Fall 2017 (meeting times to be determined) \nFinal Approver Board of Governors \nAlignment/Compliance \nAlignment with Guiding \nDocuments \nFor the Public Good  \nGOAL: SUSTAIN our people, our work, and the environment by \nattracting and stewarding the resources we need to deliver excellence to \nthe benefit of all.  \nObjective 21: Encourage continuous improvement in administrative, \ngovernance, planning, and stewardship systems, procedures, and \npolicies that enable students, faculty, staff, and the institution as a whole \nto achieve shared strategic goals. \nCompliance with Legislation, \nPolicy and/or Procedure \nRelevant to the Proposal \n(please quote legislation and \ninclude identifying section \nnumbers) \n1.

Rationale for suspension (for example, changes in applications, enrolment, employer \ndemand, program obsolescence, etc.).  Comment on the alignment of the proposed change \nwith the institution’s strategic direction and priorities.  If enrolment is a key rationale, \nprovide historical enrolment data. \n2. Anticipated impacts on students and graduates and plans to ameliorate these impacts.  \nDescribe the institution’s plan to teach out active students and stop-outs.  Include evidence \nof consultation with students and a communications plan for informing stopped-out \nstudents of the change. \n3. Identify anticipated impacts on external stakeholders (e.g. employers, professional/ \nregulatory organizations, other post-secondary institutions) and provide evidence of \nconsultation. \n4. Identify anticipated impacts on institutional operations and resources (e.g. operating \nbudget, staffing, student services, information technology, library, classroom and lab \nspace).  Discuss plans for the reallocation of any resources freed up by the proposed \nsuspension.   \nB:  Reactivation \n1. Rationale for reactivation (for example, increased employer demand, student demand, new \nfunding sources, etc.).  Comment on the alignment of the proposed change with the \ninstitution’s strategic direction and priorities. \n2. Identify anticipated impacts on institutional operations and resources (e.g. operating \nbudget, staffing, student services, information technology, library, and classroom and lab \nspace). \n3. Provide a simplified enrolment plan using the following table.  Include assumptions and \nexplanatory notes (e.g., attrition, part-time enrolment). \nProposed Enrolment Year 1 Year 2 Year 3 Year 4 Year 5 Annual Ongoing \nIntake (head count) 0 0 0 0 0 0 \nTotal head count 0 0 0 0 0 0 \nTotal FLE 0 0 0 0 0 0 \nAnticipated No. of Graduates 0 0 0 0 0 0 \nC:  Termination \n1. Describe measures taken by the institution to ensure that active students and stop-outs have \nhad ample opportunity to complete their programs of study. \nNo student has been registered in either the Augustana Bachelor of Music Liturgical Arts \nmajor or Musical Arts major since the University of Alberta began officially maintaining \nthe Augustana Faculty student records in September 2006.   Official student headcounts \nreported to the Government of Alberta by the University indicate no students registered in \nLiturgical Arts since 2006.  Three Musical Arts registrations were reported (1 each in 2006, \n2007, and 2010); however, close examination determined all 3 were actually Undeclared \nstudents who were reported as being Musical Arts majors due to reporting requirements.  \nThe students reported in 2006 and 2007 subsequently graduated from the University of \nAlberta – Augustana Faculty with different BMus majors; the student reported in 2010 \nwithdrew from the program after the Fall 2010 and has not returned to the University. If \nthis student returns, as an Undeclared major, she can still choose between the remaining \nBMus majors offered by Augustana Faculty - Comprehensive, Piano, and Voice - and \nwould not even notice the change in offerings.  As such, there are no active students or \nstop-outs eligible for these majors. \nThe Augustana Fine Arts and Humanities Department has informed the Augustana \nProspective Students Office of the intention to terminate these majors.  Historically, there \nhas been no demand for registration in these programs, but in the highly unlikely event of \nan applicant requesting consideration for either major in the current admission cycle, such \nan applicant would be directed into one of the three remaining BMus majors offered by \nAugustana Faculty – Comprehensive, Piano, or Voice. \n2. Where applicable, summarize the actual re-allocation of resources during the period of \nsuspension, and any additional re-allocation anticipated upon termination, and specify the \nimpacts of re-allocation on institutional operations.   \nUpon recommendation of the Office of the Provost and Vice President (Academic) in \nconsultation with the Government of Alberta, Augustana Faculty proposes to terminate \nboth majors without a period of suspension.  The lack of registration in either major results \nin no resources available for reallocation, but does allow for a clarity of opportunity and \nresourcing for the remaining three majors in the Augustana BMus program. \nAppendix 1: 2018/19 Calendar Changes for Augustana Faculty \nCurrent (2017-18 Calendar Entry Proposed (2018-19) Calendar Entry \nBachelor of Music (BMus) \n[Augustana] \nOverview \nThe Bachelor of Music program consists of \n★122, including ★65 of core music \nrequirements, ★24 in one of the five Bachelor \nof Music majors, and ★33 of non-music \nrequirements. In two of these majors, Liturgical \nArts and Musical Arts, a minor is required; in \nthe other three majors, Piano, Voice, and \nComprehensive, a minor is optional. The minor \nconsists of a minimum of ★18 in one discipline \nor approved interdisciplinary area, including at \nleast ★12 at the senior level. A student should \nbe aware that it may not be possible to complete \ncertain combinations of majors and minors \nwithout extending the time required to earn the \ndegree. \nResidence Requirement \nStudents registered in a BMus program must \ncomplete at least 60 senior credits offered by the \nAugustana Faculty.

There are 24 credits taken within seven required courses and two \nintegrated practicum(see appendix A.) in the program.  This program can be completed over the Fall/Winter and \nSpring/Summer semesters of one year.  Clinical practicum totaling 200 hours must also be completed before \ncertification.  \n1.6  Program Description \nProvide a brief (1-2 paragraphs) description of the program, summarizing its intended purpose, curriculum \ndesign, and methods of delivery and highlighting distinctive attributes.  Attach as an Appendix a complete list of \ncourses, including credit values, instructional hours and brief (calendar style) course descriptions.  For elective \noptions, specify course selection parameters. Identify new courses to be developed for this program.   \nDespite the growing Francophone population in Alberta and the associated needs in health-related \nservices in French, no French-language Health Care Aide program is available in Alberta. Approval is \nhereby sought for the Centre collégial de l’Alberta to fill this educational gap by offering a one year \nHealth Care Aide program (Préposé aux soins de santé - PSS) to French-speaking cohorts of students.  \nThis program, which   complies with the standards set out in the Alberta Health curriculum, aims at \ndeveloping the skills needed to provide safe, ethical and respectful care according to the client’s needs. \nThe proposed program includes topics on personal care, assisting with mobility, feeding needs and \nmedication delivery, communication, and clinical skills. The program delivery is a blend of classroom \nlearning, practical training in labs, and clinical instruction in long-term care, acute care and \ncommunity/home care settings. The admission requirements for the program include compulsory \nEnglish proficiency. Students admitted with a deficiency in English will have the opportunity to take \nEnglish as a Second Language training and will be required to meet proficiency levels before \nbeginning their practicum. Mosby’s Canadian Textbook for the Support Worker is the compulsory \ntextbook for the program as proposed by the provincial curriculum.  The textbook is not available in \nFrench and English language proficiency will need to be sufficient to follow the text.  \nOther specific training, such as CPR, may be provided in conjunction with this program so that \ngraduates are ready for the work force when they complete the program. Once the University of \nAlberta is licensed to provide the Heath Care Aide curriculum, graduates of the program will be \ncertified to fill Health Care Aide positions and will be able to offer health care services in both French \nand English. \n(See Appendix B for Calendar style course specific information.) \n1.7  Proposed Implementation Date \nSeptember 2017 \n1.8  Enrolment Plan \nInclude assumptions and explanatory notes (e.g., attrition, part-time enrolment).  Also: \n• If program implementation will occur over a number of years, provide data for each year to full \nimplementation. \n• If internal reallocation of existing resources is proposed, describe any anticipated decrease in \nenrolment in other programs that would result.   \nProposed Enrolment Year 1 Year 2 Year 3 Year 4 Year 5 Annual Ongoing \nTotal head count 8 8 8 8 8 8 \n• Full-Time Year 1 8 8 8 8 8 8 \nTotal FLE 0 0 0 0 0 0 \n• FLE Year 1 6.4 6.4 6.4 6.4 6.4 6.4 \nAnticipated No. of Graduates 8 8 8 8 8 8 \nSECTION 2:  DEMAND \n2.1  Student Demand Analysis \nAnalysis should be supported by relevant data for the region and for Campus Alberta, as might be derived from: \nsystematic questionnaire surveys of target audiences; application and enrolment summaries and trends for \nsimilar programs currently offered by other institutions; tabulations of unsolicited student inquiries and/or \nexpressions of interest obtained at student recruitment events; demographic projections for relevant sub-\npopulations.  \nThe target audience for the PSS program includes Francophone, French immersion and Core French \nhigh school graduates, adults in pursuit of career reorientation, and Francophone newcomers to \nAlberta. It is expected that the majority of students will be recruited within Alberta, but some students \nmay be attracted to the program from other Canadian provinces and territories. \nAlberta Education statistics indicate that the number of students enrolled in these various French \nlanguage programs is growing year-to-year.  A recent study (see Axion Market Study report, appendix \n1) of the pool of potential students shows that 20,889 young students are currently studying in French \nin the provinces and territories of Western Canada, in addition to the 302,849 attending immersion \nschools in the same area.  The report also indicated that over the last year, there has been a 4% increase \nin the number of students attending such schools.  Therefore, the pool of potential students is \napproximately 321,000 youth with knowledge of the French language who may want to take college or \nuniversity level programs in French.  To attract students, the institution is putting in place quality \nprograms in accordance with industry standards.  The programs are presented in an innovative manner \nin order to meet the needs of French-speaking students throughout Alberta and elsewhere in the West, \nbut also in order to train bilingual health care practitioners who will be able to operate in a dual \nlinguistic environment.  Because of the specific mandate, it has been given by the Ministry of \nAdvanced Education when it was created at Campus Saint-Jean at the University of Alberta, the Centre \ncollégial de l’Alberta is best suited to deliver such health programs in French in Western and Northern \nCanada.  \nConsultations with other institutions offering this program in French in other parts of Canada show that \nenrollment in programs varies from province to province as does the French-speaking population.  The \nfollowing table shows enrollment data in various institutions.  Some changes in regulation were made \nin Ontario which explains the variance between the two academic years of the program offered at La \nCité.  \nInstitution Program Academic year Enrollment  \nCollège Acadie, PEI \nPréposé aux soins de \nsanté \nImplemented in January \n2017 \n4 \nCollège \nEducacentre,  BC \nPréposé aux soins de \nsanté \n2015-2016 2016-2017 3 2 \nCollège \nCommunautaire NB \nService de soutien en \nsoins infirmiers \n2015-2016 2016-2017 64 62 \nCollège Boréal, ON Préposé aux services de \nsoutien personnel \n2015-2016 2016-2017 26 15 \nLa Cité, ON Préposé aux services de \nsoutien personnel \n2015-2016 2016-2017 98 23 \nUniversité Saint-\nBoniface, MB  \nAide en Soins de Santé 2015-2016 2016-2017 9 8 \n2.2  Labour Market Analysis \nAnalysis should be supported by relevant data and placed in the context of the target occupational/regional \nlabour market(s).  Relevant data sources include systematic surveys of prospective employers; occupational \nsupply/demand projections from government or industry sources; tabulations of job postings/‘help wanted’ \nadvertising; surveys of recruitment and graduate employment rates of similar programs; and demographic \nprojections (i.e. for relevant regions and sub-populations.)  Describe anticipated employment outcomes. \nTarget employment \nBilingual health care aides will find work in a variety of contexts. According to the data provided by \nAlberta Health, 90% of health care aides work in continuing care, while 10% work in acute care. \nHealth care aides (HCAs) can work at long-term care institutions or in the patient’s home. The hours of \nwork vary greatly, as some agencies offer 24-hour and weekend service. It therefore often involves \nshift work and weekend work. Given the nature of the work (lifting, washing and dressing patients), \naides may be required to lift heavy loads and remain standing for long periods. They must, therefore, \nbe in good health and be familiar with techniques for lifting patients without injuring them. \nIn Alberta, most people employed as HCAs work in the Health Care and Social Assistance industry \nand are employed by acute care hospitals, continuing care facilities, community care agencies, assisted \nliving centres, occupational health departments, primary care clinics and physicians' offices, schools, \ngroup homes and homes. There are several facilities who have expressed an interest in hiring bilingual \nhealth care aides (see Appendix X) By working collaboratively with nursing professionals and other \nhttp://alis.alberta.ca/occinfo/IndustryDescriptions/health.htm\nmembers of the overall health care team, health care aides provide daily personal assistance, comfort \nand support services for elderly, disabled, acute or chronically ill people who require short-term \nassistance, ongoing support or end-of-life care. They may help patients/residents with feeding, mobility \nand exercise as needed. (Source : http://www.albertahealthservices.ca/) .  \nContext and Rationale for Preparing Bilingual Health Professionals \nThere is a distinct need for French-language health services in Alberta. Training students who can \nprovide both French and English language services in a variety of healthcare settings would help to \nmeet that need. As stated in the Axion Market Study report, attached as Appendix 1, the Francophone \npopulation of Alberta is older than the province’s population. In fact, 27.8% of Francophones were 55 \nor older in 2011, compared to 21% of the population as a whole. As well, according to the 2006 census \nby Statistics Canada, 80% of Francophone seniors aged 65 and over were located in four census \ndivisions: 42% in the Edmonton metropolitan area, 22% in the greater Calgary area, 8% in northeastern \nregion, and 8% in the northwest (see attached market study report led by Axion).  \nThis situation will have an impact on the demand for health services over the short, medium and long \nterms. In fact, several Canadian and international studies show a sharp decline in the second language \nlearned (in this case English) among seniors after their retirement (Source:  Littératie en santé au \nCanada, une question de bien-être.  Conseil canadien sur l’apprentissage, Ottawa, 2008).  Moreover, \nstudies clearly show that, in stressful situations, seniors tend to turn to their mother tongue. Finally, \nseniors with a cognitive disability such as dementia gradually lose their ability to communicate in the \nsecond language learned. \nFurthermore, since the health care system is increasingly making use of home care, it is important to \nprovide the required bilingual personnel to meet the needs of French-speaking individuals.  \nAs demonstrated in the Market Study report, see Appendix 1, according to the 2011 National \nHousehold Survey, Francophones represent 2.1% of the total population of Alberta, or 74,075 people \nwhose first official language spoken (FOLS) is French. Between 2006 and 2011, the population of \nAlberta with French as their first official language spoken increased by 10.6%, from 67,000 to 74,074 \npeople. In 10 years (2001-2011), the population of Alberta with French as their first official language \nspoken increased by 19.5%, or 12,070 people. The sharp increase in the number of people with French \nas their first official language spoken is explained in large part by the arrival of recent immigrants \nwhose first official language spoken was French (see attached market study report led by Axion). In \nfact, three out of four new residents of Alberta (76.7%) with French as their first official language \nspoken were recent immigrants who arrived in Canada between 2001 and 2011.This growth in the \nFrancophone and bilingual population will lead to a rise in the demand for health services in French \nand to the creation of a growing number of positions that highlight bilingualism as an asset. \nIndeed, research indicates that language barriers are at the root cause of the variance often observed \nbetween the state of health of the majority population and that of the linguistic minority population \n(Source:  Language Barriers in Access to Health Care. Health Canada, 2001). In a 2005 study \nconducted by Réseau Santé Alberta, 82% of respondents indicated that as a result of the lack of \nFrench-language health services in Alberta they had had problems being understood, understanding the \ninformation provided to them, understanding the diagnosis, being referred to the right specialist, or \nother consequences. (Source: Réseau santé albertain, French Language Primary Health Care in \nhttp://www.albertahealthservices.ca/\nAlberta, 2007.)    \nThe present proposal is in line with the National Consortium for Health Training in French \n(Consortium National de Formation en Santé, CNFS, of which the Campus Saint-Jean is a member) \ninitiative aiming at developing the active offer of health services in French across the country. This aim \nbeing a major goal in their “Feuille de route 2013-2018” approved and financially supported by Health \nCanada. \nEmployability of graduates \nBilingual health care aides will have a unique added value to offer to employers making them preferred \ncandidates in certain contexts and in general, their employability will be high. In Alberta, 31,083 \npeople were working as nurse aides, orderlies and patient service associates as of December 31, 2014, \nmaking that category of profession the second largest in the number of employees in the province’s \nhealth sector. Given the average age of 44 for nurse aides, orderlies and patient service associates \n(NOC 3413), retirements are expected to increase considerably over the next few years. \nAccording to data from the Alberta Learning Information Service, obtained through the 2013 Alberta \nWage and Salary Survey, 40% of employers seeking to hire health care aides had difficulty finding \nemployees and 12% still had positions available after four months. According to the data, the vacancy \nrate for health care aides was at 4% in 2013. The demand for health care aides will continue to \nincrease, as health professionals are ageing and retiring and the Francophone population is continuing \nto age. As well, it is very difficult to find Francophone or bilingual health care aides. \nA number of sources indicate that the outlook for employment of Health Care Aides and in the health \nsector overall is excellent for the foreseeable future. Employment in the Health Care and Social \nAssistance industry is expected to grow between 2.0% and 2.9% annually between 2011 and 2015. \n(Source: Government of Alberta, Employment and Immigration, Alberta Modified Canadian \nOccupational Projection System (COPS) Outlook 2011 - 2015, Industry Employment Outlook). \nMoreover, Alberta’s Occupational Demand and Supply Outlook (2011-2021) predicts a growing \noccupational demand and supply shortage  of Assisting occupations in support of health services for \nthe foreseeable future (with a cumulative shortage of 2,322 by 2021) (Source: \nhttp://eae.alberta.ca/documents/occupational-demand-and-supply-outlook.pdf)  \nIt is therefore anticipated that the graduates of the PSS program will be in high demand. Moreover, the \ndual language skills of PSS graduates will be an asset that will be best utilized in those areas of Alberta \nwhere the French-speaking population is concentrated. \n2.3  Support \nProvide evidence of consultation with and approval/support from relevant professional organizations, \nregulatory bodies, advisory committees, employers, and/or industry. \nThis proposal benefits from strong support from internal and external stakeholders. \nDean Mocquais consulted with the Dean of the Faculty of Nursing as well as to the Health Sciences \nCouncil in regards to the implementation of this program.  Specific concerns voiced were about \nclinical placement opportunities.  CCA is working closely with Covenant Health   to secure placements \nhttp://employment.alberta.ca/documents/LMI/LMI-LMF_occ_demand_supply.pdf\nwhich in turn will meet a very specific need for qualified French-Speaking HCAs.  \nThe recently completed Market Study report found as a separate attachment as well as letters of \nsupport show the need for graduates of such a program as well as the availability of clinical \nplacements in francophone and bilingual sites.  Please find letters of support attached, Appendix 2.    \n2.4  Clinical or Work Experience \nIf clinical or work experience is an essential part of program delivery: \n2.4.1 Provide evidence that the placements will be available when needed. \nIt is expected that the graduates of the PSS program will be in high demand. With the prospect of a \nconsiderable increase in the aging population, the need for Health Care Aides and therefore the \nopportunities for placements will be increasing over the next year.   CCA has been working closely \nwith representatives of Covenant Health and an advisory committee to ensure that the placements are \navailable.   Please refer to letters of support for complementary information.  \n2.4.2 Describe the student’s role in securing placements. \nThe role of the student in securing placements will be to: \n• Provide a current Police Information Check with Vulnerable Sector Search and an up-to-date \nimmunization record prior to the first clinical practicum.     \n• Obtain a CPR Healthcare Provider Level Certificate which is often required by employers. \n• Meet other requirements as requested by the employer where the student will be placed. \n• Meet with potential off-site practicum supervisors as required. \n2.4.3 Explain how the institution will supervise/monitor the learning experience of students in off-site settings? \nThe Centre collégial de l’Alberta (CCA) will assign the monitoring of the student’s practicum learning \nexperience to one of its academic staff members who meets Alberta Health requirements for this role. \nThis coordinator will work jointly with healthcare providers directly supervising students to evaluate \nthe learning experience of each student. \n2.4.4 Identify potential employer/employee liability related to this aspect of the program, and how the institution \nintends to manage this liability. \nWhen in the off-site settings, students will be subject to all conditions that an employee would be \nsubjected to in this setting.  CCA representatives will work closely with on-site supervisors to ensure \nthat students and the work-place are aware of this condition and that all proper documentation is \nprovided. \nSECTION 3:  INSTITUTIONAL AND SYSTEM CONTEXT \n3.1  Institutional Strategy \nHow does the proposed program align with the institution’s strategic priorities and the Comprehensive \nInstitutional Plan? \nThe PSS program aligns with the University of Alberta’s new institutional strategic plan, For the \nPublic Good / Au Service de l’intérêt publique. One goal of the University of Alberta, as reflected in its \nstrategic planning is to connect with its communities, notably embracing and extending strengths such \nas la Francophonie at Campus Saint-Jean, so as to enhance the University’s interconnectedness with \nlocal communities. By drawing students from various Francophone communities as well as from the \ngeneral public, and preparing graduates to return to work environments in this milieu, the PSS program \nenhances this connectedness between the University of Alberta and Alberta and Western Canada’s \nFrancophonie and the growing interest for bilingualism (as manifested by enrollments in immersion \nprograms) in the general population. This program will enhance the University of Alberta’s reputation \nas a leader in French language postsecondary education West of Winnipeg. \nCampus Saint-Jean’s academic vision is based on a desire to become the Canadian institution that \ntrains the bilingual leaders in the social, economic, cultural and scientific fields from Alberta, Western \nCanada and elsewhere in order to best prepare them for their future role in the global village. To this \nend, CSJ’s objectives are to:  \n• Train responsible, committed citizens,  \n• Encourage excellence among our students \n• Promote a mix of social classes, cultures, experiences and values within the student population \n• Advance knowledge and encourage greater intellectual curiosity among students. \nThe PSS program fits with this vision by training students from various backgrounds to become \nknowledgeable workers who have critical thinking skills, who can deliver quality health services in \nboth official languages to all Albertans, and who are equipped to become leaders in their field.  \n3.2  Institutional Programs \nExplain how the proposed program fits with existing programs at the institution, and the anticipated positive or \nnegative impacts on other programs. \nThe common thread linking all programs at Campus Saint-Jean is the use of French as the language of \ninstruction to prepare bilingual professionals for the workplace.  There are absolutely no laddering \nopportunities between this program and the Baccalauréat bilingue, Sciences infirmières, the \ncollaborative program between Faculté Saint_Jean and Faculty of Nursing.  However, the CCA will be \nmoving forward with a proposal for a Practical Nurse program and there will be some laddering \nopportunities built in between these two programs.  \n3.3  Internal Review and Approval \nProvide a brief description of the internal review and approval process followed in developing the proposal. \nCentre collégial de l’Alberta has a specific UA internal review and approval process.  Please refer to \nAppendix 3 for further details.  Stated here are the specifics for this proposal:   \n• June 2016 :  Centre collégial de l’Alberta, Comité de planification de \nprogramme(recommendation for approval by Comité exécutif, CCA)   \n• June 2016 :  Centre collégial de l’Alberta Executive Committee (approval)  \n• October 2016:  Faculté Saint-Jean Faculty Council (for information only) \nhttps://d1pbog36rugm0t.cloudfront.net/-/media/isp/final-doc/12885-institutional-strategicplan-fr-final.pdf\nhttps://d1pbog36rugm0t.cloudfront.net/-/media/isp/final-doc/12885-institutional-strategicplan-fr-final.pdf\n• Consultation within University of Alberta Faculties and Departments \n• April 2017:  U of A General Faculty Council Academic Planning Committee(APC)   \n• U of A to forward proposal to Alberta Advanced Education once approved by APC. \n• Summer 2016: Letter requesting permission to use the provincial curriculum to be sent to \nAlberta Health (Appendix 4)   \n3.4  Campus Alberta Programs/Initiatives \nDiscuss the relationships (similarity, complementarity, transfer, competition) of the proposed program to other \nprograms or initiatives in Campus Alberta and explain what the proposed program would add to the system.  If \nthe proposed program would duplicate existing programs, explain why that duplication is warranted.   \nThe PSS certificate program will be part of Alberta’s postsecondary college level system, as are other \nHCA programs in Alberta. A number of publicly funded postsecondary educational institutions and \nprivate vocational training institutions in Alberta offer diploma HCA programs.  \nThe content and learning outcomes of the proposed PSS diploma program mirror those of the HCA \nprogram currently being offered in most institutions in Alberta. The learning outcomes have been \nvalidated by and approved by Alberta Health Services, who has developed a standard curriculum for \nHealth Care Aide training that is offered by post-secondary education institutions throughout the \nprovince. \nAll existing programs offered in Alberta and across Western Canada are presently offered only in \nEnglish.  Most of the teaching in CCA’s program will be done in French; however, the required \ntextbook will be Mosby’s Canadian Textbook for the Support Worker (in English).  Also, some of the \npracticum work will be done in English and almost always in an English speaking setting.  The PSS \nprogram is unique and distinct in that it will provide opportunity to students to develop workplace \nskills and knowledge in French as well as English. The cohort graduating from the PSS program will \ntherefore be bilingual health care professionals. \n3.5  Consultation \nSummarize the type and outcomes of consultations with other institutions offering related programs. Attach \ncopies of relevant documents (e.g. letters, meeting summaries).  Discuss the potential for inter-institutional \ncollaboration.   \nPast discussions have been held between Campus St-Jean (Centre collégial de l’Alberta) \nrepresentatives and Bow Valley College.  Discussions were also held with NorQuest College but did \nnot result in a partnership for delivery because of the requirements of the federal funding agencies and \nHealth Canada.  CCA/CSJ is in the best position to liaise with the Francophone community and with \nFrench speakers at large in every corner of the province. Obtaining a license to offer this program is \ntherefore critical. \n3.6  Learner Pathways \n3.6.1 Identify potential pathways from work to school (where applicable). \nThe proposed PSS program will be open to students coming directly from high school as well as to \nstudents looking to diversify their career opportunities or reorient their career after working for few \nyears. Because the proposed program will be less than one year in length, it will favor a rapid career \ntransition without a prolonged absence from the workforce. Applicants to this program will be able to \nuse   CCA’s PLAR process should it be required.(See Appendix for details) \n3.6.2 Identify potential opportunities for transfer/laddering into the proposed program from other institutions or \nother programs within the institution; and for transfer/laddering from the proposed program to other \nprograms within the institution or at other institutions.  List any formal agreements for internal or inter-\ninstitutional transfer/laddering that have been negotiated to this point. \nThere are opportunities to further study within the field, notably to follow a Licensed Practical Nurse \nprogram through completion of two years of additional education.  Laddering opportunities are \navailable through various Alberta institutions who offer this program.   \n3.6.3 Estimate the portion of graduates who can be expected to proceed to further education directly. At a later \nstage in their careers.  What types of programs/credentials would they be most likely to pursue?   \nAt this point, we are estimating the portion of graduates expected to proceed to further education is \nfairly low. * \nSECTION 4:  FINANCIAL VIABILITY AND SUSTAINABILITY \n4.1  Annual Budget and Funding Sources \nIdentify annual and one-time expenditures and annual revenue for the program in the budget tables below.  If \nprogram implementation will take place over more than one year, provide estimates for each year until full \nimplementation.  Provide explanatory notes for all budget assumptions, such as inflation and per student tuition. \n(For proposals without significant impacts on institutional costs, revenues or enrolment, a detailed budget presentation will \nnot normally be required (please confirm with the department).  Such proposals will satisfy all of the following tests: \n1. The proposal is for a new specialization in an existing program, consisting of an innovative combination of existing \ncurricula. \n2.

Rates for Canadian \nstudents are slightly lower than, for example at NorQuest($2800.00). UA mandatory non-instructional \nfees are significantly higher than in other institutions offering this certificate program (NorQuest: \n$986). \n4.2.2 Discuss the financial impact on students and the learner funding system, taking into account the costs of \neducation and the potential debt burden relative to post-graduation earning capacity. \nFunding options by way of student loans for Alberta students and student bursaries provided by the \nCCA and various endowment funds will be available to students.  Since this is a one year program, the \nfinancial burden is lower than other programs and is in line with post-graduation earning capacity and \nwork-force hiring capacity. \n4.2.3 If program funding includes internal reallocation, evaluate the impact of this reallocation on the \ninstitution’s operations and overall financial position. \nBecause of small class numbers and the relative number of students expected in the proposed program \ncompared to the total number of students at CSJ (about 2%), it is anticipated that, for the time being, \nthe impact on Student Services and space at CSJ will be absorbed. The impact of the long term \ndevelopment of the program will need to be reassessed.    \nSECTION 5:  QUALITY ASSESSMENT \n5.1 Institutional Capacity \n5.1.1 List instructional positions that would support the proposed program, specifying position title, credential \nand experience requirements, and areas of expertise.  Distinguish between new and existing positions; \nand regular and sessional appointments.  Describe mechanisms (existing and planned) to develop and \nensure currency of teaching skills and disciplinary expertise. \nThe instructional positions necessary to offer the program will be equivalent to one and a half full-time \npositions for the period of instruction.  Given the nature of CCA staffing, these will be CAS:T \nmembers and be full-time and part-time sessional lecturers.    In order to meet Alberta Health criteria \nfor licensing, CCA has already identified an LPN and an RN who are both working on the overall \npreparation for implementation. These two individuals have the language skills, the expertise and the \nexperience to teach in the program. CSJ will seek instructional staff with the best expertise and \nlanguage skills to provide quality instruction and will give preference to instructors with clinical \nexperience.   \n5.1.2 List instructional support positions (e.g. lab technicians, tutors) related to the proposed program.  \nTo date, no need for instructional support positions are expected. \n5.1.3 Describe facilities, equipment and information resources (existing and planned) that would house and \nsupport delivery of the proposed program. \nBecause of the small class size, it is anticipated that there will not be a significant impact on \ninfrastructure at CSJ, including library, computer labs, student services, etc.  \n5.1.4 Discuss the anticipated impacts of the proposed program on student support services. \nBecause of the low number of students, it is anticipated that there will not be a significant impact on \nstudent support services at the Campus Saint-Jean which is hosting about 700 students this 2016 Fall \nterm. Students in the PSS program will participate in Student Services to the same degree as CSJ \nuniversity-level students. \n5.2 Curriculum  \nDescribe the process of development and validation of curriculum for the proposed program.

Recognized as Canada’s largest social enterprise, we employ 8,000 people who \nspread hope and happiness through 18,000 care exchanges daily. Since 2014, we have been \nworking with Covenant Care to provide direct care services at Saint-Thomas Health Centre. \nSaint-Thomas has 200-units and is committed to meeting the health care needs of the \nEdmonton francophone community.  \nAs the population ages and the demand for health and social care services continues to grow, \nthe availability of qualified, well-trained Health Care Aides is vital to meeting the needs of \nAlberta’s French speaking population.  As a leader in person and family centred care, Saint \nElizabeth is committed to providing exceptional care through a holistic approach that meets \nthe unique linguistic, cultural and health needs of the people and communities we serve.  \nUniversity of Alberta Campus Saint-Jean is a leader in bilingual education, and as such, is \nwell situated to train bilingual and French-speaking Health Care Aides.  We wish you great \nsuccess and look forward to hearing more about the program.  \nSincerely,   \nRheta Fanizza  \nChief Business Officer & Senior Vice President, Innovation  \nSaint Elizabeth  \nCc: Paul Denis Board Chair, Community Board, Saint Thomas Health Centre  \n90 Allstate Parkway, Suite 300  \nMarkham, ON L3R 6H3  \nT 905.940.9655  \nF 905.940.9934  \nwww.saintelizabeth.com  \n    To support our charitable programs, please visit our website.  \nMay 29th. 2016 \nMme Nisrine Mokri \nDirector of Health Programs  \nFaculty Service Officer \nCampus Saint-Jean, U of A \nI want to personally support the creation of a Health Care Aide Program at \nCampus Saint-Jean. Such a program would be welcomed by the francophone \ncommunity as the need for Health Care Aides has become evident over the past \nfew years and it will continue to grow at a rapid pace.  \nIn a publication prepared by the Francophone Seniors Federation of Alberta \npublished in 2012, the following statistics on the francophone population of \nAlberta was reported. Most of this information comes from Statistics Canada. \nThere are 68,500 Albertans whose first language is French.  \nEdmonton accounts for 42% or 28,700 Francophones.  \nSt-Paul/Bonnyville has 8% or 5,500 Francophones. \nPeace River area has also 8% or 5,500 Francophones. \nAccording to statistics Canada the Baby Boomer population will almost double \nbetween 2011 and 2036, going from 14% to 24% of the general population. \nHowever the Francophone group has a higher number of seniors per capita \nthan the general population.  \nIn Edmonton alone the Francophone seniors will number 6,900 people. If we \nadd the numbers from St-Paul/Bonnyville and Peace River, an additional 2,600 \npeople, the total number of francophone seniors is close to 10,000. Many will be \nlooking for continuing care health services in French. \nSome 15% to 20% of these people will require supportive living services. \nConservatively, as many as 1,300 seniors from Edmonton are potential clients \nfor the St-Thomas Health Center operated by Covenant Care, situated across \nthe street from Campus Saint-Jean. Add an uncertain number from areas North \nof Edmonton and Calgary and this number could be as many as 2,000.  \nEdmonton has seen its francophone population increase considerably with \nimmigration from French speaking African countries. The needs for continuing \ncare will become more evident as this population grows older. It would be \nimportant to find students from these countries registered in this Health Care \nAide Program.  \nGraduates from the Campus Saint-Jean Health Care Aide Program could find \nemployment immediately at the St-Thomas Health Care Center which could \nalso provide practicums for the students.   \nThis is an exciting situation which can lead to the creation of a great example of \nhealth care that meets the needs of a growing population, taking into account \nthe need for linguistically & culturally adapted health care.  \nIt would also highlight the contribution to the francophone community of the \nUniversity of Alberta Campus Saint-Jean. The francophone community created \nCollège Saint-Jean, now part of the U of A, now known as Campus St. Jean. It \nis fitting that the University provide this program which would meet an ever more \nimportant need in the francophone community.  \nAs President of the Community Board of St-Thomas Health Center, I can \nconfirm the unreserved support of all the members of our board. St-Thomas \nalso houses close to 100 francophone seniors who occupy apartments in the \nindependent living area. These people would like to know that when the time \ncomes, should they need supportive living services, they will have access to \nqualified and well trained Health Care Aides. It would bring great comfort to \nthem if we could tell them that Campus Saint-Jean will soon be offering a \nprogram that will meet that need.  \nAlso, the Calgary area has a considerable number of francophone seniors who \nneed or will need supportive living health care services over the next decade \nand more. Trained health care aids graduating from Campus Saint-Jean may \nvery well be able to fill positions in all parts of Alberta wherever the need is \nmanifest.    \nShould you require more information or assistance in promoting the Health Care \nAide Program at Campus Saint-Jean, please do not hesitate to communicate \nwith me at your convenience. \nRegards; \nPaul Denis \nPresident \nCommunity Board \nSt-Thomas Health Center     \nAppendix D :  Prior Learning Assessment and Recognition  \nPréposé aux soins de santé(PSS), Prior Learning Assessment and Recognition(PLAR) \nThe PSS PLAR process is a certification process for individuals who have had directly related \ncontinuing care work experience in the past three years but do not currently have a certificate that is \nrecognized I Alberta.  These would include: \n1.  individuals who have been working as a nursing attendant or personal support worker, but do \nnot have a certificate currently recognized in Alberta.  \n2. nurses or nursing attendants trained in another country who have experience in geriatric care \nand believe they have the skills and knowledge to meet the standards for the CCA  Préposé \naux soins de santé certificate. \nIndividuals requesting that their prior experiences be recognized, they must    \n1. meet the Admission Requirements for the PSS certificate program and   \n2. have 600 hours of experience in the last 3 years as a healthcare worker.  These must be \ndocumented with a proof-of-employment letter from the employer(s). \nOnce individuals have been approved for the PSS PLAR process, they will receive an individualized \nlearner plan.    The CCA’s PSS qualified staff will evaluate the profile of each individual requesting \nadmission to the PSS PLAR certificate.  All candidates will take the following mandatory course:  \nPSSTC 120  Prodiguer des soins aux clients.   \nDepending on their individualized plan, candidates may challenge the other courses in the program \nwhile taking the mandatory courses.  \nClasses will be offered in a hybrid online model including face to face classes and labs.   \nAppendix F : Market Analysis Report by Axion \n UNIVERSITY AND COLLEGE \nPROGRAMS IN HEALTH  \nMarch 2016 \nMARKET STUDY PREPARED FOR CAMPUS SAINT-JEAN \nOttawa, ON \nTel.: 613-369-4333 \nwww.axionplus.biz \n MARKET STUDY: UNIVERSITY AND COLLEGE PROGRAMS IN HEALTH  2  \n FINAL REPORT – MARCH 2016 \nPROJECT COORDINATION: Axion  \nPROJECT ADVISORS: \nDenis Fontaine, Campus Saint-Jean  \nDolorèse Nolette, Campus Saint-Jean  \nThis study was conducted in cooperation with the Campus Saint-Jean component of the Consortium national \nde formation en santé (national health education consortium). \nMARKET STUDY: UNIVERSITY AND COLLEGE PROGRAMS IN HEALTH  3  \nFINAL REPORT – MARCH 2016 \nTABLE OF CONTENTS  \n PAGE  \nI.

SUMMARY \nCampus Saint-Jean is studying the possibility of creating eight new college and university programs to \ntrain Francophone and bilingual professionals in the health sector.  \nThe market study targets the health service needs of Francophones in relation to each proposed program. \nParticular attention is paid to the college Health Care Aide program.  \nThere are three distinct elements to the methodology used in carrying out this study, namely demographic \nresearch regarding Francophones in Alberta, consultation with the province’s Francophone communities, \nand a market study for eight distinct college and university programs. \nDemographic data \nAccording to the 2011 National Household Survey, Francophones represent 2.1% of the total population of \nAlberta, or 74,075 people whose first official language spoken (FOLS) is French.  \nBetween 2006 and 2011, the population of Alberta with French as their first official language spoken \nincreased by 10.6%, from 67,000 to 74,074 people. In 10 years (2001-2011), the population of Alberta with \nFrench as their first official language spoken increased by 19.5%, or 12,070 people. The sharp increase in \nthe number of people with French as their first official language spoken is explained in large part by the \narrival of recent immigrants whose first official language spoken was French. In fact, three out of four new \nresidents of Alberta (76.7%) with French as their first official language spoken were recent immigrants who \narrived in Canada between 2001 and 2011. \nThe Francophone population of Alberta is older than the province’s population. In fact, 27.8% of \nFrancophones were 55 or older in 2011, compared to 21% of the population as a whole. As well, according \nto the 2006 census by Statistics Canada, 80% of Francophone seniors aged 65 and over were located in \nfour census divisions: 42% in the Edmonton metropolitan area, 22% in the greater Calgary area, 8% in \nnortheastern region, and 8% in the northwest.  \nThis situation could have an impact on the demand for health services over the short, medium and long \nterms. In fact, several Canadian and international studies show a sharp decline in the second language \nlearned (in this case English) among seniors after their retirement. Moreover, studies clearly show that, in \nstressful situations, seniors tend to turn to their mother tongue. Finally, seniors with a cognitive disability \nsuch as dementia gradually lose their ability to communicate in the second language learned. \nAnother characteristic of the Francophone population in Alberta is the sharp rise in the number of \nFrancophone immigrants who arrived in the province between 2001 and 2011. It must be noted that 41% of \nvery recent immigrants have indicated only French as their first official language spoken. In general, \nimmigrants who arrive in Canada are in relatively good health. However, several studies note that the \nhealth of immigrants tends to deteriorate.  \nConsultations with Francophone communities  \n22 NOMBRE DE JEUNES INSCRITS À UN PROGRAMME D’IMMERSION FRANÇAISE 107 \n23 RECOMMANDATIONS DES PROGRAMMES 108 \nMARKET STUDY: UNIVERSITY AND COLLEGE PROGRAMS IN HEALTH  8 \n FINAL REPORT – MARCH 2016 \nIn order to identify the need for Francophone and bilingual labour to better serve Francophone \ncommunities in Alberta in terms of health care, consultations were organized in four regions (Calgary, \nEdmonton, Northeast and Northwest). A total of 68 people participated in the 6 consultations. \nA discussion template with four main questions was prepared to gather the same information from the \nvarious communities:  \n Health services currently available in French; \n Health services that should be available as a priority in French; \n The relevance of creating a health care aide program; \n The order of priority for the programs previously identified. \nIn light of the profile of the Francophone population and the results obtained from the consultations, the \nproject managers selected five college programs and three university programs, for which Axion \ndeveloped targeted market studies.  \nCollege Programs University programs \n Health care aide (NOC 3413)  Nurse practitioner (NOC 3152) \n Licensed practical nurse (NOC 3233)  Psychologist (NOC 4151) \n Mental health worker (NOC 4212)  Dietitian (NOC 3132)  \n Emergency medical personnel (NOC 3234)  \n Speech language assistant (NOC 3235)  \nCollege program – Health care aide \nIn Alberta, 31,083 people were working as nurse aides, orderlies and patient service associates as of \nDecember 31, 2014, making that category of profession the second largest in the number of employees in \nthe province’s health sector.  \nGiven the average age of 44 for nurse aides, orderlies and patient service associates (NOC 3413), \nretirements are expected to increase considerably over the next few years. \nAccording to data from the Alberta Learning Information Service, obtained through the 2013 Alberta Wage \nand Salary Survey, 40% of employers seeking to hire health care aides had difficulty finding employees and \n12% still had positions available after 4 months. According to the data, the vacancy rate for health care \naides was at 4% in 2013.  \nAll respondents believe that there will be a moderate expansion of the job market for graduates from a \nFrancophone or bilingual health care aide program over the next five to seven years. Although health \nagencies that hire these professionals are not seeking bilingual personnel, the demand for health care \naides will continue to increase, as health professionals are ageing and retiring and the Francophone \npopulation is continuing to age. As well, it is very difficult to find Francophone or bilingual health care \naides.  \nLike everywhere else in Canada, the profession of health care aide is not regulated in Alberta. Educational \ninstitutions issue a certificate to attest to the student’s success, but there is no final program examination. \nMARKET STUDY: UNIVERSITY AND COLLEGE PROGRAMS IN HEALTH  9  \nFINAL REPORT – MARCH 2016 \nHowever, in 2001, Alberta Health established a competency profile for health care aides. An updated \ncompetency profile should be released in 2016.  \nAt this time, the program is offered by a large number of private institutions, community colleges and \nemployers certified by the province. No institution offers the health care aide program in French.  \nIn the other western provinces, two programs are offered in French: a health care aid certificate at \nUniversité de Saint-Boniface and the distance and classroom resident care attendant program from \nÉducacentre College. According to Éducacentre College’s website, its program is not recognized by the \nGovernment of Alberta, unlike the vast majority of programs offered by private and public institutions in \nAlberta.  \nGiven the promising number of positions for health care aides that will be created in the province over the \nnext few years, the high percentage of elderly Francophones in Alberta (primarily in Edmonton and the \nnortheast and northwest of the province), the difficulty finding bilingual health care aides at this time, the \ninterest of new Francophone immigrants in taking such training, and the lack of French-language training \nprograms approved by the Province of Alberta that are offered in the province or elsewhere in the West, \nAxion recommends that Campus Saint-Jean create a health care aide program to be offered in French. \nCollege program – Licensed practical nurse \nIn Alberta, 13,915 people were working as licensed practical nurses as of December 31, 2015. That \nprofession grew by 51% between 2009 and 2014. At this time, 5.3% of licensed practical nurses working in \nthe province obtained their diploma abroad. \nAccording to data from the Alberta Learning Information Service, obtained through the 2013 Alberta Wage \nand Salary Survey, 23% of employers seeking to hire licensed practical nurses had difficulty finding \nemployees and 6% still had positions available after 4 months.  \nAlmost all respondents believe that there will be a moderate expansion of the job market for graduates \nfrom a Francophone or bilingual licensed practical nurse program over the next five to seven years. \nRespondents indicated that the greatest demand for licensed practical nurses would be from hospitals, \nlong-term care facilities, and Primary Care Networks. To a lesser degree, community centres and home \ncare services could also recruit licensed practical nurses. \nIn Alberta, the profession of licensed practical nurse is regulated by the Health Professions Act and the \nLicensed Practical Nurses Profession Regulation. To exercise the profession, a licensed practical nurse must \nhave successfully completed a training program approved by the Education Standards Advisory \nCommittee, a committee of the College of Licensed Practical Nurses of Alberta (CLPNA), and have passed \nthe Canadian Practical Nurse Registration examination administered by the CLPNA.  \nAt this time, 10 colleges offer a licensed practical nurse program in English across the province. No \ninstitution offers the licensed practical nurse program in French. Only one program is offered in French in \nWestern Canada, in Winnipeg. However, it seems that that program is not recognized by the College of \nLicensed Practical Nurses of Alberta.  \nGiven the promising forecasts regarding the number of positions for licensed practical nurses that will be \ncreated in the province over the next few years, the high percentage of elderly Francophones in Alberta \n(primarily in Edmonton and the northeast and northwest of the province), the difficulty finding bilingual \nMARKET STUDY: UNIVERSITY AND COLLEGE PROGRAMS IN HEALTH  10 \n FINAL REPORT – MARCH 2016 \nlicensed practical nurses at this time, the interest of new Francophone immigrants in taking such training, \nand the lack of French-language training programs approved by the CLPNA that are offered in the province \nor elsewhere in the West, Axion recommends that Campus Saint-Jean create a licensed practical nurse \nprogram to be offered in French. \nCollege program – Mental health worker \nIn 2013, more than 12,000 people were working as social and community service workers (NOC 4212) in \nAlberta. Job prospects are above average. This group is expected to see growth of 3.3% per year by 2017. It \nis expected that 396 positions for social and community service workers will be created each year, in \naddition to the positions that will become available due to changes in positions, promotions or \nretirements.  \nAccording to data from the Alberta Learning Information Service, obtained through the 2013 Alberta Wage \nand Salary Survey, 29% of employers seeking to hire mental health workers had difficulty finding \nemployees and 6% still had positions available after 4 months.  \nMost respondents believe that there will be a sharp or moderate expansion of the job market for graduates \nfrom a Francophone or bilingual mental health worker program over the next five to seven years. \nRespondents indicated that the greatest demand for mental health workers would be from the educational \nsector, community health centres and Primary Care Networks.  \nThe profession of mental health worker is not regulated in Alberta. The qualifications for mental health \nworkers can vary considerably. Some are nurses, some are psychologists, and some are social workers.  \nNo college in Alberta offers a mental health worker program as such. Four institutions offer a community \nservice worker or community support worker program, which seems similar at first glance to the mental \nhealth worker program found in other provinces. No French-language or bilingual institutions offer such a \nprogram in French in Western Canada.  \nGiven the promising forecasts regarding the number of positions for social and community service workers \nthat will be created in the province over the next few years, the high percentage of Francophone seniors in \nAlberta (primarily in Edmonton and the northeast and northwest of the province), the high percentage of \nnew immigrants who speak only French as their first official language and who have recently arrived in \nlarge centres such as Calgary and Edmonton, the difficulty finding bilingual mental health workers at this \ntime, the increased social awareness of mental health problems, and the lack of this type of training \nprogram in French in Alberta and Western Canada, Axion recommends that Campus Saint-Jean create a \nmental health worker program to be offered in French. \nMoreover, given that no training programs for mental health workers are currently offered in English in \nAlberta or in Western Canada, we recommend further reflection be undertaken with potential employers \n(school boards, clinics, etc.) to find the exact name of the French-language program. \nCollege program – Emergency medical personnel \nIn Alberta, on December 31, 2015, there were 3,843 EMRs, 4,259 EMTs, and 2,579 EMT-Ps, for a total of \n10,681 professionals. Between 2009 and 2013, growth in this profession varied widely based on the level of \nMARKET STUDY: UNIVERSITY AND COLLEGE PROGRAMS IN HEALTH  11  \nFINAL REPORT – MARCH 2016 \nqualification of personnel. Growth was very high for technicians and technologists, while it was rather low \nfor medical responders.  \nAccording to data from the Alberta Learning Information Service, obtained through the 2013 Alberta Wage \nand Salary Survey, 37% of employers seeking to hire emergency medical personnel and paramedics had \ndifficulty finding employees and 19% still had positions available after 4 months. According to the data, the \nvacancy rate for emergency medical personnel and paramedics was at 3% in 2013.  \nRespondents indicated that there will be a sharp or moderate expansion of the job market for graduates \nfrom an emergency medical personnel or paramedic staff program over the next five to seven years. The \ngreatest demand will be for EMR paramedic staff. The number of graduates is not sufficient to keep up the \ngrowth in this sector and to replace departures. Respondents indicated that the greatest demand for these \nprofessionals would be from the private sector, Alberta Health and the industrial sector. One respondent \nindicated that the region of Girouxville, McLennan and Clare had needs for Francophone or bilingual \nemergency medical personnel or paramedics. According to the respondents, there is a high demand for \nambulance transport for seniors who do not have a car, particularly in rural areas. \nIn Alberta, the profession of emergency medical personnel and paramedics is regulated by the Alberta \nCollege of Paramedics. To be recognized as an EMR, EMT or EMT-P, emergency medical personnel must \nhave successfully completed a training program that meets Alberta College of Paramedics standards and \nmust pass Alberta College of Paramedics written and practical exams within one year.  \nSeveral programs are offered in Alberta to train emergency medical personnel (EMR, EMT and EMT-P). \nEleven institutions offer the EMR program approved by the Alberta College of Paramedics, seven offer the \nEMT certificate program, and five offer the EMT-P diploma program. No French-language or bilingual \ninstitutions offer these programs in French in Western Canada.  \nGiven the promising forecasts regarding the number of positions for emergency medical personnel and \nparamedics that will be created in the province over the next few years, the high percentage of elderly \nFrancophones in Alberta (primarily in Edmonton and the northeast and northwest of the province), the \ndifficulty finding emergency medical personnel and paramedics at this time, and the lack of French-\nlanguage training programs that are offered in Alberta and Western Canada, Axion recommends that \nCampus Saint-Jean create a training program for emergency medical personnel and paramedics to be \noffered in French and approved by the Alberta College of Paramedics. \nThe programs that seem most interesting are the certificate programs (Emergency Medical Technician – \nEmergency medical personnel or EMT) and diploma programs (Emergency Medical Technologist - \nParamedic or EMT-P).  \nCollege program – Speech language assistant \nIn 2013, more than 2,900 people were working in the Other Technical Occupations in Therapy and \nAssessment category (NOC 3235). Job prospects are above average and this group is expected to grow by \n3.2% per year by 2017.  \nAccording to data from the Alberta Learning Information Service, obtained through the 2013 Alberta Wage \nand Salary Survey, more than two thirds (68%) of employers seeking to hire technical personnel in therapy \nand assessment had difficulty finding employees and more than one third (39%) still had positions \nMARKET STUDY: UNIVERSITY AND COLLEGE PROGRAMS IN HEALTH  12 \n FINAL REPORT – MARCH 2016 \navailable after 4 months. The vacancy rate for technical personnel in therapy and assessment was at 14% in \n2013. \nMost respondents believe that there will be a sharp or moderate expansion of the job market for graduates \nfrom a speech language assistant program over the next five to seven years. Respondents indicated that \nthe greatest demand for speech language assistants would be from the educational sector, hospitals, \nrehabilitation centres, daycares, the preschool sector, and home care programs.  \nThe profession of speech language assistant is not regulated in Alberta. Speech language assistants can \nobtain voluntary accreditation from the Therapy Assistant Association of Alberta if they obtain their \ndiploma from a program recognized by the Association and if they have worked as a speech language \nassistant for at least 3,000 hours in three years.  \nAt this time in Alberta, only two colleges offer a speech language assistant program that is recognized by \nthe Therapy Assistant Association of Alberta. One is in Edmonton and the other in Medicine Hat. No \nFrench-language or bilingual institutions offer such a program in French in Western Canada.  \nGiven the promising forecasts regarding the number of positions in the category of Other Technical \nOccupations in Therapy and Assessment (NOC 3235) that will be created in the province over the next few \nyears, the high percentage of Francophone seniors in Alberta (primarily in Edmonton and the northeast \nand northwest of the province), the high percentage of new immigrants who speak only French as their \nfirst official language and who have recently arrived in large centres such as Calgary and Edmonton, the \ndifficulty finding Francophone speech language assistants at this time, and the lack of training programs in \nFrench in Alberta and Western Canada, Axion recommends that Campus Saint-Jean create an speech \nlanguage assistant program to be offered in French. \nGiven that the pool of jobs for Francophone speech language assistants is nonetheless limited in Alberta \nand Western Canada, it is recommended that the program include courses on language development in \nEnglish and on the phonology of both languages so graduates are able to work in French and in English.  \nUniversity program – Nurse practitioner \nAs of December 31, 2015, there were 491 nurse practitioners in Alberta. However, this group of \nprofessionals grew by 52.6% between 2009 and 2014.  \nAccording to the professional nurse practitioners associations, the lack of funding makes it difficult to hire \nnurse practitioners in primary care. Other barriers cited by the professional associations are federal and \nprovincial laws. \nMost respondents believe that there will be a sharp or moderate expansion of the job market for graduates \nfrom a nurse practitioner program over the next five to seven years. One respondent felt that there would \nonly be low expansion in this area because, in his opinion, the province does not support the use of this \ntype of professional. Moreover, according to that respondent, 75% of nurse practitioners in the province do \nnot do the work for which they were trained.  \nMARKET STUDY: UNIVERSITY AND COLLEGE PROGRAMS IN HEALTH  13  \nFINAL REPORT – MARCH 2016 \nRespondents indicated that most demand for nurse practitioners would be from hospitals and long-term \ncare centres. Four out of the seven respondents also indicated their interest in hiring a total of 11.5 \nfull-time nurse practitioners and 1 part-time nurse practitioner in the next three years.  \nThe occupation of nurse practitioner in Alberta requires certification as a registered nurse in Alberta or \nanother province or territory, successful completion of a program approved by the Nurse Practitioner \nAssociation of Alberta or a similar program recognized elsewhere in Canada, and a passing mark on the \nAlberta nurse practitioner accreditation exam. \nAt this time in Alberta, only three universities offer a nurse practitioner program in English. No \nFrench-language or bilingual institutions offer such a program in French in Western Canada.  \nIt is difficult to predict the growth in this sector due to the small number of nurse practitioners within the \nlarger category of registered nurses. As well, graduates have difficulty working in their field of expertise \nand there is a lack of provincial funding for hiring this type of professional. Moreover, the sampling of \nemployers interviewed is limited and Axion was unable to obtain information from hospital human \nresource departments. We must also consider the interest shown in this type of profession among the \npeople interviewed (possible creation of 11.5 nurse practitioner positions over three years) and the lack of \ntraining programs in French in Alberta and Western Canada. Therefore, Axion recommends that Campus \nSaint-Jean study the market further before making a decision to create a French or bilingual nurse \npractitioner program. \nUniversity program – Psychologist  \nAs of December 31, 2015, there were 2,628 psychologists in Alberta. This group of professionals grew by \n13.8% between 2009 and 2014. As of December 31, 2015, the average age of psychologists was 49, and \n54.6% were 50 or younger. Just over 45% of psychologists (1,192) will be of retirement age in the next five \nyears.  \nAccording to data from the Alberta Learning Information Service, obtained through the 2013 Alberta Wage \nand Salary Survey, 38% of employers seeking to hire psychologists had difficulty finding employees and \n9% still had positions available after 4 months. The vacancy rate for psychologist positions was at 3% in \n2013. \nAll respondents believe that there will be a sharp or moderate expansion of the job market for graduates \nfrom a psychology program over the next five to seven years. The respondents indicated that the greatest \ndemand for psychologists will be from private practices, schools, mental health centres, hospitals and crisis \nlines. Four out of the seven respondents also indicated their interest in hiring a total of nine full-time \npsychologists in the next three years. The representative from the Psychologists’ Association of Alberta \nindicated receiving frequent requests for Francophone psychologists.  \nThe occupation of psychologist in Alberta requires accreditation from the College of Alberta Psychologists \n(CAP). To obtain accreditation, the person must have a master’s degree in psychology that meets CAP \nacademic criteria, have worked at least 1,600 hours under the supervision of an accredited psychologist \nrecognized by CAP, and have passed an exam in clinical or theoretical psychology approved by CAP.  \nAlberta and Quebec are the only provinces where a psychologist can practice the profession with a \nmaster’s degree and not a doctorate. At this time, six universities offer a master’s program in psychology. \nMARKET STUDY: UNIVERSITY AND COLLEGE PROGRAMS IN HEALTH  14 \n FINAL REPORT – MARCH 2016 \nFour are Alberta universities, while the other two are foreign universities. No French-language or bilingual \ninstitutions offer such a program in French in Western Canada.  \nGiven the promising forecasts regarding the number of psychologist positions that will be created in the \nprovince over the next few years, the large number of psychologists who will be of retirement age in the \nnext five years, the high percentage of Francophone seniors in Alberta (primarily in Edmonton and the \nnortheast and northwest of the province), the high percentage of new immigrants who speak only French \nas their first official language and who have recently arrived in large centres such as Calgary and \nEdmonton, the difficulty finding Francophone psychologists at this time, and the lack of training programs \nin French in Alberta and Western Canada, Axion recommends that Campus Saint-Jean create a master \nof psychology program. \nUniversity program – Dietitian  \nAs of December 31, 2015, there were 1,238 dietitians in Alberta. This group of professionals grew by 23.8% \nbetween 2009 and 2014. As of December 31, 2015, the average age of dietitians was 39, making it a very \nyoung profession; 80.9% of dietitians were 50 or younger.  \nThe Alberta Learning Information Service has no statistics regarding the predicted growth rate for the \nprofession over the next few years. However, according to the health and social services industry profile \nprepared by the Government of Alberta in 2015, this sector is expected to continue growing at an average \nrate of 3% per year between 2015 and 2019. That rate will be greater than the average growth of the other \nsectors of the Alberta economy.  \nAlmost all respondents believe that there will be a sharp or moderate expansion of the job market for \ngraduates from a dietitian program over the next five to seven years.  \nRespondents indicated that the greatest demand for dietitians will be from Primary Care Networks, \nhospitals, retirement homes, mental health centres, long-term care facilities, home care programs, private \npractices, and community health centres.  \nTo work as a dietitian in Alberta, accreditation is required from the College of Dietitians of Alberta (CDA). \nTo obtain accreditation, the person must have a bachelor or master’s degree in food sciences or nutrition \napproved by the CDA, have completed an internship of 35 to 40 weeks in an accredited Canadian \ninternship program, under the supervision of an accredited dietitian, and have passed the Canadian \nDietetic Registration Examination. \nIn Alberta, only the University of Alberta offers a Nutrition and Food Sciences program accredited by the \nCDA. It is also the only university to offer an integrated internship program recognized by the CDA. No \ninstitutions offer such a program in French in the province or in Western Canada.  \nGiven the growth seen in this profession between 2009 and 2014 and the expansion anticipated by \nrespondents to the survey over the next few years, the increase in health problems due to obesity and the \nincreased use of dietitian services to prevent and treat health problems, the high percentage of \nFrancophone seniors in Alberta (primarily in Edmonton and the northeast and northwest of the province), \nthe high percentage of obese people in the North, the high percentage of new immigrants who speak only \nFrench as their first official language and who have recently arrived in large centres such as Calgary and \nEdmonton, the difficulty finding Francophone dietitians at this time, and the lack of training programs in \nMARKET STUDY: UNIVERSITY AND COLLEGE PROGRAMS IN HEALTH  15  \nFINAL REPORT – MARCH 2016 \nFrench in Alberta and Western Canada, Axion recommends that Campus Saint-Jean create a bachelor of \nnutrition program. \nPool of potential students \nA study of the pool of potential students shows that 20,889 young students are currently studying in \nFrench in the provinces and territories of Western Canada, in addition to the 302,849 attending immersion \nschools in the same area.  \nThere is a large market for Campus Saint-Jean. However, to attract them, the institution must adopt \nquality programs in accordance with industry standards. The programs must also be presented in an \ninnovative manner in order to meet the needs of Francophone students throughout Alberta and elsewhere \nin the West and North. Competition is fierce. Youth have a wide choice of programs and institutions. \nCampus Saint-Jean must position itself as a hub for health programs in French in Western and Northern \nCanada.  \nMARKET STUDY: UNIVERSITY AND COLLEGE PROGRAMS IN HEALTH  16 \n FINAL REPORT – MARCH 2016 \n1. PRESENTATION OF THE STUDY \n1.1 BACKGROUND  \nCampus Saint-Jean is studying the possibility of creating eight new college and university programs to \ntrain Francophone and bilingual professionals in the health sector.  \nAt this time, Campus Saint-Jean does not offer any health programs at the college level, but offers a \nbilingual Bachelor of Science in Nursing and a Postgraduate Certificate in Francophone Practice for Speech \nlanguage therapists. \nThe market study targets the health service needs of Francophones in relation to each proposed program. \nParticular attention is paid to the college Health care aide program.  \nBefore making a decision to launch new programs, it is essential that Campus Saint-Jean rely on solid data. \nThe educational institution wishes to: \n Identify the major health needs of Francophones; \n Determine the job market demand for new college and university programs to train health care \nprofessionals; \n Analyze and interpret the data regarding job market demand in order to make informed decisions \nregarding the creation of possible programs. \nIn particular, Campus Saint-Jean wishes to determine: \n The health needs of Francophones; \n The characteristics of the work; \n The size of the job market; \n The size of the target market; \n The nature of the competition; \n A description of similar programs in the Western provinces and elsewhere in Canada; \n Demographic data; \n Trends; \n Educational needs in this area; \n Job prospects; \n Areas of application and opportunities for future graduates; \n Prospects for clinical internships; \n Accreditation and certification requirements; \n Francophone prospects in a minority setting. \nThe project includes a full market analysis, based on the following approach: \n Analysis of the health needs of Francophones \n Analysis of the job market \n Study of the competition from other educational institutions across Canada \n Interpretation of the results of the survey of employers  \nMARKET STUDY: UNIVERSITY AND COLLEGE PROGRAMS IN HEALTH  17  \nFINAL REPORT – MARCH 2016 \nThe recommendations presented in the conclusion aim to help Campus Saint-Jean develop and implement \nprograms, as applicable. \n1.2 METHODOLOGY  \nThere are three distinct elements to the methodology used in carrying out this study, namely demographic \nresearch regarding Francophones in Alberta, consultation with the province’s Francophone communities, \nand a market study for eight distinct college and university programs. \nFirst, Axion consulted Francophone associations and organizations to obtain recent demographic data \nregarding Francophones in Alberta. The information needed was related, among other things, to: \n The characteristics of the Francophone population of Alberta according to the 2011 National \nHousehold Survey; \n A portrait of Francophone immigration in Alberta; \n The health problems of certain communities with a larger concentration of Francophones. \nThis information was analyzed in order to present a demographic profile of the Francophone population of \nthe province. \nThe second part of this study aimed to consult Francophone communities in the province in order to \nidentify their workforce needs in the health sector. A series of consultations were organized in eight \ncommunities in the south, centre, northeast and northwest of the province. The meetings aimed at \nobtaining more information regarding the health services that should be available as a priority in order to \nbetter serve the province's Francophone communities. \nWith the information obtained, Axion was able to target eight educational programs for which targeted \nmarket studies were conducted. \nEach of the market studies was conducted using the same methodology.  \nAxion conducted a survey of online research from: \n Several major stakeholders in the targeted sectors, such as Alberta Health and national and \nprovincial professional associations; \n Colleges in Alberta and Canada; \n Various levels of government. \nThe studies included four sections: \n A presentation of sectoral data; \n A presentation and analysis of data from interviews with key people; \n Conditions for access to the profession; \n The conclusion and recommendations. \nThe presentation of sectoral data, using documentation, is divided into four subsections. We consider the \nprofessional profiles, we examine the general characteristics of the field, we analyze labour market trends \nand current and future areas of application, and we study qualitative and quantitative data regarding the \nworkforce in Ontario. \nThe second component includes an analysis of the results of a survey of 24 individuals, employers and \nrepresentatives from professional associations in the eight chosen disciplines. The individuals in question \nMARKET STUDY: UNIVERSITY AND COLLEGE PROGRAMS IN HEALTH  18 \n FINAL REPORT – MARCH 2016 \nwere selected jointly by Axion and Campus Saint-Jean. This qualitative and non-scientific survey focused \non the potential for development in the field. Axion contacted about fifty people throughout Alberta by \ntelephone and by email. The questionnaire is in Appendix 1 and the list of people who responded to the \nsurvey is in Appendix 2. \nIn addition to the individuals previously identified, Axion tried several times to contact officials from the \nHuman Resource departments of various health institutions (hospitals, long-term care centres, etc.). \nThe third component deals with conditions for accessing the profession in Alberta and educational \nprograms offered at colleges and universities in Alberta and elsewhere in Canada.  \nEach market study ends with recommendations to Campus Saint-Jean regarding the creation of an \neducational program.  \n2. PRESENTATION OF THE DEMOGRAPHIC PROFILE  \n2.1 FRANCOPHONE POPULATION IN ALBERTA  \nAccording to the 2011 National Household Survey, Francophones represent 2.1% of the total population of \nAlberta, or 74,075 residents whose first official language spoken is French. 1 In Alberta, the portrait of the \nFrancophone community varies largely depending on the criterion used, namely that of mother tongue \n(MT) or first official language spoken (FOLS), primarily regarding immigrants. In fact, French is not the \nmother tongue of a lot of immigrants, for whom French is their FOLS and who speak French as a second or \nthird language.  \nThe FOLS criterion is increasingly used in other provinces, such as Ontario, to present a portrait of the \nminority Francophone community. \nAlthough data from 2011 must be treated with caution, it is nonetheless interesting to note that, between \n2006 and 2011, the population of Alberta for whom French was the FOLS increased by 10.6%, from 67,000 \nto 74,074 people. In 10 years (2001-2011), the population of Alberta with French as their FOLS increased by \n19.5%, or 12,070 people. 2 The other provinces, with the exception of Ontario and British Columbia, saw a \ndecrease in the number of people with French as their FOLS during the same period. 3  \nThe sharp increase in the number of people with French as their FOLS in Alberta is explained in large part \nby the arrival of recent immigrants whose FOLS was French. In fact, three of four new residents of Alberta \n1 Brynaert Brennan and Associates. Immigration francophone en Alberta, Portrait statistique.

Moreover, the percentage of Francophones 0 to 14 years old is much lower than the \nprovincial percentage for the same age group (11% compared to 19%). \nTable 1.

In \nfact, 27.8% of Francophones were 55 or older in 2011, compared to 21% of the population as a whole.  \nA second element that must be considered is that, according to the 2006 census by Statistics Canada, 80% \nof Francophone seniors aged 65 and over were in four census divisions. There were 42% in the Edmonton \nmetropolitan area, 22% in the greater Calgary area, 8% in the northeast, including Bonnyville and Saint-\nPaul, where one in four seniors was Francophone in 2006, and 8% in the northwest, in the villages of Falher \nand Girouxville, where four of five seniors were Francophones.8  \nThis situation could have an impact on the demand for health services over the short, medium and long \nterms. In effect, several Canadian and international studies show a sharp decline in the second language \nlearned (in this case English) among seniors after their retirement. Moreover, studies clearly show that, in \nstressful situations, seniors tend to turn to their mother tongue. Finally, seniors with a cognitive disability \nsuch as dementia gradually lose their ability to communicate in the second language learned.9  \nAnother characteristic of the Francophone population in Alberta is the sharp rise in the number of \nFrancophone immigrants who arrived in the province between 2001 and 2011. In fact, according to the \nNational Household Survey, 22% of Francophones (FOLS) in Alberta are immigrants, or 16,230 people. \nOne quarter of them (4,215) arrived between 2001 and 2006 and just under one third (5,040) chose to live \nin Alberta between 2006 and 2011. It must be noted that 41% of very recent immigrants indicated only \nFrench as their FOLS.10  \nIn general, immigrants who arrive in Canada are in relatively good health due to selection processes and \ndisease screening policies. However, several studies, including the one published by the Canadian Medical \nAssociation Journal in 2011, note that the health of immigrants tends to deteriorate. That deterioration \nmay be the result of several factors: lifestyle (stress, sedentariness), diet (difficulty finding food in the \ncountry of origin), culture and language (language barrier), or poor knowledge of the health care system \n(lack of a family doctor, or poor knowledge of methods for preventing illness, such as preventive tests, \nvaccines and screening).11  \n2.3 HEALTH PROFILE OF COMMUNITIES WITH A GREATER CONCENTRATION OF FRANCOPHONES  \nOver the last few years, the Government of Alberta has developed a series of community profiles that \nprovide demographic and socioeconomic data, as well as data on the health of communities in the \nprovince. The province was subdivided into five large health services zones (North, Central, South, Calgary \nand Edmonton). Those zones were then subdivided into smaller areas, referred to as Local Geographic \nAreas (LGA). The purpose of the profiles is to make it easier to plan health services in the 132 LGAs \nestablished by Alberta Health Services. One of the socioeconomic indicators is related to the language \nspoken at home, but unfortunately, it only refers to non-official languages. However, some of that data \ncan be used to provide a portrait of communities with the greatest concentration of Francophones. \n8 Freychet, Yannick. Portrait des 50 + franco-albertains.

The difficult economic situation that currently prevails in \nNorthern Alberta could have an impact on the health of the population, in addition to causing an exodus of \nresidents.  \n2.3.1 NORTH ZONE  \nThe obesity rate in the North is much higher than the provincial average, according to data from 2013 \n(27.4% for the North vs. 19.3% for Alberta as a whole). Moreover, the proportion of sedentary people is \nslightly higher than the province as a whole (43.8% for the North vs. 42.6% for Alberta).12  \nNorthwest region \nIn the Northwest, the local geographic areas with a concentration of Francophones are Grand Prairie (3%), \nPeace River (5.7%) and Falher (46.5%). Alberta Health Services grouped Girouxville, with 52.6% \nFrancophones, and McLennan, with 14.2% Francophones, in the geographic region of Falher and \nSt-Isidore, along with the area of Peace River. \nIn the Falher region, which includes Girouxville and McLennan, the population decreased by 10% between \n1994 and 2014 and is older than the provincial population. In fact, 16.7% of the population in the Falher \nregion are over the age of 65, while that figure is 11.3% for the province.  \nMoreover, proportionally more families live below the after-tax low income cut-off (14.1% for the region \nvs. 10.7% for Alberta). Some facts worth mentioning regarding the health of the population in that \nregion:13  \n The birth rate among young girls is nearly double that of the province (35.8 vs. 17.4 births per 1,000 \nwomen). \n The death rate per 100,000 residents is higher in the region (596.2 vs. 452.2 for Alberta). \nCardiovascular diseases were the main cause of death reported between 2004 and 2013. \nThe geographic area of Peace River (which includes St-Isidore) saw a population growth of 13.2% between \n1994 and 2014, compared to an increase of 56% for the province as a whole. The proportion of youth under \nthe age of 17 (25.6%) in the area of Peace River is slightly higher than that of the province (22.2%). The \nregion has a greater proportion of Aboriginal residents (10.2% vs. 3.4% for Alberta). Some other \ninteresting facts worth mentioning:14  \n The birth rate is higher among women than for Alberta as a whole (31.2 vs. 26.8 births per 1,000 \nwomen). That rate is more than double the provincial rate among young girls (39.3 vs. 17.4 per \n1,000 young girls). \n The spread rate of sexually transmitted infections is higher in the region than in the province as a \nwhole for four of the five most common diseases. \n The mortality rate per 100,000 residents is higher in the region (564.1 vs. 452.2 for Alberta). \nCardiovascular diseases were the main cause of death reported between 2004 and 2013.  \n The number of visits to the emergency room for mental and behavioural disorders is higher in the \nregion than in the province as a whole (899.4 vs. 633.3 per 100,000 residents). \n12 Alberta Health, Community Profile.

The proportion of youth under the age of 17 \n(24.6%) is slightly higher than the provincial rate (22.2%), while the proportion of seniors is lower than that \nof the province (6.1% vs. 11.3%). Other interesting facts to note:15  \n The birth rate is higher among women than for Alberta as a whole (35.6 vs. 26.8 births per 1,000 \nwomen) and among young girls (27.1 vs. 17.4 per 1,000 young girls). \n The spread rate of sexually transmitted infections is higher in the region than in the province as a \nwhole for four of the five most common diseases. \n The mortality rate per 100,000 residents is higher in the region (513.4 vs. 452.2 for Alberta). \nCardiovascular diseases were the main cause of death reported between 2004 and 2013.  \nThe geographic area of Jasper is also included in the greater northern region according to Alberta Health \nServices. The proportion of youth under the age of 17 is much lower compared to the province (14.4% vs. \n22.2%). There are also fewer seniors in that region than in the province as a whole (6.8% vs. 11.3%). The \nfollowing statistics are also relevant:16  \n The spread rate of sexually transmitted infections is higher in the region than in the province as a \nwhole for three of the four main diseases for which a comparison was possible. \n The inpatient discharge rate for mental and behavioural disorders per 100,000 residents is nearly \ndouble the provincial rate (237.8 vs. 120.0). \nNortheast region \nIn the Northeast region, the main local geographic areas with a high concentration of Francophones are \nBonnyville (7.4%), St-Paul (14.6%), Cold Lake (7.3%), Wood Buffalo including Fort McMurray (3.1%), and \nLac La Biche including Plamondon (8%).  \nThe breakdown of the population is about the same in Bonnyville as elsewhere in the province, with the \nexception of the proportion of Aboriginal and Inuit residents, which is higher in this region than elsewhere \nin Alberta (10% vs. 3.4%). There is also a large proportion of families living below the after-tax low income \ncut-off (13.1% for the region vs. 10.7% for Alberta). Other points of interest for this region are as follows:17  \n The birth rate is higher among women than for Alberta as a whole (32.3 vs. 26.8 per 1,000 women). \nThat rate is more than double the provincial rate for young girls (42.9 vs. 17.4 per 1,000 young \ngirls). \n The spread rate of sexually transmitted infections is higher in the region than in the province as a \nwhole for three of the four main diseases for which a comparison was possible. \n The mortality rate per 100,000 residents is higher in the region (560 vs. 452.2 for Alberta). \nCardiovascular diseases were the main cause of death reported between 2004 and 2013. \n The number of visits to the emergency room for mental and behavioural disorders is higher in the \nregion than in the province as a whole (1,090.5 vs. 633.3 per 100,000 residents). \n The inpatient discharge rate for mental and behavioural disorders per 100,000 residents is more \nthan double the provincial rate (298.5 vs. 120.0).  \n15 Alberta Health.

The proportion of Aboriginal and Inuit residents is \nmuch higher in this region than elsewhere in Alberta (32.2% vs. 3.4%). Like the Bonnyville region, St-Paul \nhas a larger proportion of families living below the after-tax low income cut-off (13.0% for the region vs. \n10.7% for Alberta). The region also has other characteristics that differ from the provincial reality:18  \n The birth rate is higher among women than for Alberta as a whole (34.0 vs. 26.8 per 1,000 women). \nThat rate is almost four times higher than for the province as a whole among young girls (66.6 vs. \n17.4 per 1,000 young girls). \n The spread rate of sexually transmitted infections is higher in the region than in the province as a \nwhole for four of the five most common diseases. \n The mortality rate per 100,000 residents is higher in the region (617.4 vs. 452.2 for Alberta). \nCardiovascular diseases were the main cause of death reported between 2004 and 2013. \n The number of visits to the emergency room for mental and behavioural disorders is three times \nhigher in the region than in the province as a whole (1,930.8 vs. 633.3 per 100,000 residents). \n The inpatient discharge rate for mental and behavioural disorders per 100,000 residents is nearly \nfour times higher than the provincial rate (472.5 vs. 120.0).  \nThe population of the Cold Lake region is quite young. The proportion of youth aged 17 and under is \ngreater than that of the province as a whole (28.9% vs. 22.2% in Alberta), and the proportion of people \naged 65 and over is lower than the provincial percentage (6.7% vs. 11.3%). The region has other interesting \ncharacteristics:19  \n The birth rate is higher among women than for Alberta as a whole (37.3 vs. 26.8 per 1,000 women). \nThat rate is more than double the provincial rate among young girls (42.0 vs. 17.4 per 1,000 young \ngirls). \n The spread rate of sexually transmitted infections is higher in the region than in the province as a \nwhole for four of the five most common diseases. \n The mortality rate per 100,000 residents is higher in the region (502.4 vs. 452.2 for Alberta). \nTumours were the main cause of death reported between 2004 and 2013. \nThe population in the Wood Buffalo region grew by 132.4% between 1994 and 2014, compared to 56% for \nthe province of Alberta as a whole. The proportion of youth aged 17 and under is slightly higher than the \nprovincial percentage (26.4% vs. 22.2% for Alberta), while the percentage of people aged 65 and over is \n5.9% compared to 11.3% in the province. The Wood Buffalo region has a large number of Aboriginal and \nInuit residents (38.4% of the population vs. 3.4% in Alberta). We note a larger proportion of single-parent \nfamilies in this region (16.0% vs. 11.1% for Alberta). Other characteristics of this region are as follows:20  \n The birth rate is higher among women than for Alberta as a whole (36.1 vs. 26.8 per 1,000 women). \nThat rate is more than three times higher than for the province as a whole among young girls (54.8 \nvs. 17.4 per 1,000 young girls). \n The spread rate of sexually transmitted infections is higher in the region than in the province as a \nwhole for four of the five most common diseases. \n18 Alberta Health.

The proportion of youth under the \nage of 17 is slightly higher in the region compared to the province as a whole (25.9% vs. 22.2%). There is \nalso a large number of Aboriginal and Inuit residents (13.3% vs. 2.4% for Alberta). Like Bonnyville and St-\nPaul, this region has a larger proportion of families living below the after-tax low income cut-off (14.4% vs. \n10.7% for Alberta). Other characteristics worth noting:21  \n The birth rate is higher among women than for Alberta as a whole (30.8 vs. 26.8 per 1,000 women). \nThat rate is nearly triple the provincial rate among young girls (48.2 vs. 17.4 per 1,000 young girls). \n The spread rate of sexually transmitted infections is higher in the region than in the province as a \nwhole for four of the five most common diseases. \n The mortality rate per 100,000 residents is higher in the region (572.5 vs. 452.2 for Alberta). \nCardiovascular diseases were the main cause of death reported between 2004 and 2013.  \n The number of visits to the emergency room for mental and behavioural disorders is higher in the \nregion than in the province as a whole (863.5 vs. 633.3 per 100,000 residents). \n The inpatient discharge rate for mental and behavioural disorders per 100,000 residents is nearly \nthree times higher than the provincial rate (332.6 vs. 120.0).  \n2.3.2 CENTRAL ZONE  \nIn the Central Zone, the only community with a notable concentration of Francophones is the local \ngeographic area of Wainwright (3.3%). In the Central Zone, the obesity rate is slightly higher than the \nprovincial rate (21.2% vs. 19.3% for Alberta), as is the percentage of sedentary people (45.5% vs. 42.6% for \nAlberta). \nIn the Wainwright region, the proportion of youth aged 17 and under is slightly higher than the provincial \nproportion (25% vs. 22.2%). The region also includes fewer Aboriginal and Inuit residents than the province \nas a whole (0.7% vs. 3.4%). The only other characteristic that is important to note is the following:22  \n The mortality rate per 100,000 residents is higher in the region (534.8 vs. 452.2 for Alberta). \nCardiovascular diseases were the main cause of death reported between 2004 and 2013.  \n2.3.3 CALGARY ZONE  \nAccording to Alberta Health, the communities of Banff and Canmore are included in the greater Calgary \nZone. In this zone, the obesity rate is lower than for the province as a whole (14.3% vs. 19.3% for Alberta). \n21 Alberta Health. Community Profile.

Banff and Canmore have 5.2% and 6.1% Francophones respectively. \nOne in two people in Banff is between 18 and 34 years old (49.4% vs. 40.4% for Alberta). The proportion of \nyouth aged 17 and under is only 10.6%, while it is 22.2% provincially. There are also fewer people aged 65 \nand over in this region compared to the province (4.9% vs. 11.3%). The following other characteristics are \nto be noted:23  \n The spread rate of sexually transmitted infections is higher in the region than in the province as a \nwhole for three of the five most common diseases. \n The inpatient discharge rate for mental and behavioural disorders per 100,000 residents is higher \nthan the provincial rate (200.3 vs. 120.0).  \nThe population in the Canmore region grew by 91.8% between 1994 and 2014, compared to 56% for the \nprovince of Alberta as a whole. The region has a large proportion of Aboriginal and Inuit residents (16.4% \nvs. 3.4% provincially). The other notable characteristics of this region are as follows24  \n The birth rate among young girls is nearly double that of the province (37.5 vs. 17.4 births per 1,000 \nyoung women). \n The spread rate of sexually transmitted infections is higher in the region than in the province as a \nwhole for three of the five most common diseases. \n The number of visits to the emergency room for mental and behavioural disorders in the region is \nmore than double that of the province as a whole (1,290.4 vs. 633.3 per 100,000 residents). \n2.3.4 EDMONTON ZONE  \nThe Edmonton Zone has a 2.5% Francophone population. The obesity rate is similar to the provincial \npercentage (19.8% vs. 19.3%). In the same vein, the proportion of sedentary people is very close to the \nprovincial percentage (42.8% vs. 42.6%).25 \n3. PRESENTATION AND ANALYSIS OF DATA FROM THE CONSULTATIONS \nIn order to identify the need for Francophone and bilingual labour to better serve Francophone \ncommunities in Alberta in terms of health care, consultations were organized in four regions (Calgary, \nEdmonton, Northeast and Northwest).  \nIn Calgary and Edmonton, Axion organized two sessions, one in the afternoon and the other in the \nevening, in order to reach seniors and the general population. In the Northeast and Northwest, we \norganized two videoconferences in the evening to reach several communities at the same time. The \nNorthwest region included participants in St-Isidore, Grande Prairie and Falher, while the consultation in \n23 Alberta Health. Community Profile.

The \nvideoconferences took place in schools. All of the consultations were held from January 19 to 21, 2016.  \nA discussion template with four main questions was prepared to gather the same information from the \nvarious communities:  \n Health services currently available in French; \n Health services that should be available as a priority in French; \n The relevance of creating a health care aide program; \n The order of priority for the programs previously identified. \n3.1 PROFILE OF PARTICIPANTS  \nA total of 68 people took part in the 8 consultations, for an average of 11 participants per region. The \nbreakdown by region is indicated in Table 5. \nMARKET STUDY: UNIVERSITY AND COLLEGE PROGRAMS IN HEALTH  29  \nFINAL REPORT – MARCH 2016 \nTable 5.

As with Calgary and Edmonton, they \ninvolved both seniors and retirees as well as professionals in the health care and education sectors. \n3.2 FRANCOPHONE NEEDS REGARDING HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONALS  \nCalgary area  \nAccording to participants in the Calgary area, many doctors and health care professionals speak French, \nbut it is difficult to find those professionals and access their services. Participants indicated that \napproximately 300 health care professionals in Calgary speak French. The two groups consulted, however, \nindicated that access health care professionals who are able to provide services in French is a major issue \nfor Calgary residents. \nThe groups noted that some services are available in French in Calgary: doctors, nurse practitioners, \noccupational therapists, dietitians, physiotherapists and dentists. However, it is important to note that \nthose services are only available because there are bilingual professionals working in those fields.  \nAgain according to participants, no health care services are officially available in French in Calgary, with the \nexception of the newly established Francophone clinic. Within health care institutions, access to \nFrancophone professionals is random, as their number is quite limited. Translation services are also \navailable for those who have difficulty or who request such services.  \nWhen establishing priorities regarding health care professionals, Francophones in Calgary targeted certain \nprofessions, indicated in the table below.  \nMARKET STUDY: UNIVERSITY AND COLLEGE PROGRAMS IN HEALTH  30 \n FINAL REPORT – MARCH 2016 \nMARKET STUDY: UNIVERSITY AND COLLEGE PROGRAMS IN HEALTH  31  \nFINAL REPORT – MARCH 2016 \nTable 6.

There was also the question of offering mixed diplomas in partnership with colleges or \nuniversities.  \nEdmonton area \nThe situation in the Edmonton area is substantially similar to that of Calgary. There are professionals who \nspeak French, but they are hard to find. Moreover, some do not dare publicize that they speak French for \nfear of increasing their workload. That said, participants indicated that a lot of progress has been made in \nthe last 20 years.  \nThe situation for new residents is very difficult, however, particularly those who do not understand English. \nThe problem of identifying Francophone professionals is the same in Edmonton and in Calgary. Over the \nlast few years, a health navigator service has been implemented to accompany new residents and offer \nthem interpretation services, as needed. \nWithin health care institutions, patients who are unable to communicate in English have difficulty \nexplaining their health condition, which could have repercussions on their safety. The situation is the same \nfor home care, which is governed by Alberta Health Services. Contracts are awarded to private companies \nthat do not see language as being important. \nAccording to participants, emphasis must be placed on primary care and front line personnel. The \nestablishment of priorities regarding health care professionals gave the results shown in the following \ntable. \nTable 7.

A team of psychologists, occupational therapists and speech language \ntherapists form Edmonton services Francophone clients, but follow-up is often provided by Anglophone \nprofessionals. The health office also offers health promotion and prevention services in French and a foot \ncare nurse is also bilingual. \nThe establishment of priorities regarding health care professionals gave the results shown in the following \ntable. \nTable 8.

Offering distance courses could be complemented by on-campus sessions during specific \nperiods. \nNorthwest region \nIn the Northwest, we see a large number of bilingual health care professionals: doctors, dentists, \nchiropractors, osteopaths, a few hospital nurses, some home care attendants, one hospital \nphysiotherapist, one pharmacist and ambulance attendants. Participants indicated that some bilingual \nservices used to be available, but that they disappeared after Francophone professionals left. In the school \nsystem, the team of occupational therapists and speech-language pathologists come from Edmonton for \nthe initial diagnosis, but follow-ups must be conducted with Anglophone personnel. \nThe establishment of priorities regarding health care professionals gave the results shown in the following \ntable. \nMARKET STUDY: UNIVERSITY AND COLLEGE PROGRAMS IN HEALTH  33  \nFINAL REPORT – MARCH 2016 \nTable 9.

The importance of \ndistance programs was once again mentioned in order to make education accessible to youth in the \nregions.  \n3.3 CHOICE OF COLLEGE AND UNIVERSITY PROGRAMS   \nTo retain the programs that garnered the most attention among participants in the consultations, we \nweighted the responses on a scale from five points for the first priorities and one point for the fifth \npriorities. Although not scientific, this approach gave a good overview, however, of the most important \ntraining programs according to participants. \nThe table below gives the results of the weighting process. \nTable 10.

PRESENTATION OF DATA FOR THE HEALTH CARE AIDE COLLEGE PROGRAM \n4.1 OCCUPATIONAL PROFILE OF THE TARGET SECTOR  \nAccording to Human Resources and Skills Development Canada, 27 health care aides are part of the “Health \nOccupations” skill type and the “Nurse aides, orderlies and patient services associates” unit group in the \nNational Occupational Classification (NOC 3413). That group is part of the larger “Assisting occupations in \nsupport of health services” group (NOC 341).  \nHealth care aides provide assistance to elderly, disabled, or chronically ill people who require short term \nassistance or ongoing support. 28  \nHealth care aides perform some or all of the following duties: 29  \n Answer calls, provide and empty bedpans, wash and clothe patients and do their toiletries.  \n Use food trays and feed patients or help them eat and choose their menu, and measure intake and \noutput as needed. \n Weigh, lift, turn or position patients and help them walk with a walker or crutches. \n Supervise series of exercises done by patients, distribute medication and reminders, care for \nsimple wounds, use respiratory equipment or provide urinary care. \n Implement therapeutic interventions for behaviour management. \n Administer suppositories and fleet enemas and assist with toileting. \n Ensure the safety of their clients and themselves. \n Communicate with clients, and observe and report on client condition.  \n4.2 GENERAL CHARACTERISTICS OF THE TARGET SECTOR  \n4.2.1 TYPE OF EMPLOYMENT  \nAccording to the data provided by Alberta Health, 90% of health care aides work in continuing care, while \n10% work in acute care. Health care aides can work at long-term care institutions or in the patient’s home. \nThe hours of work vary greatly, as some agencies offer 24-hour and weekend service. It therefore often \ninvolves shift work and weekend work. \nGiven the nature of the work (lifting, washing and dressing patients), aides may be required to lift heavy \nloads and remain standing for long periods. They must therefore be in good health and be familiar with \ntechniques for lifting patients without injuring them. \n27 Human Resources and Skills Development Canada, Nurse aides, orderlies and patient service associates unit group, \nhttp://www5.hrsdc.gc.ca/NOC/English/NOC/2011/Profile.aspx?val1=3413, site accessed in February 2016. \n28 Alberta Government, OCCInfo, Occupations and Educational Programs, http://occinfo.alis.alberta.ca/occinfopreview/info/browse-\noccupations/occupation-profile.html?id=71003293, site accessed in February 2016. \n29 Ibid. \nhttp://www5.hrsdc.gc.ca/NOC/English/NOC/2011/Profile.aspx?val1=3413\nhttp://occinfo.alis.alberta.ca/occinfopreview/info/browse-occupations/occupation-profile.html?id=71003293\nhttp://occinfo.alis.alberta.ca/occinfopreview/info/browse-occupations/occupation-profile.html?id=71003293\nMARKET STUDY: UNIVERSITY AND COLLEGE PROGRAMS IN HEALTH  36 \n FINAL REPORT – MARCH 2016 \n4.2.2 SALARY  \nAccording to the Alberta Learning Information Service site, the average salary in 2013 at the start of a \nhealth care aide’s career was $17.94 per hour and could be as high as $21.65 per hour. The average salary \nfor health care aides was $20 per hour or $31,005 per year. The average salary in the health and social \nservices industry was $30,843 per year in 2013. The average work week for health care aids was 30 hours. 30  \nChart 1. Average hourly salary31 \nThe salaries of health care aides can vary considerably depending on the employer and the employee’s \nresponsibilities and experience.  \n4.3 LABOUR MARKET TRENDS   \nAlberta \nIn Alberta, 31,083 people were working as nurse aides, orderlies and patient service associates as of \nDecember 31, 2014, making that category of profession the second largest in the number of employees in \nthe province’s health sector. 32   \nAccording to information obtained from job sites in Alberta from 2013 to 2017, job prospects for health \ncare aides are above average and this group is expected to see 3.1% growth per year until 2017. 33  It is \nforecasted that 248 health care aide positions will be created each year, in addition to job openings created \nby employment turnover, promotions or retirements. \n30 Ibid. \n31 Alberta Government, Industry Profiles, Health Care and Social Assistance Industry 2015, p. 6. \n32 Alberta Health, Health Human Resources Planning and Strategy Branch, Health Care Aides, 2016. \n33 Alberta Government, OCCinfo: Occupations and Educational Programs, http://occinfo.alis.alberta.ca/occinfopreview/info/browse-\noccupations/occupation-profile.html?id=71003293, site accessed in February 2016. \n0\n5\n10\n15\n20\n25\n30\n35\nHealth care aides Health and welfare sector All industries\nhttp://occinfo.alis.alberta.ca/occinfopreview/info/browse-occupations/occupation-profile.html?id=71003293\nhttp://occinfo.alis.alberta.ca/occinfopreview/info/browse-occupations/occupation-profile.html?id=71003293\nMARKET STUDY: UNIVERSITY AND COLLEGE PROGRAMS IN HEALTH  37  \nFINAL REPORT – MARCH 2016 \nWhen examining the forecasts, it is nonetheless important to consider the economic conditions that affect \nthe entire Alberta job market following the drop in the price of a barrel of oil. It is also important to note \nthat, in some cases, growth may be concentrated outside the large centres.  \nGiven the average age of 44 for nurse aides, orderlies and patient service associates (NOC 3413), \nretirements are expected to increase considerably over the next few years. 34  \nAccording to data from the Alberta Learning Information Service, obtained through the 2013 Alberta Wage \nand Salary Survey, 40% of employers seeking to hire health care aides had difficulty finding employees and \n12% still had positions available after 4 months. According to the data, the vacancy rate for health care \naides was at 4% in 2013.  \nAccording to the health and social services industry profile prepared by the Government of Alberta in 2015, \nthis sector is expected to continue growing at an average rate of 3% per year between 2015 and 2019. That \nrate will be greater than the average growth of the other sectors of the Alberta economy. 35  \nCanada \nDuring the period from 2013 to 2022, projections for the larger Assisting occupations in support of health \nservices group (NOC 341) that includes the Nurse aides, orderlies and patient services associates group \n(NOC 3413) show excess demand. It is expected that, across Canada, there will be 149,262 job \nopportunities resulting from expansion demand and replacement demand, while there will be 143,936 job \nseekers. \nChart 2. Projection of demand – Assisting occupations in support of health services (NOC 341). \nJob openings are projected to arise from both employment growth and retirements. The retirement rate in \nthis occupational group is expected to be similar to the national average. As with most occupational groups \nin the health sector, the aging population and the increasing need for long-term care is projected to \nincrease the demand for health services assistants. This is particularly true since these workers provide \nfront-line services to people who are hospitalized and those living in long-term care facilities. Nevertheless, \nthe number of jobs created is expected to remain lower than recorded over the previous decade (2003-\n34 Ibid. \n35 Alberta Government, Industry Profiles, Health Care and Social Assistance Industry 2015, p. 2. \n120,000\n125,000\n130,000\n135,000\n140,000\n145,000\n150,000\n2013-2022\nJob seekers\nJob opportunities\nMARKET STUDY: UNIVERSITY AND COLLEGE PROGRAMS IN HEALTH  38 \n FINAL REPORT – MARCH 2016 \n2012), mainly because of the commitment made by governments to reduce deficits, thereby requiring \nhealth care providers to develop labour-saving strategies. With regard to labour supply, there will be a \nsignificant increase in the number of school leavers in response to the high demand for workers in this \noccupation. 36  \n4.4 QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE LABOUR DATA   \nAccording to data from Alberta Health for 2014, 20% of workers in the Health care aide category work full-\ntime, while 44% work part-time and 36% are casual employees. This data is very different in Alberta \ncompared to the rest of Canada, as 71% of people in this profession were working full-time in Canada in \n2013.  \nAgain according to that data, in Alberta, women held 91% of nurse aide, orderly and patient service \nassociate positions in 2014, while that percentage was 86% for the same category across Canada.  The \nresults are shown in Graph 3. 37  \nGraph 3. Percentage of women in the profession in Alberta and in Canada \nThe profession is open to new immigrants who meet the access conditions. In 2011, 20.5% of nurse aides, \norderlies and patient service associates were immigrants, a percentage that is higher than for all \nprofessions (13.7%).38  \n4.4.1 ESSENTIAL QUALIFICATIONS FOR A HEALTH CARE AIDE   \nThe following qualifications and skills are needed to become a health care aide: 39  \n36 Job Bank, Nurse aides, orderlies and patient service associates (NOC 3413), http://www.jobbank.gc.ca/report-\neng.do?area=9193&lang=eng&noc=3413&province=35&action=final&ln=n&s=2#outlook, site accessed in February 2016. \n37 Ibid. \n38 Service Canada, Nurse aides, orderlies and patient service associates, \nhttp://www.servicecanada.gc.ca/eng/qc/job_futures/statistics/3413.shtml, site accessed in February 2016. \n0\n10\n20\n30\n40\n50\n60\n70\n80\n90\n100\nPercentage of\nwomen in Alberta\nPercentage of\nwomen in Canada\nNurse aides, orderlies\nand patient service\nassociates\nAll professions\nhttp://www.guichetemplois.gc.ca/rapport-fra.do?region=9193&lang=fra&cnp=3413&province=35&action=final&ln=n&s=2#outlook\nhttp://www.guichetemplois.gc.ca/rapport-fra.do?region=9193&lang=fra&cnp=3413&province=35&action=final&ln=n&s=2#outlook\nhttp://www.servicecanada.gc.ca/eng/qc/job_futures/statistics/3413.shtml\nMARKET STUDY: UNIVERSITY AND COLLEGE PROGRAMS IN HEALTH  39  \nFINAL REPORT – MARCH 2016 \n The ability to be understanding, patient and non-judgemental \n Good physical and mental health \n Maturity and dependability \n The ability to communicate effectively and get along with people \n Sense of responsibility and discretion  \n Good judgement \n Sensitivity to the physical, social, cultural and psychological effects of aging \n Respectfulness of the client’s right to privacy and to be treated with dignity  \n Flexibility and resourcefulness \n The ability to work independently and as a member of a team \n Strong organizational and time-management skills \nIn addition to these qualifications, the studies conducted in 2005, 2007 and 2009 by Lum et al revealed that \nit is essential for health care aides to have linguistic and cultural knowledge that reflects their clientele in \norder to be able to understand their clients and meet their needs. 40  \n4.5 PRESENTATION OF DATA FROM INTERVIEWS WITH KEY PEOPLE  \nAxion gathered qualitative data by consulting with key people working with health care aides. We spoke \nwith five people who were able to provide us with information regarding this sector people working for the \nfollowing types of employers: health centres, seniors residences, Francophone employment centres, union \nrepresentatives, and doctors. The interviews took place between February 9 and 29, 2016. The survey was \nnot scientific, due to the number of respondents. It was more qualitative and focused on the potential for \ndevelopment of a French-language or bilingual training program for health care aides.  \nDespite numerous efforts, we were unable to talk to Human Resources staff in the province’s hospitals to \nidentify their labour needs. \nAlthough some of the respondents manage Francophone or bilingual institutions, none employ health care \naides as such, as they are employees of Alberta Health Services or Covenant Health.  \n4.5.1 TRAINING OF HEALTH CARE AIDES  \nAt this time, no training programs for health care aides are offered in French in Alberta. It is therefore very \ndifficult to find Francophone personnel to serve clients of Francophone or bilingual establishments, such as \nthe Manoir Saint-Joachim or the Saint-Thomas Community Health Centre.  \nThe establishments mentioned by the respondents as offering a good training program for health care \naides were Bow Valley College and CDI College of Business, Technology and Health. \nAccording to the respondents, Francophone health care aides often come from other provinces, such as \nQuebec. Unfortunately, their English is often poor, which makes it hard for them to find work.  \n39 Alberta Government, OCCinfo: Occupations and Educational Programs, http://occinfo.alis.alberta.The \nabca/occinfopreview/info/browse-occupations/occupation-profile.html?id=71003293, site accessed in February 2016. \n40 Canadian Research Network for Care in the Community, Ontario Personal Support Workers in Home and Community Care: \nCRNCC/PSNO Survey Results, http://www.ryerson.ca/content/dam/crncc/knowledge/infocus/factsheets/InFocus-\nOntario%20PSWs%20in%20Home%20and%20Community%20Care.pdf, site accessed in February 2016. \nhttp://www.ryerson.ca/content/dam/crncc/knowledge/infocus/factsheets/InFocus-Ontario%20PSWs%20in%20Home%20and%20Community%20Care.pdf\nhttp://www.ryerson.ca/content/dam/crncc/knowledge/infocus/factsheets/InFocus-Ontario%20PSWs%20in%20Home%20and%20Community%20Care.pdf\nMARKET STUDY: UNIVERSITY AND COLLEGE PROGRAMS IN HEALTH  40 \n FINAL REPORT – MARCH 2016 \n 4.5.2 FUTURE DEMAND  \nAll respondents believe that there will be a moderate expansion of the job market for graduates from a \nhealth care aide program over the next five to seven years. Although health agencies that hire these \nprofessionals are not seeking bilingual personnel, the demand for health care aides will continue to \nincrease, as health professionals are ageing and retiring and the population is continuing to age.  \nBilingual health care aides are an asset for employers, even though the employers are not necessarily \naware of that. As well, it is very difficult to find Francophone or bilingual health care aides. According to \none doctor questioned, bilingual health care aides must be trained so they can be available to serve the \ngrowing Francophone community. \nAccording to one respondent, there is interest in a French-language or bilingual health care aide program \namong new Francophone residents looking for work.  \nRespondents indicated that the greatest demand for health care aides would be from Alberta Health \nServices, retirement homes, or community organizations. The seniors sector is certainly the one in which \nthere will be the most demand for these professionals. One respondent indicated that Covenant Health \noften posts openings for bilingual health care aides in order to fill positions in long-term care institutions.  \n 4.5.3 PREFERRED TYPE OF TRAINING  \nAxion wanted to know the type of training that respondents would prefer for a health care aides program. \nRespondents did not seem to prefer one option over another. Some mentioned that a full-time program \nwould better meet the needs of students and their needs, while one respondent indicated a preference for \npart time, while ensuring that the program is paired with English courses.  \nConcerning the type of training (distance or on campus) that would best meet the needs and students and \nemployers, respondents indicated that a combination of distance training and on-campus training would \nmake the program more interesting for Francophones across the province.  \nThe respondents believe that it is important for such a program to offer cooperative internship \nopportunities that would thus allow students to obtain experience with local employers.  \nMARKET STUDY: UNIVERSITY AND COLLEGE PROGRAMS IN HEALTH  41  \nFINAL REPORT – MARCH 2016 \n 4.5.4 ADDITIONAL COMMENTS FROM RESPONDENTS  \nA few respondents made comments and suggestions for a potential program to best meet the needs of \nstudents and of the job market. The following points summarize those observations: \n It is essential to be able to count on Francophone or bilingual health care aides. \n Priority emphasis must be placed on health care close to patients. \n The importance of knowledge of English cannot be neglected. \n Internship experience in Alberta is very important for new residents. \n Marketing is needed in French-language high schools to promote careers in health care in French. \n There is little government desire to offer French-language services. \n4.6 CONDITIONS FOR ACCESS TO THE PROFESSION  \n 4.6.1 REGULATOR BODY  \nThe profession of health care aide is not regulated by a professional order in Alberta, and there is little data \nfor planning human resource needs. Alberta Health has nonetheless developed a competency profile for \nhealth care aides in order to standardize the teaching of this program in the various educational \ninstitutions.  \nAlberta Health is also working to develop a Health Care Aide Directory. That directory will provide \ninformation on the profession and on attaining the core competencies needed to train a qualified and \ncompetent workforce. The site was unveiled in Fall 2015 and should be functional by Spring 2016. 41  \nThis profession is also not regulated elsewhere in Canada and no certificate is issued by a professional \norder, unlike many other health care professions. Educational institutions issue a certificate to attest the \nstudent’s success, but there is no final program examination.  \n4.6.2 TRAINING AND COMPETITION  \nIn Alberta, the training needed to become a health care aide varies greatly from one employer to another. \nSeveral private and public institutions offer a postsecondary program for health care aides. Some \nemployers offer an on-the-job training program in partnership with postsecondary institutions, thus \nallowing employees to obtain their diploma while working. \nSome employers also require that their staff complete a first aid program and food security training. \nIn 2001, Alberta Health established a competency profile for health care aides. An updated competency \nprofile should be released in 2016. Alberta Health is also responsible for the health care aide provincial \ncurriculum. That curriculum was developed in 2005 and revised in 2010.  \nAt this time, the program is offered by a large number of private institutions, community colleges and \nemployers certified by the province. Some programs are offered full-time or part-time, while others are \noffered as distance education or offered partly in the regions. The full-time programs are offered over a \nperiod of 15 to 27 weeks. \n41 Alberta Health Care Aide Directory, About the Alberta Health Care Aide Directory, http://albertahcadirectory.com/, site access in \nFebruary 2016.  \nhttp://albertahcadirectory.com/\nMARKET STUDY: UNIVERSITY AND COLLEGE PROGRAMS IN HEALTH  42 \n FINAL REPORT – MARCH 2016 \nThe following table presents the programs offered in English in Alberta in this field, as well as those offered \nin French in Western Canada.  \nTable 12.

According to \nÉducacentre College’s website, its program is not recognized by the Government of Alberta, unlike the \nvast majority of programs offered by private and public institutions in Alberta.  \nIn Alberta, no institutions offer the health care aides program in French.  \n4.7 CONCLUSION AND RECOMMENDATIONS  \nIn Alberta, 31,083 people were working as nurse aides, orderlies and patient service associates as of \nDecember 31, 2014, making that category of profession the second largest in the number of employees in \nthe province’s health sector.  \nGiven the average age of 44 for nurse aides, orderlies and patient service associates (NOC 3413), \nretirements are expected to increase considerably over the next few years. \nAccording to data from the Alberta Learning Information Service, obtained through the 2013 Alberta Wage \nand Salary Survey, 40% of employers seeking to hire health care aides had difficulty finding employees and \n12% still had positions available after 4 months. According to the data, the vacancy rate for health care \naides was at 4% in 2013.  \nAs mentioned previously, the Francophone population of Alberta is older than the province’s population. In \nfact, 27.8% of Francophones were 55 or older in 2011, compared to 21% of the population as a whole.  \nAll respondents believe that there will be a moderate expansion of the job market for graduates from a \nFrancophone or bilingual personal care attendant program over the next five to seven years. Although \nhealth agencies that hire these professionals are not seeking bilingual personnel, the demand for personal \ncare attendants will continue to increase, as health professionals are ageing and retiring and the \nFrancophone population is continuing to age. As well, it is very difficult to find Francophone or bilingual \nhealth care aides.  \nAccording to one respondent, there is interest in a French-language or bilingual health care aide program \namong new Francophone residents looking for work.   \nLike everywhere else in Canada, the profession of health care aide is not regulated in Alberta. Educational \ninstitutions issue a certificate to attest to the student’s success, but there is no final program examination. \nIn 2001, Alberta Health established a competency profile for health care aides. An updated competency \nprofile should be released in 2016. Alberta Health is also responsible for the health care aide provincial \ncurriculum. That curriculum was developed in 2005 and revised in 2010. \nSeveral private and public institutions offer a postsecondary program for health care aides. Some \nemployers offer an on-the-job training program in partnership with postsecondary institutions, thus \nallowing employees to obtain their diploma while working.  \nAt this time, the program is offered by a large number of private institutions, community colleges and \nemployers certified by the province. Some programs are offered full-time or part-time, while others are \noffered as distance education or offered partly in the regions. No institutions offer the health care aide \nprogram in French.  \nMARKET STUDY: UNIVERSITY AND COLLEGE PROGRAMS IN HEALTH  46 \n FINAL REPORT – MARCH 2016 \nIn the other western provinces, two programs are offered in French: a health care aide certificate at \nUniversité de Saint-Boniface and the distance and classroom resident care attendant program at \nÉducacentre College. According to Éducacentre College’s website, its program is not recognized by the \nGovernment of Alberta, unlike the vast majority of programs offered by private and public institutions in \nAlberta.  \nGiven the promising number of positions for personal care attendants that will be created in the province \nover the next few years, the high percentage of elderly Francophones in Alberta (primarily in Edmonton \nand the northeast and northwest of the province), the difficulty finding bilingual health care aides at this \ntime, the interest of new Francophone immigrants in taking such training, and the lack of French-language \ntraining programs approved by the Province of Alberta that are offered in the province or elsewhere in the \nWest, Axion recommends that Campus Saint-Jean create a health care aide program to be offered in \nFrench. \nThe Francophones and employers consulted indicated their interest in the offer of a hybrid program \n(distance and on-campus) in order to allow Francophones from across Alberta to take the training. It would \nalso be very important to include English courses in the program to ensure that graduates are able to work \nin an environment where the language of work is still majority English. \n5. PRESENTATION OF DATA FOR THE LICENSED PRACTICAL NURSE  COLLEGE PROGRAM \n5.1 OCCUPATIONAL PROFILE OF THE TARGET SECTOR  \nAccording to Human Resources and Skills Development Canada,  42 licensed practical nurses are part of the \n“Health occupations competency group and the “Licensed Practical Nurses” unit group in the National \nOccupational Classification (NOC 3233). That group is part of the larger “Other technical occupations in \nhealth care” group (NOC 323).  \nLicensed practical nurses provide nursing care for patients, usually under the supervision of doctors, \nregistered nurses or other members of the health team. They can have a variety of responsibilities, \ndepending on the nature of their work, client needs, or the environment in which they work. In some \nworkplaces, licensed practical nurses can have a leadership role, assigning responsibilities to health care \naides, organizing patient care, and managing family concerns. 43  \nLicensed practical nurses work in hospitals, nursing homes, long-term care facilities, rehabilitation centres, \ndoctors’ offices, clinics, businesses, community health centres, schools and mental health institutions.  \n42 Human Resources and Skills Development Canada, Licensed Practical Nurses Unit Group, \nhttp://www30.rhdcc.gc.ca/CNP/English/NOC/2006/Profile.aspx?val=0&val1=3233, site accessed in February 2016. \n43 Alberta Government, OCCinfo: Occupations and Educational Programs, http://occinfo.alis.alberta.ca/occinfopreview/info/browse-\noccupations/occupation-profile.html?id=71002588, site accessed in February 2016. \nhttp://www30.rhdcc.gc.ca/CNP/English/NOC/2006/Profile.aspx?val=0&val1=3233\nhttp://occinfo.alis.alberta.ca/occinfopreview/info/browse-occupations/occupation-profile.html?id=71002588\nhttp://occinfo.alis.alberta.ca/occinfopreview/info/browse-occupations/occupation-profile.html?id=71002588\nMARKET STUDY: UNIVERSITY AND COLLEGE PROGRAMS IN HEALTH  47  \nFINAL REPORT – MARCH 2016 \nLicensed practical nurses carry out some or all of the following duties:  44  \n Provide nursing services within defined scope of practice, to patients based on patient assessment \nand care planning procedures; \n Perform nursing interventions such as taking vital signs, applying aseptic techniques including \nsterile dressing, ensuring infection control, monitoring nutritional intake and conducting specimen \ncollection; \n Administer medication and observe and document therapeutic effects; \n Provide pre-operative and post-operative personal and comfort care; \n Monitor established respiratory therapy and intravenous therapy; \n Monitor patients' progress, evaluate effectiveness of nursing interventions and consult with \nappropriate members of healthcare team; \n Provide safety and health education to the public; \n Take part in research activities. \n5.2 GENERAL CHARACTERISTICS OF THE TARGET SECTOR  \n5.2.1 TYPE OF EMPLOYMENT  \nAccording to data provided by Alberta Health, 42.6% of licensed practical nurses work in a hospital setting. \nNearly 27% work in nursing homes and another 26.6% work in a community setting. 45  \nChart 4. Workplace of licensed practical nurses \nEvening, night and weekend work is common. Positions are often part-time, temporary and on-call, \nparticularly early in a career. The duties of licensed practical nurses can be intellectually and emotionally \ndemanding. This type of work also requires good physical resistance.  \n5.2.2 SALARY  \n44 Human Resources and Skills Development Canada, Licensed Practical Nurses Unit Group, \nhttp://www30.rhdcc.gc.ca/CNP/English/NOC/2006/Profile.aspx?val=0&val1=3233, site accessed in February 2016. \n45 Alberta Health, Health Human Resources Planning and Strategy Branch, Licensed Practical Nurses, 2016. \n42.6 \n26.9 \n26.6 \n3.9 \nHospitals\nNursing homes\nCommunity health\nOther\nhttp://www30.rhdcc.gc.ca/CNP/English/NOC/2006/Profile.aspx?val=0&val1=3233\nMARKET STUDY: UNIVERSITY AND COLLEGE PROGRAMS IN HEALTH  48 \n FINAL REPORT – MARCH 2016 \nAccording to the Alberta Learning Information Service site, the average salary in 2013 at the start of a \nlicensed practical nurse’s career was $25.93 per hour and could be as high as $33.95 per hour. The average \nsalary for licensed practical nurses was $29.98 per hour or $43.142 per year. The average salary in the \nhealth and social services industry was $30,843 per year in 2013. The average work week for licensed \npractical nurses was 27.8 hours.46  \nChart 5. Average hourly salary47 \nThe salaries of licensed practical nurses can vary considerably depending on the employer and the \nemployee’s responsibilities and experience.  \n5.3 LABOUR MARKET TRENDS   \nAlberta \nIn Alberta, 13,915 people were working as licensed practical nurses as of December 31, 2015. That \nprofession grew by 51% between 2009 and 2014. At this time, 5.3% of licensed practical nurses working in \nthe province obtained their diploma abroad. 48  \nAccording to information obtained from job sites in Alberta from 2013 to 2017, job prospects for licensed \npractical nurses are above average and this group is expected to see 3.2% growth per year until 2017.49  It is \nforecasted that 224 licensed practical nurse positions will be created each year, in addition to job openings \ncreated by employment turnover, promotions or retirements.  \n46 Alberta Government, OCCinfo: Occupations and Educational Programs, http://occinfo.alis.alberta.ca/occinfopreview/info/browse-\noccupations/occupation-profile.html?id=71002588, site accessed in February 2016. \n47 Alberta Government, Industry Profiles, Health Care and Social Assistance Industry 2015, p. 6. \n48 Alberta Health, Health Human Resources Planning and Strategy Branch, Licensed Practical Nurses, 2016. \n49 Alberta Government, OCCinfo: Occupations and Educational Programs, http://occinfo.alis.alberta.ca/occinfopreview/info/browse-\noccupations/occupation-profile.html?id=71002588, site accessed in February 2016. \n29.98 \n29.51 \n28.12 \n27.00\n27.50\n28.00\n28.50\n29.00\n29.50\n30.00\n30.50\nLicensed practical nurses Health and welfare sector All industries\nhttp://occinfo.alis.alberta.ca/occinfopreview/info/browse-occupations/occupation-profile.html?id=71002588\nhttp://occinfo.alis.alberta.ca/occinfopreview/info/browse-occupations/occupation-profile.html?id=71002588\nhttp://occinfo.alis.alberta.ca/occinfopreview/info/browse-occupations/occupation-profile.html?id=71002588\nhttp://occinfo.alis.alberta.ca/occinfopreview/info/browse-occupations/occupation-profile.html?id=71002588\nMARKET STUDY: UNIVERSITY AND COLLEGE PROGRAMS IN HEALTH  49  \nFINAL REPORT – MARCH 2016 \nAccording to a study conducted in Quebec, the turnover rate is higher among licensed practical nurses \nthan among registered nurses. This is due to the lower average age for licensed practical nurses, fewer \npromotional opportunities and limited autonomy. 50  \nIn Alberta, retirements will have little short- or medium-term impact on the growth of this profession. The \naverage age of licensed practical nurses is 40.3, and 63.3% are under the age of 40.  \nChart 6. Demographic breakdown of licensed practical nurses in Alberta51 \nAccording to data from the Alberta Learning Information Service, obtained through the 2013 Alberta Wage \nand Salary Survey, 23% of employers seeking to hire licensed practical nurses had difficulty finding \nemployees and 6% still had positions available after 4 months. 52  \nAccording to the health and social services industry profile prepared by the Government of Alberta in 2015, \nthis sector is expected to continue growing at an average rate of 3% per year between 2015 and 2019. That \nrate will be greater than the average growth of the other sectors of the Alberta economy.53  \n50 Service Canada, Licensed Practical Nurses, http://www.servicecanada.gc.ca/eng/qc/job_futures/statistics/3233.shtml, site \nAccessed in February 2016. \n51 Alberta Health, Health Human Resources Planning and Strategy Branch, Licensed Practical Nurses, 2016. \n52 Alberta Government.

Projection of demand – Other technical occupations in health care (NOC 323) 54  \nThis occupational group consists is five professions. Only Opticians (NOC 3231) and Licensed practical \nnurses (NOC 3233) will see a labour shortage.  \nAs with most occupations in the health sector, aging population will increase the demand for technical \nhealth care workers. Employment growth is therefore expected to be above the average of all occupations. \nIn some provinces, more than half of the job openings are projected to result from retirements, even \nthough the retirement rate is expected to be similar to the average of all occupations. School leavers are \nprojected to account for the majority of job seekers. However, there will not be enough of these school \nleavers to meet the expected demand. Moreover, that shortage of workers is expected to be exacerbated \nby negative inter-occupational mobility. Indeed, the difficult working conditions (night and weekend shifts, \npart-time work) in the early stages of a career in these occupations discourage many workers.  \nFurthermore, these workers need to be licensed either by the provincial or territorial regulatory body to \nperform their work, which constrains labour supply for this occupational group. 55  \n5.4 QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE LABOUR DATA   \n54 Job Bank.

We \nspoke with six people who were able to provide us with information regarding this sector – people working \nfor the following types of employers: health centres, seniors residences, Francophone employment \ncentres, union representatives, school boards, and community health agencies. The interviews took place \nbetween February 9 and 29, 2016. The survey was not scientific, due to the number of respondents. It was \nmore qualitative and focused on the potential for development of a French-language or bilingual training \nprogram for licensed practical nurses.  \nDespite numerous efforts, we were unable to talk to human resources staff in the province’s hospitals to \nidentify their labour needs. \n5.5.1 TRAINING OF LICENSED PRACTICAL NURSES  \nAt this time, no training programs for licensed practical nurses are offered in French in Alberta. It is \ntherefore very difficult to find Francophone personnel to serve clients of Francophone or bilingual \nestablishments, such as the Manoir Saint-Joachim or the Saint-Thomas Community Health Centre. The \norganizations represented by the people interviewed had a few licensed practical nurses working for them, \nbut only one had a bilingual licensed practical nurse, who had received her training outside Canada. \n 5.5.2 FUTURE DEMAND  \nAlmost all respondents believe that there will be a moderate expansion of the job market for graduates \nfrom a Francophone or bilingual licensed practical nurse program over the next five to seven years. One \nrespondent believes that there will be strong expansion. Although health agencies that hire these \nprofessionals are not seeking bilingual personnel, the demand for licensed practical nurses in all languages \nwill continue to increase, as health professionals are ageing and retiring and the population is continuing to \nage.  \nBilingual licensed practical nurses are an asset for employers, even though the employers are not \nnecessarily aware of that. According to one doctor questioned, the number of bilingual health \nprofessionals must be increased, particularly those who do front line work, such as licensed practical \nnurses, who are closer to patients and families.  \nAccording to one respondent, there is interest in a French-language or bilingual licensed practical nurse \nprogram among new Francophone residents looking for work.  \nRespondents indicated that the greatest demand for licensed practical nurses would be from hospitals, \nlong-term care facilities, and primary care networks. To a lesser degree, community centres and home care \nservices could also recruit licensed practical nurses. \nMARKET STUDY: UNIVERSITY AND COLLEGE PROGRAMS IN HEALTH  53  \nFINAL REPORT – MARCH 2016 \nTwo respondents indicated their interest in hiring a total of 4.5 Francophone licensed practical nurses over \nthe next three years, while another respondent indicated that a seniors’ institution in the Northwest part of \nthe province has an urgent need for bilingual licensed practical nurses. \nMARKET STUDY: UNIVERSITY AND COLLEGE PROGRAMS IN HEALTH  54 \n FINAL REPORT – MARCH 2016 \n 5.5.3 PREFERRED TYPE OF TRAINING  \nAxion wanted to know the type of training that respondents would prefer for a licensed practical nurse \nprogram. Respondents did not seem to prefer one option over another. Some mentioned that a part-time \nprogram would allow students to continue working during their training. One respondent indicated a \npreference for part-time, while ensuring that the program was paired with English courses.  \nConcerning the type of training (distance or on campus) that would best meet the needs and students and \nemployers, almost all respondents indicated that a combination of distance training and on-campus \ntraining would make the program more interesting for Francophones across the province. This would also \nencourage graduates to remain in their community, and the program would thus create less constraints for \nemployers.  \nThe respondents believe that it is important for such a program to offer cooperative internship \nopportunities that would thus allow students to obtain experience with local employers. Students would \nalso better understand their work and would develop a good network of contacts, which could help them \nfind their first job. Two respondents stated that their organizations could take on intern licensed practical \nnurses.  \n 5.5.4 ADDITIONAL COMMENTS FROM RESPONDENTS  \nA few respondents made comments and suggestions for a potential program to best meet the needs of \nstudents and of the job market. The following points summarize those observations: \n There is a need for Francophone health care professionals  \n Priority emphasis must be placed on health care close to patients. \n Students must understand the expectations of the profession before embarking in it. \n The importance of knowledge of English cannot be neglected. \n Internship experience in Alberta is very important for new residents. \n Marketing is needed in French-language high schools to promote careers in health care in French. \n There is little government desire to offer French-language services. Bilingualism is not a criterion at \nthis time when hiring health care professionals. \n At this time, there is no need to increase internal capacity in French for licensed practical nurses, as \nthere is little demand from clients.  \n5.6 CONDITIONS FOR ACCESS TO THE PROFESSION  \n 5.6.1 REGULATOR BODY  \nIn Alberta, the profession of licensed practical nurse is regulated by the Health Professions Act and the \nLicensed Practical Nurses Profession Regulation.

In April 2015, the CLPNA published a new competency profile for its professionals. The new \nprofile reflects the new environments in which licensed practical nurses work due to demographic changes \nover the last few years and the emphasis that governments have placed on community health and \nleadership.60  \nAt this time, 10 colleges offer a licensed practical nurse program in English across the province.

That \nprofession grew by 51% between 2009 and 2014. At this time, 5.3% of licensed practical nurses working in \nthe province obtained their diploma abroad. \nAccording to data from the Alberta Learning Information Service, obtained through the 2013 Alberta Wage \nand Salary Survey, 23% of employers seeking to hire licensed practical nurses had difficulty finding \nemployees and 6% still had positions available after 4 months.  \nMARKET STUDY: UNIVERSITY AND COLLEGE PROGRAMS IN HEALTH  57  \nFINAL REPORT – MARCH 2016 \nAccording to the health and social services industry profile prepared by the Government of Alberta in 2015, \nthis sector is expected to continue growing at an average rate of 3% per year between 2015 and 2019. That \nrate will be greater than the average growth of the other sectors of the Alberta economy.   \nAs mentioned previously, the Francophone population of Alberta is older than the province’s population. In \nfact, 27.8% of Francophones were 55 or older in 2011, compared to 21% of the population as a whole.  \nAlmost all respondents believe that there will be a moderate expansion of the job market for graduates \nfrom a Francophone or bilingual licensed practical nurse program over the next five to seven years. \nRespondents indicated that the greatest demand for licensed practical nurses would be from hospitals, \nlong-term care facilities, and primary care networks. To a lesser degree, community centres and home care \nservices could also recruit licensed practical nurses. \nAccording to one respondent, there is interest in a French-language or bilingual licensed practical nurse \nprogram among new Francophone residents looking for work.  \nIn Alberta, the profession of licensed practical nurse is regulated by the Health Professions Act and the \nLicensed Practical Nurses Profession Regulation. To exercise the profession, a licensed practical nurse must: \n have successfully completed a training program approved by the Education Standards Advisory \nCommittee, a committee of the College of Licensed Practical Nurses of Alberta (CLPNA);  \n and have passed the Canadian Practical Nurse Registration examination administered by the \nCLPNA.  \nAt this time, 10 colleges offer a licensed practical nurse program in English across the province. Some \ninstitutions offer the program full-time on-campus, while others offer alternative teaching methods. No \ninstitutions offer the licensed practical nurse program in French.  \nOnly one program is offered in French in Western Canada, in Winnipeg. However, it seems that that \nprogram is not recognized by the College of Licensed Practical Nurses of Alberta.  \nGiven the promising forecasts regarding the number of positions for licensed practical nurses that will be \ncreated in the province over the next few years, the high percentage of elderly Francophones in Alberta \n(primarily in Edmonton and the Northeast and Northwest of the province), the difficulty finding bilingual \nlicensed practical nurses at this time, the interest of new Francophone immigrants in taking such training, \nand the lack of French-language training programs approved by the CLPNA that are offered in the province \nor elsewhere in the West, Axion recommends that Campus Saint-Jean create a licensed practical nurse \nprogram to be offered in French. \nThe Francophones and employers consulted indicated their interest in the offer of a hybrid program \n(distance and on-campus) in order to allow Francophones from across Alberta to take the training. It would \nalso be very important to include English courses in the program to ensure that graduates are able to work \nin an environment where the language of work is still majority English. \nMARKET STUDY: UNIVERSITY AND COLLEGE PROGRAMS IN HEALTH  58 \n FINAL REPORT – MARCH 2016 \n6. PRESENTATION OF DATA FOR THE MENTAL HEALTH WORKER  COLLEGE PROGRAM \n6.1 OCCUPATIONAL PROFILE OF THE TARGET SECTOR  \nAccording to Human Resources and Skills Development Canada,61 mental health workers are part of the \n“Occupations in education, law and social, community and government services” competency group and \nthe “Community and Social Service Workers” unit group in the National Occupational Classification (NOC \n4212). That group is part of the larger “Paraprofessional occupations in legal, social, community and \neducation services” group (NOC 421).  \nCommunity and social service workers administer and implement a variety of social assistance programs \nand community services, and assist clients to deal with personal and social problems. They are employed by \nsocial service and government agencies, mental health agencies, group homes, school boards, correctional \nfacilities and other establishments.62  \nMental health workers perform some or all of the following duties:63  \n Meet with clients to prepare a case history and obtain general information. \n Assess clients’ strengths and weaknesses in relation to competencies \n Help clients and their families examine the solutions available to them and to develop plans of \naction, while providing them with the assistance and accompaniment they need. \n Help clients find and use the resources available in the community. \n Meet with clients to assess their progress, encourage them and discuss various problems or \ndifficulties. \n Refer clients to other social services. \n Help clients manage medications. \n Maintain the confidentiality of records. \n Implement and organize the delivery of specific services in the community. \n Help assess the effectiveness of care programs by closely monitoring changes in behaviour in \nclients and their reactions to interventions. \n Maintain relations with other social service agencies and health care providers working with the \nsame clients in order to provide information and inquire about their progress. \n Keep up to date with new developments in the field of mental health. \n61 Human Resources and Skills Development Canada, Unit Group 4212 Community and Social Service Workers, \nhttp://www30.rhdcc.gc.ca/CNP/Francais/CNP/2006/Profil.aspx?val=0&val1=4212, site accessed in February 2016. \n62 Ibid. \n63 Ibid. and OCCinfo: Occupations and Educational Programs, http://occinfo.alis.alberta.ca/occinfopreview/info/browse-\noccupations/occupation-profile.html?id=71002146, site accessed in February 2016. \nhttp://www30.rhdcc.gc.ca/CNP/Francais/CNP/2006/Profil.aspx?val=0&val1=4212\nhttp://occinfo.alis.alberta.ca/occinfopreview/info/browse-occupations/occupation-profile.html?id=71002146\nhttp://occinfo.alis.alberta.ca/occinfopreview/info/browse-occupations/occupation-profile.html?id=71002146\nMARKET STUDY: UNIVERSITY AND COLLEGE PROGRAMS IN HEALTH  59  \nFINAL REPORT – MARCH 2016 \n6.2 GENERAL CHARACTERISTICS OF THE TARGET SECTOR  \n6.2.1 TYPE OF EMPLOYMENT  \nAccording to data provided by the Alberta Learning Information Service, 76% of workers in this category \n(NOC 4212) work in health and community services and in public administration. 64  They are seen in health \ncentres, hospitals, rehabilitation centres, group homes, community organizations that manage day \nprograms, mental health clinics, seniors’ facilities, long-term care facilities, private practices and \ncorrectional centres.  \nThese professionals normally work in offices and have regular hours, but they may be required to work \nevenings or weekends to organize or attend meetings or activities. \nAccording to the 2014 Labour Force Survey, 78% of community and social service workers work full-time, \ncompared to an average of 81% for all professions.65   \n6.2.2 SALARY  \nAccording to the Alberta Learning Information Service site, the average salary in 2013 at the start of a \nmental health worker’s career was $18.10 per hour and could be as high as $22.87 per hour. The average \nsalary for mental health workers was $20.09 per hour or $34,493 per year. The average salary in the health \nand social services industry was $30,843 per year in 2013. The average work week for mental health \nworkers was 32.7 hours.66  \nChart 9.

Job prospects are above average. This group is expected to see growth of 3.3% per year by 2017.68  \nIt is forecasted that 396 positions for social and community service workers will be created each year, in \naddition to the positions that will become available due to changes in positions, promotions or \nretirements.  \nAccording to data from the Alberta Learning Information Service, obtained through the 2013 Alberta Wage \nand Salary Survey, 29% of employers seeking to hire mental health workers had difficulty finding \nemployees and 6% still had positions available after 4 months.69 \nAccording to the health and social services industry profile prepared by the Government of Alberta in 2015, \nthis sector is expected to continue growing at an average rate of 3% per year between 2015 and 2019.

It is expected that, across \nCanada, there will be 168,406 job opportunities that will result from expansion demand and replacement \ndemand, while there will be 168,173 job seekers.  \n68 Alberta Government, OCCinfo: Occupations and Educational Programs, http://occinfo.alis.alberta.ca/occinfopreview/info/browse-\noccupations/occupation-profile.html?id=71002588, site accessed in February 2016. \n69 Ibid. \n70 Alberta Government, Industry Profiles, Health Care and Social Assistance Industry 2015, p. 2. \nhttp://occinfo.alis.alberta.ca/occinfopreview/info/browse-occupations/occupation-profile.html?id=71002588\nhttp://occinfo.alis.alberta.ca/occinfopreview/info/browse-occupations/occupation-profile.html?id=71002588\nMARKET STUDY: UNIVERSITY AND COLLEGE PROGRAMS IN HEALTH  61  \nFINAL REPORT – MARCH 2016 \nChart 10. Projection of demand – Paraprofessional occupations in legal, social, community and \neducation services (NOC 421)71  \nThis occupational group consists of seven professions. There will be a surplus of workers in certain fields, \nbut that of community and social service workers will be balanced.  \nJob openings are projected to arise from strong employment growth and from retirements. Expansion \ndemand is expected to be above the average, given the major needs in the social services sector. \nMoreover, although the number of retirements is expected to be high, the retirement rate is projected to \nbe similar to the average for all occupations. Workers in this occupational group are generally younger than \nthose in all occupations, but also usually retire at a younger age. With regard to labour supply, school \nleavers are expected to account for the majority of job seekers. Immigration also accounts for an \nappreciable number of job seekers. However, an appreciable number of workers are expected to seek \nopportunities in other occupations, which will create additional replacement needs.  \nThis occupation tends to receive many university graduates who were unable to find work related to their \nstudies after graduating.72  \n6.4 QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE LABOUR DATA   \nAccording to the 2014 Labour Force Survey, 78% of workers in this profession (NOC 4212) work full-time, \ncompared to an average of 81% for all professions. As well, according to the same survey, 20% of workers \nin the larger group (NOC 421) were self-employed workers, while the average for all professions was 14%.73 \nAccording to the same data, in Canada, women held 77% of positions in this profession, compared to an \naverage of 48% for all professions.

It is therefore \nvery difficult to find Francophone personnel to serve clients in Francophone or bilingual establishments. \nTwo respondents hired bilingual mental health workers in the last five years: one person full-time and five \npart-time. Most of those workers had studied in Quebec. One graduate had been trained in English at a \ncollege in Alberta. One respondent stated that it is sometimes hard to hire a bilingual person in this field, \nas training is not always recognized.  \n 6.5.2 FUTURE DEMAND  \nMost respondents believe that there will be a sharp or moderate expansion of the job market for graduates \nfrom a Francophone or bilingual mental health worker program over the next five to seven years. Two \nrespondents believe that there is a great need for this type of expertise, as society recognizes the more \nlong-term impact of inaction for the clientele affected. As the current economic situation in Alberta does \nnot help, respondents see even more need to have workers in place that can help families experiencing \ndifficulties. One respondent added that, in mental health, language is very important in understanding \nclients’ needs. \nRespondents indicated that the greatest demand for mental health workers would be from the educational \nsector, community health centres and Primary Care Networks.  \nThree of five respondents also indicated their interest in hiring a total of 5.5 mental health workers in the \nnext three years, while two respondents stated that they know of organizations (three hospitals, a \nFrancophone clinic and a military base) that need Francophone mental health workers in the Northeast of \nthe province and in the Calgary area.  \n 6.5.3 PREFERRED TYPE OF TRAINING  \nAxion wanted to know the type of training that respondents would prefer for a mental health worker \nprogram. Respondents did not seem to prefer one option over another. Some mentioned that a part-time \nprogram would allow students to continue working during their training. One respondent indicated a \npreference for part-time, while ensuring that the program is paired with English classes so that graduates \ncan work in both languages.  \nConcerning the type of training (distance or on campus) that would best meet the needs and students and \nemployers, almost all respondents indicated that a combination of distance training and on-campus \ntraining would make the program more interesting for Francophones across the province. That type of \ntraining would be more financially accessible for many potential students. This would also encourage \ngraduates to remain in their community, and the program would also create fewer constraints for \nemployers.  \nThe respondents believe that it is important for such a program to offer cooperative internship \nopportunities that would thus allow students to obtain experience with local employers. Students would \nalso better understand their work and would develop a good network of contacts, which could help them \nfind their first job. Two respondents stated that their organization could take on mental health interns, \nmainly in the winter and spring.  \nMARKET STUDY: UNIVERSITY AND COLLEGE PROGRAMS IN HEALTH  64 \n FINAL REPORT – MARCH 2016 \n 6.5.4 ADDITIONAL COMMENTS FROM RESPONDENTS  \nA few respondents made comments and suggestions for a potential program to best meet the needs of \nstudents and of the job market. The following points summarize those observations: \n There is a need for Francophone health care professionals.  \n Students must understand the expectations of the profession before embarking in it. \n Students must be ready to travel as part of their work. \n It is important for students to be fully bilingual. \n It is important for the curriculum to correspond to needs and regulations. \n Marketing is needed in French-language high schools to promote careers in health care in French. \n There is little government desire to offer French-language services. Bilingualism is not a criterion at \nthis time when hiring health care professionals. \n At this time, there is no need to increase internal capacity in French for mental health workers, as \nthere is very little demand from clients.  \n6.6 CONDITIONS FOR ACCESS TO THE PROFESSION  \n 6.6.1 REGULATOR BODY  \nThe profession of mental health worker is not regulated in Alberta.76   \nThe qualifications for mental health workers can vary considerably. Some are nurses, some are \npsychologists, and some are social workers.   \nThis profession is not regulated elsewhere in Canada. No certificate is issued by a professional order, unlike \nseveral other health professions. Educational institutions issue a certificate to attest the student’s success, \nbut there is no final program examination.  \nElsewhere in Canada, college or university studies specializing in social work, child and youth care, \ncounselling or another area of social sciences or health are usually required. \n 6.6.2 TRAINING AND COMPETITION  \nNo college in Alberta offers a mental health worker program as such. Several institutions offer a \nCommunity Service Worker or Community Support Worker program, which seems similar at first glance to \nthe mental health worker program found in other provinces. The program is defined as follows: \nThis diploma program will help you to acquire the knowledge and develop the skills \nnecessary to provide physical, psychological, and social support to individuals across \ntheir lifespan. Upon graduation, you will be able to provide safe and competent support \nfor those in need. You will be able to pursue meaningful work in a public or private \nsetting.

Job prospects are above average. This group is expected to see growth of 3.3% per year by 2017. It \nis expected that 396 positions for social and community service workers will be created each year, in \naddition to the positions that will become available due to changes in positions, promotions or \nretirements.  \nAccording to data from the Alberta Learning Information Service, obtained through the 2013 Alberta Wage \nand Salary Survey, 29% of employers seeking to hire mental health workers had difficulty finding \nemployees and 6% still had positions available after 4 months.  \nAccording to the health and social services industry profile prepared by the Government of Alberta in 2015, \nthis sector is expected to continue growing at an average rate of 3% per year between 2015 and 2019. That \nrate will be greater than the average growth of the other sectors of the Alberta economy.   \nAs mentioned previously, the Francophone population of Alberta is older than the province’s population. In \nfact, 27.8% of Francophones were 55 or older in 2011, compared to 21% of the population as a whole. \nSeveral Canadian and international studies show a sharp decline in the second language learned (in this \nMARKET STUDY: UNIVERSITY AND COLLEGE PROGRAMS IN HEALTH  66 \n FINAL REPORT – MARCH 2016 \ncase English) among seniors after their retirement. Moreover, seniors with a cognitive disability such as \ndementia gradually lose their ability to communicate in the second language learned.  \nAnother characteristic of the Francophone population in Alberta is the sharp rise in the number of \nFrancophone immigrants who arrived in the province between 2001 and 2011. It must be noted that 41% of \nvery recent immigrants have indicated only French as their FOLS.  \nSeveral studies indicate that language barriers encourage patients to wait before seeking treatment for \nmental health problems.77  According to the study by Sarah Bowen (2015), there is no other field of health \ncare in which diagnosis and treatment are so closely tied to language and culture as mental health.78  \nMost respondents believe that there will be a sharp or moderate expansion of the job market for graduates \nfrom a Francophone or bilingual mental health worker program over the next five to seven years. \nRespondents indicated that the greatest demand for mental health workers would be from the educational \nsector, community health centres and Primary Care Networks.  \nThe profession of mental health worker is not regulated in Alberta. The qualifications for mental health \nworkers can vary considerably. Some are nurses, some are psychologists, and some are social workers.  \nNo college in Alberta offers a mental health worker program as such. Four institutions offer a community \nservice worker or community support worker program, which seems similar at first glance to the mental \nhealth worker program found in other provinces. No French-language or bilingual institutions offer such a \nprogram in French in Western Canada.  \nGiven the promising forecasts regarding the number of positions for social and community service workers \nthat will be created in the province over the next few years, the high percentage of Francophone seniors in \nAlberta (primarily in Edmonton and the northeast and northwest of the province), the high percentage of \nnew immigrants who speak only French as their first official language and who have recently arrived in \nlarge centres such as Calgary and Edmonton, the difficulty finding bilingual mental health workers at this \ntime, the increased social awareness of mental health problems, and the lack of this type of training \nprogram in French in Alberta and Western Canada, Axion recommends that Campus Saint-Jean create a \nmental health worker program to be offered in French. \nMoreover, given that no training programs for mental health workers are currently offered in English in \nAlberta or in Western Canada, we recommend further reflection be undertaken with potential employers \n(school boards, clinics, etc.) to find the exact name of the French-language program. \nOnce again, the Francophones and employers consulted indicated their interest in the offer of a hybrid \nprogram (distance and on-campus) in order to allow Francophones from across Alberta to take the \ntraining.  \n7.

That group is part of the larger “Other technical \noccupations in health care” group (NOC 323).  \nEmergency medical personnel and paramedics administer pre-hospital emergency medical care to patients \nwith injuries or medical illnesses and transport them to hospitals or other medical facilities for further \nmedical care.80 In Alberta, the profession of emergency medical personnel is divided into three levels: \nemergency medical responder (EMR), emergency medical technician (EMT) and emergency medical \ntechnologist-paramedic (EMT-P).  \nEmergency medical personnel and paramedics carry out some or all of the following duties: 81  \n Assess the extent of injuries or medical illnesses or traumas, patients with respiratory disease or \nstress, overdose and poisoning victims, industrial accident victims and other ill or injured \nindividuals to determine emergency medical treatment  \n Comfort and reassure patients  \n Administer pre-hospital emergency care to patients, such as oxygen therapy, cardiopulmonary \nresuscitation (CPR), spinal immobilization, bandaging and splinting  \n Use a cardiac defibrillator  \n Establish and maintain intravenous treatment, apply adjunctive equipment for ventilation and \ncirculation complications, administer medications and provide other advanced emergency \ntreatment to patients  \n Transport patients by air, land or water to hospital or other medical facility for further medical care  \n Collaborate with ambulance dispatch centres, hospital staff, police, firefighters and family \nmembers to ensure relevant information is collected and proper treatment is administered  \n Document and record nature of injuries and illnesses and treatment provided  \n Assist hospital personnel with provision of medical treatment, if necessary  \n Maintain ambulances and emergency care equipment and supplies  \n May train and supervise other workers in this unit group  \n May assist with triage of emergency patients \n7.2 GENERAL CHARACTERISTICS OF THE TARGET SECTOR  \n7.2.1 TYPE OF EMPLOYMENT  \nIn Alberta, emergency medical responders (EMRs) work very seldom in the emergency sector. These \ngraduates are often volunteers in rural communities or have obtained that title while studying as a \nfirefighter or police officer. Emergency medical technicians – ambulance (EMTs) work with ambulance \nservices and emergency services in the industrial sector.

They can sometimes work full-time, sometimes part-time, or even as volunteers for small rural \ncommunities. They work full-time or part=time and can work evenings, weekends and holidays. Their work \nshifts can be 8, 10, 12, 14, or 24 hours.  \nAccording to the 2014 Labour Force Survey, in Canada, 91.6% of emergency medical personnel and \nparamedics work full-time, compared to an average of 81% for all professions.83   \n7.2.2 SALARY  \nAccording to the Alberta Learning Information Service site, the average salary in 2013 at the start of an \nemergency medical or paramedic career was $24.55 per hour and could be as high as $33.54 per hour. The \naverage salary for emergency medical personnel and paramedics was $27.84 per hour or $48,233 per year. \nThe average salary in the health and social services industry was $30,843 per year in 2013.

We spoke with two people who were able to provide us with information regarding this \nsector – an association president and a paramedic working in that field. The interviews took place between \nFebruary 9 and 29, 2016. The survey was not scientific, due to the number of respondents. It was more \nqualitative and focused on the potential for development of a French-language or bilingual training \nprogram for emergency medical personnel and paramedics.  \nDespite numerous efforts, we were unable to talk to human resources staff in the province’s hospitals to \nidentify their labour needs. \n7.5.1 TRAINING OF EMERGENCY MEDICAL PERSONNEL AND \nPARAMEDICS \nAt this time, no training programs for emergency medical personnel and paramedics are offered in French \nin Alberta. It is therefore difficult to find Francophone personnel to serve clients. One respondent \nmentioned the difficult of recruiting bilingual emergency medical personnel, while the other mentioned \nthat he was not aware of a need for bilingual or Francophone paramedic personnel. One respondent stated \nthat it is sometimes difficult to hire bilingual personnel from Quebec, as emergency medical personnel do \nnot receive the same training in Quebec and Alberta. Quebec graduates must take an upgrading course \nbefore practicing in Alberta. According to one respondent, the two best training programs in this field are \nthe courses offered by the Professional Medical Associates (PMA and the one offered by Calgary by SAIT.  \n 7.5.2 FUTURE DEMAND  \nBoth respondents indicated that there will be a sharp or moderate expansion of the job market for \ngraduates from an emergency medical personnel or paramedic program over the next five to seven years. \nThe greatest demand will be for EMR paramedic staff. At this time, employers often recruit from outside \nthe province. The number of graduates is not sufficient to keep up with growth in this sector and to replace \ndepartures. One respondent, however, mentioned that current economic conditions could result in a \nreduction in demand. \nThe respondents indicated that the greatest demand for these professionals would be from the private \nsector, Alberta Health and the industrial sector. One respondent indicated that the region of Girouxville, \n92 Alberta Government.

The summer period (July to November) is the best for hiring new graduates due to forest fires. \n 7.5.3 PREFERRED TYPE OF TRAINING  \nAxion wanted to know the type of training that respondents would prefer for an emergency medical \npersonnel and paramedic program. One respondent did not prefer one option over another, but the other \nrespondent believes that a mix of full-time and part-time training (e.g. one week full-time per month) \nwould be popular. That approach is already used at Northern College. A part-time program would allow \nstudents to continue working during their training.  \nConcerning the type of training (distance or on campus) that would best meet the needs and students and \nemployers, respondents indicated that a combination of distance training and on-campus training would \nmake the program more accessible for Francophones across the province. This would also encourage \ngraduates to remain in their community, and the program would also create fewer constraints for \nemployers.  \nThe respondents believe that it is important for such a program to offer cooperative internship \nopportunities, thus allowing students to experience actual situations.  \n 7.5.4 ADDITIONAL COMMENTS FROM RESPONDENTS  \nThe respondents made comments and suggestions for a potential program to best meet the needs of \nstudents and of the job market. The following points summarize those observations: \n It is important for the program to be properly developed. \n There is a high demand for ambulance transport for seniors who do not have a car, particularly in \nrural areas. \n It is important for graduates to be properly prepared to pass the provincial examination. Many \ngraduates fail and must write the examination several times. \n The North of the province has difficulty attracting and retaining emergency medical personnel. \n At this time, there is no need to increase internal capacity in French for emergency medical \npersonnel, as there is very little demand from clients.  \n7.6 CONDITIONS FOR ACCESS TO THE PROFESSION  \n 7.6.1 REGULATOR BODY  \nIn Alberta, the profession of emergency medical personnel and paramedic is regulated by the Alberta \nCollege of Paramedics.

The program lasts from 3 to 17 weeks. The EMT \n(Emergency Medical Technician – Ambulance) program is a certificate that is usually offered over one year. \nFinally, the EMT-P (Emergency Medical Technologist – Paramedic) program is a diploma that is offered \nover two years.  \nAt this time, 5 colleges offer the two-year program, 7 institutions offer the one-year program and 11 \ncolleges and institutions offer the short EMR program. Some institutions offer the program full-time on \ntheir campus, while other colleges offer alternative teaching methods (online, hybrid, distance, etc.).  \nThe following table presents the programs offered in Alberta in this field.  \nTable 16.

Between 2009 and 2013, growth in this profession varied widely based on the level of \nqualification of personnel. Growth was very high for technicians and technologists, while it was rather low \nfor medical responders.  \nMARKET STUDY: UNIVERSITY AND COLLEGE PROGRAMS IN HEALTH  76 \n FINAL REPORT – MARCH 2016 \nThe emergency medical personnel and paramedics group is expected to see growth of 3.0% by 2017. It is \nexpected that 168 positions will be created each year, in addition to the positions that will become \navailable due to changes in positions, promotions or retirements.  \nAccording to data from the Alberta Learning Information Service, obtained through the 2013 Alberta Wage \nand Salary Survey, 37% of employers seeking to hire emergency medical personnel and paramedics had \ndifficulty finding employees and 19% still had positions available after 4 months. According to the data, the \nvacancy rate for emergency medical personnel and paramedics was at 3% in 2013.   \nAccording to the health and social services industry profile prepared by the Government of Alberta in 2015, \nthis sector is expected to continue growing at an average rate of 3% per year between 2015 and 2019. That \nrate will be greater than the average growth of the other sectors of the Alberta economy.   \nAs mentioned previously, the Francophone population of Alberta is older than the province’s population. In \nfact, 27.8% of Francophones were 55 or older in 2011, compared to 21% of the population as a whole. \nSeveral Canadian and international studies show a sharp decline in the second language learned (in this \ncase English) among seniors after their retirement. As well, seniors with a cognitive disability such as \ndementia gradually lose their ability to communicate in the second language learned. \nRespondents indicated that there will be a sharp or moderate expansion of the job market for graduates \nfrom an emergency medical personnel or paramedic program over the next five to seven years. The \ngreatest demand will be for EMR paramedic staff. The number of graduates is not sufficient to keep up \nwith the growth in this sector and to replace departures. Respondents indicated that the greatest demand \nfor these professionals would be from the private sector, Alberta Health and the industrial sector. One \nrespondent indicated that the region of Girouxville, McLennan and Clare had needs for Francophone or \nbilingual emergency medical personnel or paramedics. According to the respondents, there is a high \ndemand for ambulance transport for seniors who do not have a car, particularly in rural areas. \nIn Alberta, the profession of emergency medical personnel and paramedic is regulated by the Alberta \nCollege of Paramedics. To be recognized as an EMR, EMT or EMT-P, ambulance personnel must have \nsuccessfully completed a training program that meets Alberta College of Paramedics standards and must \npass Alberta College of Paramedics written and practical exams within one year.  \nSeveral programs are offered in Alberta to train emergency medical personnel (EMR, EMT and EMT-P). \nEleven institutions offer the EMR program approved by the Alberta College of Paramedics, seven offer the \nEMT certificate program, and five offer the EMT-P diploma program. No French-language or bilingual \ninstitutions offer these programs in French in Western Canada.  \nGiven the promising forecasts regarding the number of positions for emergency medical personnel and \nparamedics that will be created in the province over the next few years, the high percentage of elderly \nFrancophones in Alberta (primarily in Edmonton and the northeast and northwest of the province), the \ndifficulty finding emergency medical personnel and paramedics at this time, and the lack of \nFrench-language training programs that are offered in Alberta and Western Canada, Axion recommends \nthat Campus Saint-Jean create a training program for emergency medical personnel and paramedic \npersonnel to be offered in French and approved by the Alberta College of Paramedics. \nMARKET STUDY: UNIVERSITY AND COLLEGE PROGRAMS IN HEALTH  77  \nFINAL REPORT – MARCH 2016 \nThe programs that seem most interesting are the certificate programs (Emergency Medical Technician – \nAmbulance or EMT) and diploma programs (Emergency Medical Technologist - Paramedic or EMT-P).  \nOnce again, the people consulted indicated their interest in the offer of a hybrid program (distance and on-\ncampus) in order to allow Francophones from across Alberta to take the training.  \nMARKET STUDY: UNIVERSITY AND COLLEGE PROGRAMS IN HEALTH  78 \n FINAL REPORT – MARCH 2016 \n8.  PRESENTATION OF DATA FOR THE SPEECH LANGUAGE ASSISTANT  COLLEGE \nPROGRAM \n8.1 OCCUPATIONAL PROFILE OF THE TARGET SECTOR  \nAccording to Human Resources and Skills Development Canada,94 speech language assistants are part of \nthe “Health occupations” competency group and the “Other Technical Occupations in Therapy and \nAssessment” unit group in the National Occupational Classification (NOC 3235). That group is part of the \nlarger “Other technical occupations in health care” group (NOC 323).  \nSpeech language assistants implement programs and treatments developed by speech language therapists \nto improve clients’ communication. Their title can vary from speech language assistant to speech-language \npathologist assistant to communication disorders assistant. They work under the supervision of speech \nlanguage therapists.95  \nSpeech language assistants carry out some or all of the following duties: 96 \n Follow treatment plans or protocols established by speech language therapists. \n Work with clients and their families. \n Administer hearing and language tests. \n Prepare material and activities necessary for treatments. \n Coordinate the reservation and setup of assessment and treatment rooms. \n Document and report on client progress. \n Compile statistics.  \n Perform clerical tasks, such as filing, photocopying, and scheduling appointments. \n Order, maintain and inventory supplies and equipment. \n Report to the speech language therapist on clients' progress. \n Assist in organizing public events.  \n 8.2 GENERAL CHARACTERISTICS OF THE TARGET SECTOR  \n8.2.1 TYPE OF EMPLOYMENT  \nAccording to data provided by the Alberta Learning Information Service, 87% of workers in category \n“Other Technical Occupations in Therapy and Assessment” category (NOC 3235) work in health and \ncommunity services and in retail sales.97  There are seen in schools, daycares, preschool programs, \ncommunity health centres, hospitals, rehabilitation centres, and private speech language therapy \npractices. \n94 Service Canada.

The vacancy rate for technical personnel in therapy and assessment was at 14% in \n2013.102  \nAccording to the health and social services industry profile prepared by the Government of Alberta in 2015, \nthis sector is expected to continue growing at an average rate of 3% per year between 2015 and 2019. That \nrate will be greater than the average growth of the other sectors of the Alberta economy.103  \nCanada \nOver the last few years, the number of workers in other technical occupations in therapy and assessment \nhas increased sharply. Besides the factors that influence all occupations in the health sector, those that \nexplain this strong rise in employment vary greatly depending on the many specialties included in this \noccupational group. Employment in this occupational group is expected to continue to grow sharply over \nthe next few years. Unfortunately the speech language assistant group is not large enough to allow \nStatistics Canada to analyze their job prospects.104  \nJob opportunities will result mainly from employment increase, but also from jobs vacated by people in this \noccupational group who are retiring. Other jobs will become available as people change careers. Job \nopportunities will result mainly from employment increase, but also from jobs vacated by people in this \noccupational group who are retiring. Other jobs will become available as people change careers. In fact, the \nunappealing working conditions, such as a very high percentage of part-time jobs, which is close to three \ntimes higher than the average (52% compared with 19%) according to 2011 National Household Survey \ndata, lead many people in this occupation to seek work elsewhere. Finally, some people in this occupation \nwill be promoted to management positions, and if they have the required training, to professional \npositions in their respective fields (speech therapy, physiotherapy, etc.), which will create a few additional \nopportunities.105  \n8.4 QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE LABOUR DATA   \nAccording to the 2011 National Household Survey, in Canada, more than one in two workers (59.3%) in the \nOther Technical Occupations in Therapy and Assessment group (NOC 3235) were self-employed workers, \nwhile the average for all professions was 10.7%.106 \nAccording to the same data, in Canada, women represented 82% of workers in this profession, compared \nto an average of 48% for all professions.

The interviews took \nplace between February 9 and 29, 2016. The survey was not scientific, due to the number of respondents. It \nwas more qualitative and focused on the potential for development of a French-language training program \nfor speech language assistants.  \n108 Alberta Government.

It is \ntherefore very hard to find Francophone personnel to serve clients at Francophone institutions. Two \nrespondents hired speech language assistants in the last five years, one full-time and two part-time. Most \nof those workers had studied in Quebec or were from outside Canada. According to the respondents, it is \nhard to recruit Francophone professionals. School boards that are far from the large centres have difficulty \nattracting and retaining workers.  \n 8.5.2 FUTURE DEMAND  \nMost respondents believe that there will be a sharp or moderate expansion of the job market for graduates \nfrom a speech language assistant program over the next five to seven years. According to the \nrepresentative from the provincial association of speech language assistants, the increase in demand for \nthese professionals is related in part to the ageing population (effects of cerebral hemorrhages, \nconcussions, etc.). Schools are also attentive to the needs of youth in this area.  \nTwo respondents believe that there is a great need for this type of Francophone or bilingual expertise, as \ncommunication in the client’s language is an essential component for speech language assistants. \nRespondents indicated that the greatest demand for speech language assistants would be from the \neducational sector, hospitals, rehabilitation centres, daycares, the preschool sector, and home care \nprograms.  \nTwo of the six respondents also indicated their interest in hiring a total of 1.5 speech language assistants in \nthe next 3 years. One respondent is currently seeking a Francophone speech language therapist.  \n 8.5.3 PREFERRED TYPE OF TRAINING  \nAxion wanted to know the type of training that respondents would prefer for a speech language assistant \nprogram. Respondents did not seem to prefer one option over another. Some mentioned that a part-time \nprogram would allow students to continue working during their training. Another respondent indicated a \npreference for a full-time program so that it would not be too long to take.  \nConcerning the type of training (distance or on campus) that would best meet the needs and students and \nemployers, almost all respondents indicated that a combination of distance training and on-campus \ntraining would make the program more interesting for Francophones across the province. That type of \nprogram would be more financially accessible for many potential students. It would also encourage \ngraduates to remain in their community, and the program would thus create fewer constraints for \nemployers.  \nAll respondents believe that it is important, or even essential, for such a program to offer cooperative \ninternship opportunities that would thus allow students to obtain experience with local employers. \nStudents would also better understand their work and would develop a good network of contacts, which \ncould help them find their first job. Two respondents indicated that their organization could take on \nspeech language assistant interns, mainly in the spring or early summer.  \nMARKET STUDY: UNIVERSITY AND COLLEGE PROGRAMS IN HEALTH  85  \nFINAL REPORT – MARCH 2016 \n 8.5.4 ADDITIONAL COMMENTS FROM RESPONDENTS  \nA few respondents made comments and suggestions for a potential program to best meet the needs of \nstudents and of the job market. The following points summarize those observations: \n There is a need for Francophone health care professionals  \n Students must be open to travelling in their work. \n It is important for the curriculum to correspond to needs and regulations. \n It is important for students to be able to do internships in rural areas.  \n Marketing is needed in French-language high schools to promote careers in health care in French. \n There is little government desire to offer French-language services. Bilingualism is not a criterion at \nthis time when hiring health care professionals. \n8.6 CONDITIONS FOR ACCESS TO THE PROFESSION  \n 8.6.1 REGULATOR BODY  \nThe profession of speech language assistant is not regulated in Alberta.109   \nSome speech language assistants were trained by their employer, but employers prefer to hire staff who \nalready have the knowledge and experienced needed to carry out the duties. The ability to speak other \nlanguages, in addition to English, is an asset for employers. Employers also look for employees who have a \nvalid driver's license and sound knowledge of computers. \nSpeech language assistants can obtain voluntary accreditation from the Therapy Assistant Association of \nAlberta if they obtained their diploma from a program recognized by the Association and if they have \nworked as a speech language assistant for at least 3,000 hours in three years. Moreover, to maintain their \naccreditation, they must take annual training.110  \n 8.6.2 TRAINING AND COMPETITION  \nAt this time in Alberta, only two colleges offer a speech language assistant program that is recognized by \nthe Therapy Assistant Association of Alberta. One is in Edmonton and the other in Medicine Hat.  \nTable 17 presents the programs offered in Alberta in this field.  \n109 Ibid. \n110 Ibid. \nMARKET STUDY: UNIVERSITY AND COLLEGE PROGRAMS IN HEALTH  86 \n FINAL REPORT – MARCH 2016 \nTable 17.

Job prospects are above average and this group is expected to grow by \n3.2% per year by 2017.  \nAccording to data from the Alberta Learning Information Service, obtained through the 2013 Alberta Wage \nand Salary Survey, more than two thirds (68%) of employers seeking to hire technical personnel in therapy \nand assessment had difficulty finding employees and more than one third (39%) still had positions \navailable after 4 months. The vacancy rate for technical occupations in therapy and assessment was at 14% \nin 2013. \nAccording to the health and social services industry profile prepared by the Government of Alberta in 2015, \nthis sector is expected to continue growing at an average rate of 3% per year between 2015 and 2019. That \nrate will be greater than the average growth of the other sectors of the Alberta economy.   \nAs mentioned previously, the Francophone population of Alberta is older than the province’s population. In \nfact, 27.8% of Francophones were 55 or older in 2011, compared to 21% of the population as a whole. \nSeveral Canadian and international studies show a sharp decline in the second language learned (in this \ncase English) among seniors after their retirement. As well, seniors with a cognitive disability such as \ndementia gradually lose their ability to communicate in the second language learned. \nAnother characteristic of the Francophone population in Alberta is the sharp rise in the number of \nFrancophone immigrants who arrived in the province between 2001 and 2011. It must be noted that 41% of \nvery recent immigrants have indicated only French as their FOLS.  \nMost respondents believe that there will be a sharp or moderate expansion of the job market for graduates \nfrom an audiometric assistant program over the next five to seven years. Respondents indicated that the \nMARKET STUDY: UNIVERSITY AND COLLEGE PROGRAMS IN HEALTH  87  \nFINAL REPORT – MARCH 2016 \ngreatest demand for speech language assistants would be from the educational sector, hospitals, \nrehabilitation centres, daycares, the preschool sector, and home care programs.  \nThe profession of speech language assistant is not regulated in Alberta.  \nSpeech language assistants can obtain voluntary accreditation from the Therapy Assistant Association of \nAlberta if they obtained their diploma from a program recognized by the Association and if they have \nworked as a speech language assistant for at least 3,000 hours in three years.  \nAt this time in Alberta, only two colleges offer a speech language assistant program that is recognized by \nthe Therapy Assistant Association of Alberta. One is in Edmonton and the other in Medicine Hat. No \nFrench-language or bilingual institutions offer such a program in French in Western Canada.  \nGiven the promising forecasts regarding the number of positions in the category of Other Technical \nOccupations in Therapy and Assessment (NOC 3235) that will be created in the province over the next few \nyears, the high percentage of Francophone seniors in Alberta (primarily in Edmonton and the northeast \nand northwest of the province), the high percentage of new immigrants who speak only French as their \nfirst official language and who have recently arrived in large centres such as Calgary and Edmonton, the \ndifficulty finding Francophone speech language assistants at this time, and the lack of training programs in \nFrench in Alberta and Western Canada, Axion recommends that Campus Saint-Jean create an \naudiometric assistant program to be offered in French. \nGiven that the pool of jobs for Francophone speech language assistants is nonetheless limited in Alberta \nand Western Canada, it is recommended that the program include courses on language development in \nEnglish and on the phonology of both languages so graduates are able to work in French and in English.  \nOnce again, the people consulted indicated their interest in the offer of a hybrid program (distance and on-\ncampus) in order to allow Francophones from across Alberta to take the training.  \n9.  PRESENTATION OF DATA FOR THE NURSE PRACTITIONER UNIVERSITY PROGRAM \n9.1 OCCUPATIONAL PROFILE OF THE TARGET SECTOR  \nAccording to Human Resources and Skills Development Canada,111 nurse practitioners are part of the \n“Health Occupations” competency group and the “Registered Nurses” unit group in the National \nOccupational Classification (NOC 3152). That group is part of the larger “Nurse Supervisors and Registered \nNurses” group (NOC 315).  \nNurse practitioners are registered nurses who have advanced training in health assessment, health \npromotion and illness prevention. They diagnose and treat health problems, order and interpret tests, and \nanalyze and prescribe drugs.112   \n111 Service Canada.

Most work for Alberta Health in surgery and intensive \ncare in hospitals. Very few are in private practice or work with primary care networks.  \nChart 16. Workplace of nurse practitioners \nNurse practitioners can work in rural and isolated communities. They can work regular hours, be on call for \nemergencies, or work evenings, weekends and/or holidays. The duties of nurse practitioners can be very \nintellectually and emotionally demanding. This type of work also requires good physical resistance.  \n113 Ibid.  \n114 Alberta Health, Nurse Practitioners, 2016. \n65,5 % \n24,5 % \n10 % \nUrban hospitals\nOther\nCommunity health\nMARKET STUDY: UNIVERSITY AND COLLEGE PROGRAMS IN HEALTH  89  \nFINAL REPORT – MARCH 2016 \nAccording to the 2011 National Household Survey, in Canada, 78% of nurse practitioners work full-time, \ncompared to an average of 81% for all professions.115   \n9.2.2 SALARY  \nAccording to the Alberta Learning Information Service site, the average salary in 2013 at the start of a \ncareer for someone in the nurse practitioners group (NOC 3152) was $32.38 per hour and could be as high \nas $52.89 per hour. The average salary for all professions in the NOC 3152 group was $42.60 per hour or \n$63,922 per year. The average salary in the health and social services industry was $30,843 per year in 2013. \nThe average work week for the members of this group was 28.8 hours.

Other barriers cited by the professional associations are federal and \nprovincial laws. Alberta Health is currently developing a strategy to try to eliminate some of those \nobstacles. \nUnfortunately, the low number of nurse practitioners prevents us from establishing reliable projects \nregarding the job market growth to be expected in Alberta over the next few years. \nAccording to the health and social services industry profile prepared by the Government of Alberta in 2015, \nthis sector is expected to continue growing at an average rate of 3% per year between 2015 and 2019. That \nrate will be greater than the average growth of the other sectors of the Alberta economy.118  \nCanada \nDuring the period from 2013 to 2022, projections for the Nurse Supervisors and Registered Nurses group \n(NOC 315) that includes registered nurses (NOC 3152) indicate that the labour market will be experiencing \na labour shortage. It is expected that, across Canada, there will be 156,576 job opportunities that will result \nfrom expansion demand and replacement demand, while there will be 110,130 job seekers.119  \nThere are very few nurse practitioners in the larger Nurse Supervisors and Registered Nurses occupational \ngroup. We therefore cannot extrapolate these projects to the nurse practitioner sub-group. \nHowever, we can state with a high degree of certainty that the ageing population will result in an increase \nin demand for health services, which will be reflected in the demand for health care professionals.  \n118 Ibid., p. 2. \n119 Service Canada.

The interviews took place between February 9 and 29, 2016. \nThe survey was not scientific, due to the number of respondents. It was more qualitative and focused on \nthe potential for development of a French-language or bilingual training program for nurse practitioners.  \nDespite numerous efforts, we were unable to talk to human resources staff in the province’s hospitals to \nidentify their labour needs. \n9.5.1 TRAINING OF NURSE PRACTITIONERS  \nAt this time, no training programs for nurse practitioners are offered in French in Alberta. It is therefore \nvery hard to find Francophone personnel to serve Francophone clients. Two respondents hired a total of 11 \npart-time nurse practitioners in the last five years. All professionals hired had taken a nurse practitioner \nprogram in English in Alberta. The institutions mentioned most often were Athabasca University, the \nUniversity of Lethbridge, the University of Alberta, the University of Calgary, and Grande Prairie College.  \n 9.5.2 FUTURE DEMAND  \n120 Ibid. \n121 Ibid. \n122 Alberta Government.

One respondent felt that there would \nonly be low expansion in this area because, in his opinion, the province does not support the use of this \ntype of professional. Moreover, according to that respondent, 75% of nurse practitioners in the province do \nnot do the work for which they were trained. According to one respondent, there is currently no demand \nfor bilingual nurse practitioners and no job offers mention bilingualism as a hiring criterion. \nRespondents indicated that most demand for nurse practitioners would be from hospitals and long-term \ncare centres.  \nFour of the seven respondents also indicated their interest in hiring a total of 11.5 full-time nurse \npractitioners and 1 part-time nurse practitioner in the next three years.  \n 9.5.3 PREFERRED TYPE OF TRAINING  \nAxion wanted to know the type of training that respondents would prefer for a nurse practitioner program. \nRespondents did not seem to prefer one option over another. A few respondents believe that the program \nshould be offered full-time and part-time.  \nConcerning the type of training (distance or on campus) that would best meet the needs and students and \nemployers, almost all respondents indicated that a combination of distance training and on-campus \ntraining would make the program more interesting for Francophones across the province. That type of \nprogram would be more financially accessible for many potential students. It would also encourage \ngraduates to remain in their community.  \nAll respondents believe that it is important for such a program to offer workplace internship opportunities. \nStudents would thus better understand their work and would develop a good network of contacts, which \ncould help them find their first job. Four respondents stated that their organization could take on an intern \nfrom a nurse practitioner program at any time of the year.  \n 9.5.4 ADDITIONAL COMMENTS FROM RESPONDENTS  \nA few respondents made comments and suggestions for a potential program to best meet the needs of \nstudents and of the job market. The following points summarize those observations: \n It would be important to offer internships in Francophone or bilingual workplaces. \n Marketing is needed in French-language high schools to promote careers in health care in French. \n At this time, there is no need to increase internal capacity in French for nurse practitioners, as \nthere is little demand from clients.  \n There is little government desire to offer French-language services. Bilingualism is not a criterion at \nthis time when hiring health care professionals. \n9.6 CONDITIONS FOR ACCESS TO THE PROFESSION  \n 9.6.1 REGULATOR BODY  \nMARKET STUDY: UNIVERSITY AND COLLEGE PROGRAMS IN HEALTH  93  \nFINAL REPORT – MARCH 2016 \nThe following is required in order to work as a nurse practitioner in Alberta: 123  \n Hold accreditation as a registered nurse from Alberta or from another province or territory \n Have successfully completed a program approved by the Nurse Practitioner Association of Alberta \nor a similar program recognized elsewhere in Canada \n Have passed the Alberta nurse practitioner accreditation exam in one of the three selected areas \n(family/all ages; adult; or pediatric, with neonatal specialty) \nNurse practitioners who obtained their diploma in another province can be authorized to work in Alberta in \ntheir field of expertise. That recognition does not apply to nurse practitioners from Quebec, who must be \nevaluated individually. \n 9.6.2 TRAINING AND COMPETITION  \nAt this time in Alberta, only three universities offer a nurse practitioner program in English.  \nThe following table presents the programs offered in Alberta in this field.  \nTable 18.

However, this occupational group \ngrew by 52.6% between 2009 and 2014.  \n123 Alberta Health, Nurse Practitioners, 2016. \nMARKET STUDY: UNIVERSITY AND COLLEGE PROGRAMS IN HEALTH  94 \n FINAL REPORT – MARCH 2016 \nAccording to the professional nurse practitioners associations, the lack of funding makes it difficult to hire \nnurse practitioners in primary care. Other barriers cited by the professional associations are federal and \nprovincial laws. \nAs mentioned previously, the Francophone population of Alberta is older than the province’s population. In \nfact, 27.8% of Francophones were 55 or older in 2011, compared to 21% of the population as a whole. \nSeveral Canadian and international studies show a sharp decline in the second language learned (in this \ncase English) among seniors after their retirement. As well, seniors with a cognitive disability such as \ndementia gradually lose their ability to communicate in the second language learned. \nMost respondents believe that there will be a sharp or moderate expansion of the job market for graduates \nfrom a nurse practitioner program over the next five to seven years. One respondent felt that there would \nonly be low expansion in this area because, in his opinion, the province does not support the use of this \ntype of professional. Moreover, according to that respondent, 75% of nurse practitioners in the province do \nnot do the work for which they were trained.  \nRespondents indicated that most demand for nurse practitioners would be from hospitals and long-term \ncare centres. Four of the seven respondents also indicated their interest in hiring a total of 11.5 full-time \nnurse practitioners and 1 part-time nurse practitioner in the next three years.  \nThe occupation of nurse practitioner in Alberta requires certification as a registered nurse in Alberta or \nanother province or territory, successful completion of a program approved by the Nurse Practitioner \nAssociation of Alberta or a similar program recognized elsewhere in Canada and a passing mark on the \nAlberta nurse practitioner accreditation exam. \nAt this time in Alberta, only three universities offer a nurse practitioner program in English. No \nFrench-language or bilingual institutions offer such a program in French in Western Canada.  \nIt is difficult to predict the growth in this sector due to the small number of nurse practitioners within the \nlarger category of registered nurses. As well, graduates have difficulty working in their field of expertise \nand there is a lack of provincial funding for hiring this type of professional. Moreover, the sampling of \nemployers interviewed is limited and Axion was unable to obtain information from hospital human \nresource departments. We must also consider the interest shown in this type of profession among the \npeople interviewed (possible creation of 11.5 nurse practitioner positions over three years) and the lack of \ntraining programs in French in Alberta and Western Canada. Therefore, Axion recommends that Campus \nSaint-Jean study the market further before making a decision to create a French or bilingual nurse \npractitioner program. \nMARKET STUDY: UNIVERSITY AND COLLEGE PROGRAMS IN HEALTH  95  \nFINAL REPORT – MARCH 2016 \n10.  PRESENTATION OF DATA FOR THE PSYCHOLOGIST UNIVERSITY PROGRAM \n10.1 OCCUPATIONAL PROFILE OF THE TARGET SECTOR  \nAccording to Human Resources and Skills Development Canada,124 psychologists are part of the major \ngroup “Occupations in Social Science, Education, Government Service and Religion” in the National \nOccupational Classification (NOC 41) and the “Psychologists” unit group (NOC 4151). That group is part of \nthe larger “Psychologists, Social Workers, Counsellors, Clergy and Probation Officers” group (NOC 415).  \nPsychologists assess and diagnose behavioural, emotional and cognitive disorders, counsel clients, provide \ntherapy and research and apply theory relating to behaviour and mental processes. Psychologists help \nclients work toward the maintenance and enhancement of physical, intellectual, emotional, social and \ninterpersonal functioning.125   \nPsychologists carry out some or all of the following duties: 126  \n Examine and assess behaviour, diagnose behavioural, emotional and cognitive disorders, counsel \nclients and provide therapy. \n Help clients deal with an illness or physical disorder. \n Provide counsel to individuals and groups to help them develop and better adapt personally, \nsocially and professionally, and offer mediation services. \n Administer standard psychological tests for assessment purposes. \n Develop and assess intervention programs. \n Apply psychological theories and principles regarding behaviour and mental processes, such as \nlearning, memory, perception, and language development. \n Develop hypotheses and experimental plans, review documentation, conduct studies and publish \nresearch reports, educational texts and articles. \n Give at conferences, workshops and symposiums. \n Provide consulting services to government agencies. \nPsychologists specialize in applied psychology or experimental research. Sub-specialties include \nbehavioural psychology, child psychology, cognitive, educational, school or industrial psychology, social \npsychology, and sports psychology.127  \n124 Service Canada.

They work in mental health clinics, correctional institutions, hospitals, \nprivate practices, rehabilitation centres, schools, post-secondary institutions, and businesses. \nClinical psychologists work in various locations and are required to travel to visit their clients (e.g. in a \nschool environment). Their work schedules can vary based on their clients’ needs. They can work regular \nhours or work evenings and weekends. \nAccording to the 2011 National Household Survey, in Canada, 69.5% of psychologists work full-time, \ncompared to an average of 81% for all professions.128   \n10.2.2 SALARY  \nAccording to the Alberta Learning Information Service site, the average salary in 2013 at the start of a \npsychologist’s career was $44.48 per hour and could be as high as $54.95 per hour. The average salary for \npsychologists was $54.03 per hour, or $90,799 per year. The average salary in the health and social services \nindustry was $30,843 per year in 2013.

This group of professionals grew by \n13.8% between 2009 and 2014. As of December 31, 2015, the average age of psychologists was 49, and \n54.6% were 50 or under. The following chart shows the breakdown of psychologists by gender and age. \nChart 20.

Over the past few years, the number of psychologists \nhas risen sharply. This rise is primarily attributable to the public's much greater sensitivity to social needs: \naging population, mental health, stress, personal growth, home support, dropping out of school, \nbehavioural problems, pathological gambling, homelessness, violence, suicide, exclusion, etc. As this trend \nof sharp increase should be mitigated because of government cuts, it is expected that the number of \npsychologists will increase over the coming years, but at a slower pace than it did in the past.134 \nOpenings will arise mainly from the need to replace psychologists who will be retiring, but also from \nemployment increase. The proportion of psychologists aged 55 and over in 2011 was clearly higher than \nthat of all occupations (29% compared with 18%, according to National Household Survey data). Turnover \nis low. Combined with the appropriate training, experience in this occupation can lead to promotions to \nmanagement positions and can open the way to positions in many occupations: family mediator, teacher, \nguidance counsellor, employment counsellor, management consultant, specialist in human resources, etc. \n10.4 QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE LABOUR DATA   \nAccording to data from Alberta Health for 2015, women held 74.2% of psychologist positions in 2015, while \nthat figure was 44.8% for all professions in Alberta.135  The percentage of women in this profession is \npractically the same as in Canada as a whole (74.5% according to the 2011 National Household Survey).136  \nChart 21.

In 2011, 11.3% of psychologists \nwere immigrants,138 a percentage that is slightly lower than for all professions (13.7%).  \n8.4.1 ESSENTIAL QUALIFICATIONS FOR A PSYCHOLOGIST   \nThe following qualifications and skills are needed to become a psychologist:139  \n A genuine interest in helping others \n Emotional maturity and stability \n Excellent verbal communication  \n Flexibility \n A willingness to learn new methods \n10.5 PRESENTATION OF DATA FROM INTERVIEWS WITH KEY PEOPLE  \nAxion gathered qualitative data by consulting with key people working with psychologists. We spoke with \nseven people who were able to provide us with information regarding this sector – people working for the \nfollowing types of employers: school boards, school associations, community health centres, Francophone \nclinics, early childhood organizations, provincial unions and the provincial association of psychologists. The \ninterviews took place between February 9 and 29, 2016. The survey was not scientific, due to the number \nof respondents. It was more qualitative and focused on the potential for development of a French-\nlanguage or bilingual training program for psychologists.  \nDespite numerous efforts, we were unable to talk to human resources staff in the province’s hospitals to \nidentify their labour needs. \n10.5.1 TRAINING FOR PSYCHOLOGISTS  \nAt this time, no training programs for psychologists are offered in French in Alberta. It is therefore very \nhard to find Francophone personnel to serve Francophone clients. Four respondents hired a total of 12 full-\ntime psychologists and 1 part-time psychologist in the last 5 years. Four of the 12 psychologists were \nbilingual. All of the bilingual professionals hired were from Quebec or Francophone countries. The Alberta \ninstitutions most often mentioned for training for psychologists were the University of Alberta, Athabasca \nUniversity and the University of Calgary.  \nAccording to a few respondents, it is very hard to find Francophone psychologists and even harder to hire \nFrancophone psychologists who also understand and speak English.  \n 10.5.2 FUTURE DEMAND  \n137 Ibid. \n138 Ibid. \n139 Alberta Government.

According to the \nrepresentative from the Psychologists’ Association of Alberta, the province has the largest number of \npsychologists per capita in North America. Despite that, the profession is still expanding in the province, as \npsychologists work in several fields.  \nIn the educational sector, the demand for psychologists could increase with the coming application a new \ninclusive education framework. There is also increased social awareness of mental health needs. Finally, \ngiven the difficult economic situation in Alberta, respondents see even more need to rely on psychologists, \nwho can listen to and help families who are experiencing difficulties.  \nThe respondents indicated that the greatest demand for psychologists will be from private practices, \nschools, mental health centres, hospitals and crisis lines.  \nFour of the seven respondents also indicated their interest in hiring a total of nine full-time psychologists in \nthe next three years. A few respondents indicated that there is an urgent need for bilingual psychologists \nto work in French-language schools. The representative from the Psychologists’ Association of Alberta \nindicated receiving frequent requests for Francophone psychologists.  \n 10.5.3 PREFERRED TYPE OF TRAINING  \nAxion wanted to know the type of training that respondents would prefer for a psychology program. \nRespondents did not seem to prefer one option over another. A few respondents believe that the program \nshould be offered full-time and part-time to meet the needs of a greater number of students. According to \nthe representative from the provincial association, a part-time program would better meet the needs of \nstudents who work full-time.  \nConcerning the type of training (distance or on campus) that would best meet the needs and students and \nemployers, almost all respondents indicated that a combination of distance training and on-campus \ntraining would make the program more interesting for Francophones across the province. It would also \nencourage graduates to remain in their community. \nAll of the respondents believe that it is important for such a program to offer workplace internship \nopportunities. However, it can be difficult to find internships in Francophone environments. Four \nrespondents indicated that their organization could take on an intern form a psychology program at any \ntime of the year.  \n 10.5.4 ADDITIONAL COMMENTS FROM RESPONDENTS  \nA few respondents made comments and suggestions for a potential program to best meet the needs of \nstudents and of the job market. The following points summarize those observations: \n It would be important to offer internships in Francophone or bilingual workplaces. \n Marketing is needed in French-language high schools to promote careers in health care in French. \n Graduates must be fully bilingual. \n Students must be available to travel in their work. \n Graduates must understand the reality of social inclusion in order to meet the needs of youth. \nMARKET STUDY: UNIVERSITY AND COLLEGE PROGRAMS IN HEALTH  101  \nFINAL REPORT – MARCH 2016 \n The importance of working as a team and collaborating must be taught. \n Knowledge is needed of the reality of life in a minority language situation. \n Justification for a French-language psychology program could encourage the government to agree \nto create a university program in that field. \n There is little government desire to offer French-language services. Bilingualism is not a criterion at \nthis time when hiring health care professionals. \n10.6 CONDITIONS FOR ACCESS TO THE PROFESSION  \n 10.6.1 REGULATOR BODY  \nThe occupation of psychologist in Alberta requires accreditation from the College of Alberta Psychologists \n(CAP). The following is required for such accreditation: 140  \n A master’s degree in psychology that meets CAP academic criteria. \n At least 1,600 hours of work under the supervision of an accredited psychologist recognized by the \nCAP. \n Passing a clinical or theoretical psychology examination approved by the CAP. \nPsychologists who received their diploma in another province can be authorized to work in Alberta if the \nskills required and the responsibilities are similar in both jurisdictions. \n 10.6.2 TRAINING AND COMPETITION  \nAlberta and Quebec are the only provinces where a psychologist can practice the profession with a \nmaster’s degree and not a doctorate. According to the representative from the Psychologists’ Association \nof Alberta, Quebec and Alberta offer a practical program that focusses less on research. At this time, six \nuniversities offer a master’s program in psychology. Four are Alberta universities, while the other two are \nforeign universities that offer a master’s program in the province.  \nThe following table presents the programs offered in Alberta in this field.  \nTable 19.

This group of professionals grew by \n13.8% between 2009 and 2014. As of December 31, 2015, the average age of psychologists was 49, and \n54.6% were 50 or younger. Just over 45% of psychologists (1,192) will be of retirement age in the next five \nyears.  \nAccording to data from the Alberta Learning Information Service, obtained through the 2013 Alberta Wage \nand Salary Survey, 38% of employers seeking to hire psychologists had difficulty finding employees and \n9% still had positions available after 4 months. The vacancy rate for psychologist positions was at 3% in \n2013. \nAccording to the health and social services industry profile prepared by the Government of Alberta in 2015, \nthis sector is expected to continue growing at an average rate of 3% per year between 2015 and 2019. That \nrate will be greater than the average growth of the other sectors of the Alberta economy.  \nMARKET STUDY: UNIVERSITY AND COLLEGE PROGRAMS IN HEALTH  103  \nFINAL REPORT – MARCH 2016 \nAs mentioned previously, the Francophone population of Alberta is older than the province’s population. In \nfact, 27.8% of Francophones were 55 or older in 2011, compared to 21% of the population as a whole. \nSeveral Canadian and international studies show a sharp decline in the second language learned (in this \ncase English) among seniors after their retirement. As well, seniors with a cognitive disability such as \ndementia gradually lose their ability to communicate in the second language learned. \nAnother characteristic of the Francophone population in Alberta is the sharp rise in the number of \nFrancophone immigrants who arrived in the province between 2001 and 2011. It must be noted that 41% of \nvery recent immigrants have indicated only French as their FOLS.  \nAll respondents believe that there will be a sharp or moderate expansion of the job market for graduates \nfrom a psychology program over the next five to seven years. The respondents indicated that the greatest \ndemand for psychologists will be from private practices, schools, mental health centres, hospitals and crisis \nlines. Four of the seven respondents also indicated their interest in hiring a total of nine full-time \npsychologists in the next three years. The representative from the Psychologists’ Association of Alberta \nindicated receiving frequent requests for Francophone psychologists.  \nThe occupation of psychologist in Alberta requires accreditation from the College of Alberta Psychologists \n(CAP). To obtain accreditation, the person must have a master’s degree in psychology that meets CAP \nacademic criteria, have worked at least 1,600 hours under the supervision of an accredited psychologist \nrecognized by CAP, and have passed an exam in clinical or theoretical psychology approved by CAP.  \nAlberta and Quebec are the only provinces where a psychologist can practice the profession with a \nmaster’s degree and not a doctorate. At this time, six universities offer a master’s program in psychology. \nFour are Alberta universities, while the other two are foreign universities. No French-language or bilingual \ninstitutions offer such a program in French in Western Canada.  \nGiven the promising forecasts regarding the number of psychologist positions that will be created in the \nprovince over the next few years, the large number of psychologists who will be of retirement age in the \nnext five years, the high percentage of Francophone seniors in Alberta (primarily in Edmonton and the \nnortheast and northwest of the province), the high percentage of new immigrants who speak only French \nas their first official language and who have recently arrived in large centres such as Calgary and \nEdmonton, the difficulty finding Francophone psychologists at this time, and the lack of training programs \nin French in Alberta and Western Canada, Axion recommends that Campus Saint-Jean create a master \nof psychology program. \nOnce again, the people consulted indicated their interest in the offer of a hybrid program (distance and on-\ncampus) in order to allow Francophones from across Alberta to take the training.  \nMARKET STUDY: UNIVERSITY AND COLLEGE PROGRAMS IN HEALTH  104 \n FINAL REPORT – MARCH 2016 \n11.

This group of professionals grew by 23.8% \nbetween 2009 and 2014. As of December 31, 2015, the average age of dietitians was 39, making it a very \nyoung profession; 80.9% of dietitians were 50 or younger. The following chart shows the breakdown of \ndietitians by gender and age. \nChart 24. Demographic breakdown of dietitians in Alberta149 \nThe Alberta Learning Information Service has no statistics regarding the predicted growth rate for the \nprofession over the next few years.  \nAccording to the health and social services industry profile prepared by the Government of Alberta in 2015, \nthis sector is expected to continue growing at an average rate of 3% per year between 2015 and 2019.

In recent years, the number of dietitians and \nnutritionists has increased sharply. This increase may be explained by the aging of the population, growing \npublic concern about healthy eating, increased government spending in the health sector, the \nexacerbation of health problems due to obesity and the growing use of the services of dieticians to prevent \nand treat health problems. Given that most of these trends should continue, the number of dietitians and \nnutritionists should increase sharply over the next few years. Government budget cuts could, however, \nmitigate the extent of the increase.151  \nOpenings will arise mainly from employment increase and, to a lesser degree, from positions left vacant by \ndietitians and nutritionists who are retiring or leaving the occupation to become managers. \nThese openings will be accessible mainly to university graduates. In fact, few experienced unemployed \ndietitians and nutritionists will apply for these vacant positions, since the unemployment rate is very low in \nthis occupation. \n11.4 QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE LABOUR DATA   \nAccording to data from Alberta Health for 2015, women held 96.9% of dietitian positions, while that figure \nwas 44.8% for all professions in Alberta.152  \nThe percentage of women in this profession is practically the same as in Canada as a whole (95.6% \naccording to the 2011 National Household Survey).153  \nChart 25.

In 2011, 10.5% of dietitians \nwere immigrants, a percentage that is slightly lower than for all professions (13.7%).155  \n154 Ibid. \n155 Ibid. \nMARKET STUDY: UNIVERSITY AND COLLEGE PROGRAMS IN HEALTH  109  \nFINAL REPORT – MARCH 2016 \n11.4.1 ESSENTIAL QUALIFICATIONS FOR A PSYCHOLOGIST   \nThe following qualifications and skills are needed to become a dietitian:156  \n An interest in science and foods \n Good verbal communication \n Innovation and flexibility \n Honesty, ethics and caring \n Good critical thinking \n Self-assurance, sincerity and diplomacy \n Practicality and focus on results \nDietitians must also enjoy coordinating and developing educational programs, analyzing information, \nsolving problems and working with people. \n11.5 PRESENTATION OF DATA FROM INTERVIEWS WITH KEY PEOPLE  \nAxion gathered qualitative data by consulting with key people working with dietitians. We spoke with six \npeople who were able to provide us with information regarding this sector – people working for the \nfollowing types of employers: retirement homes, Francophone clinic, primary care network, mental health \norganizations, provincial unions and the provincial association of dietitians. The interviews took place \nbetween February 9 and 29, 2016. The survey was not scientific, due to the number of respondents. It was \nmore qualitative and focused on the potential for development of a French-language training program for \ndietitians.  \nDespite numerous efforts, we were unable to talk to human resources staff in the province’s hospitals to \nidentify their labour needs. \n11.5.1 TRAINING FOR DIETITIANS  \nAt this time, no training programs for dietitians are offered in French in Alberta. It is therefore very hard to \nfind Francophone personnel to serve Francophone clients. Two respondents hired a total of 11 full-time \ndietitians in the last five years. The primary care network alone hired 10 of the 11 dietitians, one of whom \nwas bilingual. Almost all of the dietitians were trained at the University of Alberta, where the program is in \nEnglish. The Alberta institutions most often mentioned for training for dietitians were the University of \nAlberta and Athabasca University.  \nAccording to one respondent, it is difficult to find Francophone dietitians, as the pool of Francophone \ngraduates is smaller.  \n 11.5.2 FUTURE DEMAND  \nAlmost all respondents believe that there will be a sharp or moderate expansion of the job market for \ngraduates from a dietitian program over the next five to seven years.  \n156 Alberta Government. OCCinfo: Occupations and Educational Programs. \nhttp://occinfo.alis.alberta.ca/occinfopreview/info/browse-occupations/occupation-profile.html?id=71002221. Site accessed in \nMarch 2016. \nhttp://occinfo.alis.alberta.ca/occinfopreview/info/browse-occupations/occupation-profile.html?id=71002221\nMARKET STUDY: UNIVERSITY AND COLLEGE PROGRAMS IN HEALTH  110 \n FINAL REPORT – MARCH 2016 \nThe representative from the provincial association of dietitians estimates that there will be strong \nexpansion in demand for dietitians due to the ageing population and the increase in chronic illnesses \nassociated with ageing. Only one respondent believes that demand will remain stable over the next five to \nseven years due to economic conditions and slowing population growth.  \nRespondents indicated that the greatest demand for dietitians will be from primary care networks, \nhospitals, retirement homes, mental health centres, long-term care facilities, home care programs, private \npractices, and community health centres.  \n 11.5.3 PREFERRED TYPE OF TRAINING  \nAxion wanted to know the type of training that respondents would prefer for a dietitian program. \nRespondents did not seem to prefer one option over another. A few respondents believe that the program \nshould be offered full-time and part-time to meet the needs of a greater number of students. According to \nthe representative from the provincial association, a part-time program would better meet the needs of \nstudents who work full-time, particularly new residents, for whom it is important to be able to study while \nworking.  \nConcerning the type of training (distance or on campus) that would best meet the needs and students and \nemployers, almost all respondents indicated that a combination of distance training and on-campus \ntraining would make the program more interesting for Francophones across the province. It would also \nencourage graduates to remain in their community.  \nAccording to the representative from the provincial association, the program cannot be offered completely \nthrough distance learning, as students must also have practical training on-campus.  \nAll respondents believe that it is important for such a program to offer workplace internship opportunities. \nHowever, it can be difficult to find internships in a Francophone environment. One respondent indicated \nthat his organization could take on an intern dietitian at any time of the year.  \n 11.5.4 ADDITIONAL COMMENTS FROM RESPONDENTS  \nA few respondents made comments and suggestions for a potential program to best meet the needs of \nstudents and of the job market. The following points summarize those observations: \n It would be important to offer internships in Francophone or bilingual workplaces. \n Marketing is needed in French-language high schools to promote careers in health care in French. \n Graduates must be fully bilingual. \n Future graduates must be available to travel in their work. \n There is no part-time dietitian program outside Edmonton, and that is a problem at this time. \n At this time, there is no need to increase internal capacity in French for dietitians, as there is very \nlittle demand from clients.  \n There is little government desire to offer French-language services. Bilingualism is not a criterion at \nthis time when hiring health care professionals. \nMARKET STUDY: UNIVERSITY AND COLLEGE PROGRAMS IN HEALTH  111  \nFINAL REPORT – MARCH 2016 \n11.6 CONDITIONS FOR ACCESS TO THE PROFESSION  \n 11.6.1 REGULATOR BODY  \nTo work as a dietitian in Alberta, accreditation is required from the College of Dietitians of Alberta (CDA). \nThe following is required for such accreditation:157  \n A bachelor’s or master’s degree in food science or nutrition approved by the CDA  \n Have completed an internship of 35 to 40 weeks in an accredited Canadian internship program, \nunder the supervision of an accredited dietitian \n Have passed the Canadian Dietetic Registration Examination \nDietitians who received their diploma in another province can be authorized to work in Alberta if the skills \nrequired and the responsibilities are similar in both jurisdictions. \n 11.6.2 TRAINING AND COMPETITION  \nIn Alberta, only the University of Alberta offers a Nutrition and Food Sciences program accredited by the \nCDA. It is also the only university to offer an integrated internship program recognized by the CDA. \nStudents access that program through a competitive process in their third year of university studies. The \ninternship is a prerequisite to work as an accredited dietitian in the province.  \nThe following table presents the program offered in Alberta in this field.  \nTable 20.

This group of professionals grew by 23.8% \nbetween 2009 and 2014. As of December 31, 2015, the average age of dietitians was 39, making it a very \nyoung profession; 80.9% of dietitians were 50 or younger.  \nThe Alberta Learning Information Service has no statistics regarding the predicted growth rate for the \nprofession over the next few years. However, according to the health and social services industry profile \nprepared by the Government of Alberta in 2015, this sector is expected to continue growing at an average \n157 College of Dietitians of Alberta.

That rate will be greater than the average growth of the other \nsectors of the Alberta economy.  \nAs mentioned previously, the Francophone population of Alberta is older than the province’s population. In \nfact, 27.8% of Francophones were 55 or older in 2011, compared to 21% of the population as a whole. As \nwell, a greater proportion of seniors live in Edmonton and the Northeast and Northwest parts of the \nprovince.  \nThe percentage of obese people in the North is much higher than the provincial average, according to data \nfrom 2013 (27.4% for the North vs. 19.3% for Alberta as a whole).  \nSeveral Canadian and international studies show a sharp decline in the second language learned (in this \ncase English) among seniors after their retirement. As well, seniors with a cognitive disability such as \ndementia gradually lose their ability to communicate in the second language learned. \nAnother characteristic of the Francophone population in Alberta is the sharp rise in the number of \nFrancophone immigrants who arrived in the province between 2001 and 2011. It must be noted that 41% of \nvery recent immigrants have indicated only French as their FOLS.  \nAlmost all respondents believe that there will be a sharp or moderate expansion of the job market for \ngraduates from a dietitian program over the next five to seven years.  \nRespondents indicated that the greatest demand for dietitians will be from primary care networks, \nhospitals, retirement homes, mental health centres, long-term care facilities, home care programs, private \npractices, and community health centres.  \nTo work as a dietitian in Alberta, accreditation is required from the College of Dietitians of Alberta (CDA). \nTo obtain accreditation, the person must have a bachelor or master’s degree in food sciences or nutrition \napproved by the CDA, have completed an internship of 35 to 40 weeks in an accredited Canadian \ninternship program, under the supervision of an accredited dietitian, and have passed the Canadian \nDietetic Registration Examination. \nIn Alberta, only the University of Alberta offers a Nutrition and Food Sciences program accredited by the \nCDA. It is also the only university to offer an integrated internship program recognized by the CDA. No \ninstitutions offer such a program in French in the province or in Western Canada.  \nGiven the growth seen in this profession between 2009 and 2014 and the expansion anticipated by \nrespondents to the survey over the next few years, the increase in health problems due to obesity and the \nincreased use of dietitian services to prevent and treat health problems, the high percentage of \nFrancophone seniors in Alberta (primarily in Edmonton and the northeast and northwest of the province), \nthe high percentage of obese people in the North, the high percentage of new immigrants who speak only \nFrench as their first official language and who have recently arrived in large centres such as Calgary and \nEdmonton, the difficulty finding Francophone dietitians at this time, and the lack of training programs in \nFrench in Alberta and Western Canada, Axion recommends that Campus Saint-Jean create a bachelor of \nnutrition program. \nOnce again, the people consulted indicated their interest in the offer of a hybrid program (distance and on-\ncampus) in order to allow Francophones from across Alberta to take the training.   \nMARKET STUDY: UNIVERSITY AND COLLEGE PROGRAMS IN HEALTH  113  \nFINAL REPORT – MARCH 2016 \n13. POOL OF POTENTIAL STUDENTS  \nNot only is it important to study the demand for French-language programs in health in Alberta, but it is \nalso important to obtain data regarding the pool of potential students.  \nFirst, we studied the number of youth attending French-language schools in the Western provinces and the \nterritories. The following table shows that nearly 21,000 students study there in French. Ove the last year, \nthere has been a 4% increase in the number of students attending such schools.  \nTable 21. Number of youth attending French-language schools in Western and Northern Canada158 \nProvince or Territory \nNumber \n2014-2015 \nNumber \n2015-2016 \nAnnual increase \nBritish Columbia 5,382 5,546 3.05% \nAlberta 7,158 7,728 8% \nYukon 224 244 8.93% \nNorthwest Territories 223 218 -2.24% \nSaskatchewan 1,878 1,813 -3.46% \nManitoba 5,212 5,340 2.46% \nTotal  20,077 20,889 4% \nIn the same vein, in 2013-2014, more than 300,000 youth were registered in a French immersion program in \nthe West and the North.  \nTable 22.

The \nprograms must also be presented in an innovative manner in order to meet the needs of Francophone \nstudents throughout Alberta and elsewhere in the West. Competition is fierce. Youth have a wide choice of \nprograms and institutions. Campus Saint-Jean must therefore position itself as a hub for health programs \nin French in Western and Northern Canada.  \nCONCLUSION AND GENERAL RECOMMENDATIONS \nFollowing the preparation of a demographic profile of Francophones in Alberta and the consultations \nconducted with the various Francophone communities around the province, it is clear that there is \ncurrently a lack of health professionals who are able to serve the province’s Francophone community. \nThis first finding helped identify eight areas in which Francophone or bilingual health professionals could \nhelp improve the health services offered to the province’s Francophone population.  \nAxion recommends the creation of the following programs based on the eight separate market studies \nconducted. \nTable 23.

The \nuniversity’s new strategic plan, For the Public Good, articulates the central goal to provide education \nand research that is truly transformative to the respective groups it serves: students, the community, \nour province, country and the world.  \nThis driving mandate is in alignment with key Government of Alberta priorities to diversify the \nprovincial economy, lead on humanity’s grand challenges—such as climate change,  educate and \ntrain citizens to compete in the global economy, build safe and inclusive communities, and create \nhealth and social wellbeing. \nWe are a diverse and inclusive community with a far-reaching impact. \nThe multi-campus University of Alberta plays a pivotal role in Alberta’s post-secondary system, \neducating the citizens that serve in our social, industrial and corporate sectors. With over 29,000 \nundergraduate and 7,000 graduate students, over 600 post-doctoral fellows, over 2,000 full-time \nfaculty members in 18 faculties, and 15,000-plus employees, the U of A is Alberta’s fourth-largest \nemployer and has an economic impact of $12.3 billion per year in Alberta.  \nThe university prizes excellence in teaching and is first among Canadian universities with 41 3M \nTeaching Fellowship winners, Canada’s highest honour for undergraduate teaching. The U of A \nembraces community engagement. Last year, over 1,500 students participated in Community \nService-Learning with over 180 community partners.  \nWe are a leading research enterprise. \nWith over $4.6 billion in sponsored research over the last decade, U of A researchers have \nproduced numerous game-changing discoveries such as the world-famous Edmonton Protocol \ntreatment for Type 1 Diabetes; received $75 million to launch Future Energy Systems to build on the \nuniversity’s broad energy and environmental expertise to innovate towards a zero-carbon future; \ndiscovered the first life-saving antiviral therapy for hepatitis B; and attracted the largest joint \nresearch gift in U of A history—$54 million—for the Women’s and Children’s Health Research \nInstitute, which mobilizes ground-breaking research into changes in practice that improve the health \nof women and children the world over.  \nWe solve problems. \nAcross a wide range of issues, the university takes a multi-faceted approach to solving relevant \nproblems. A $14 million facility in Edmonton is building on research based in the Faculty of \nAgricultural, Life & Environmental Sciences to deploy innovative technologies that use crops to \nproduce nutraceuticals, pharmaceuticals, and cosmetics, increasing economic diversity and \ninvestment in the agricultural sector. The Alberta Cell Therapy Manufacturing facility, the only facility \nof its kind in western Canada, will produce clinical grade human cell and tissue products—offering \nhope for a host of regenerative treatments for diseases ranging from cancer to cardiovascular \nCOMPREHENSIVE INSTITUTIONAL PLAN 2017-20                                                              5 \nC OMPR E HE N S I VE  I NS T I TU T ION A L  PL A N  -  DR A FT \ndisease to neurological disorders. A breakthrough technology using feed stock—animal fat, beef \ntallow, restaurant grease—has been pioneered, allowing this waste to be converted into the next \ngeneration of renewable fuels and creating value-added products for Alberta’s economy. The U of \nA’s Protective Clothing and Equipment Research Facility tests and develops fabrics for extreme \nenvironments, such as forest fire-fighting, and the Western Partnership for Wildland Fire Science \nstudies the fires themselves—each aspect supporting the work of the other as well as the work of \nAlbertans handling real crises in the province. \nFundamentally, the university’s far-ranging work is conducted within the mandate of its role in the \nsix-sector system and embraces the Province of Alberta’s Adult Learning System Principles.  \nThe 2017 Comprehensive Institutional Plan presents the university’s priorities for the next three \nyears according to each of the principles. Highlights of these include:  \nAccessibility   \nThe U of A provides access to a full range of foundational programs, specialized professional \nprograms, and graduate programs that drive research and innovation. By ensuring the availability of \na wide array of programs within the province, we support a diversity of career aspirations and wider \neconomic objectives. It is a priority to ensure that the U of A is accessible and that the wellness of \nour community is enhanced, recognizing that all students, and particularly under-represented \ncohorts, are served by improved supports, communication, facilities, and infrastructure. The \nuniversity directly supports accessibility through a robust system of financial supports, administering \napproximately $90 million in scholarship and bursary funding.  \nA key accessibility goal is an action-oriented response to the final report of the Truth and \nReconciliation Commission of Canada, one that achieves meaningful change for Indigenous \nstudents, staff, and faculty. Through dedicated hiring, community outreach, student supports, and \npartnerships with Indigenous post-secondary institutions, we are committed to closing the long-\nstanding educational attainment gap between Indigenous and non-Indigenous people.  \nWe will also address equity through improved recruitment and hiring practices that identify and \naddress systematic biases that discourage diversity. We will increase the proportion of women, \nvisible minorities, and persons with disabilities among our faculty, staff, and students. We will launch \na university-wide wellness strategy to enhance wellbeing, safety, and security, and will continue \nimplementation of recommendations from a 2015 review of sexual assault support services.  \nAffordability   \nThe University of Alberta supports affordability through direct financial support to students—over $89 \nmillion in annual student bursaries and awards—and by ensuring the efficiency and sustainability of \nour programs, services, and infrastructure. Efficient administration and financial stewardship enable \nus to devote scarce resources to academic programming and to student services and supports, \nminimizing organizational costs that must be supported through our tuition base. With economic \ngrowth, cost pressures must be managed to align resources and needs with natural and pervasive \ninflationary effects to produce the stable development of fee structures.  \nIn the next three years, our priorities relating to affordability include: securing funding to support key \nstrategic goals; upgrading IT infrastructure to increase service reliability to the U of A community and \nto extend reach to partner institutions and isolated communities; enhancing transparency and \nconsultation within the university to promote efficiencies and evidence-based decision-making \nacross the institution; and renewing key physical infrastructure through our Capital Plan, which is \nfocused on asset renewal to drive efficient space utilization and meet program needs sustainably. \nCOMPREHENSIVE INSTITUTIONAL PLAN 2017-20                                                              6 \nC OMPR E HE N S I VE  I NS T I TU T ION A L  PL A N  -  DR A FT \nQuality   \nThe University of Alberta is committed to quality across our teaching, research, and administrative \nfunctions. Our global ranking reflects our reputation for excellence, and we remain committed to \nattracting world-class faculty and research to support the best and brightest students from Alberta, \nCanada, and the world. Our research enterprise in particular is a major driver of Alberta’s innovation \nand economic diversification for the future.  \nCentral to our quality agenda is a process to identify and support signature areas of research and \nteaching excellence. These are areas of local, national, and global relevance in which the U of A is, \nor is emerging as, a world leader with a critical mass of scholars and students. Identifying signature \nareas will enable us to focus resources strategically to maximize our impact and our success \npursuing major funding opportunities. To ensure the long-term sustainability of our professoriate, we \nare committed to developing a faculty renewal program, with an initial focus on increasing our \nproportion of Assistant Professors and achieving equity and diversity in the academy. The university \nis driving quality and innovation in teaching through initiatives such as an enhanced focus on \nexperiential learning, ensuring that our graduates are exposed to many environments and develop \nworld-ready skills.  \nCoordination   \nAs the province’s largest post-secondary institution, the U of A embraces its leadership role within a \ndifferentiated Campus Alberta system. Examples of our collaborations with Campus Alberta partners \ninclude: hosting of the Olds College PeopleSoft financial system; provision of the moodle Learning \nManagement System to four institutions; support for the Norquest College capital expansion project \nthrough provision of project management, design and operational review, business case \ndevelopment, construction delivery advisement and procurement assistance; and, through TEC \nEdmonton, collaboration with NAIT to share infrastructure in supporting commercialization. \nIn the next three years, specific goals include strengthening relationships with Indigenous post-\nsecondaries in Alberta, with rural and remote learners through IT supports, and with Alberta Health \nServices to enhance health-related teaching, learning, and continuous education opportunities within \nboth organizations.  \nAs a community of over 50,000 individuals, we also promote and embrace coordination across our \nfive campuses, 18 faculties, and multiple administrative units. This is a key driver for our \nadministrative and information technology goals over the next three years.  \nAccountability   \nThe University of Alberta is responsible and accountable to the Government of Alberta and other \ninvestors for our funding. As a top 100 global university, the University of Alberta is also accountable \nto researchers, scholars, teachers, industries and other organizations to fulfill its mandate to \ncontinuously generate new knowledge and new scientific discoveries. From dinosaurs to islet \ntransplants to ease the burden of Type 1 diabetes; to the University Hospital’s strength as a centre \nfor organ transplants and cardiac care; from bitumen extraction from the oilsands to the finest live \ntheatre acting program in Canada; communities and organizations look to the university for \ninnovation, discoveries, and for talented graduates who will carry those organizations forward.  \nIn the next three years, the U of A will focus on both fiscal and social accountability. To drive long-\nterm stewardship, we are undertaking to revise our budget model and to continue to diversify our \nfunding sources and donor base. Socially, we are committed to changing the university environment \nto be more supportive of Indigenous people and new Canadians, and to contribute to the necessary \ndevelopment of economic and social diversity in Edmonton and in Alberta.  \nCOMPREHENSIVE INSTITUTIONAL PLAN 2017-20                                                              7 \nC OMPR E HE N S I VE  I NS T I TU T ION A L  PL A N  -  DR A FT \nACCOUNTABILITY STATEMENT \nThis Comprehensive Institutional Plan was prepared under the Board’s direction in accordance with \nlegislation and associated ministerial guidelines, and in consideration of all policy decisions and \nmaterial, economic, or fiscal implications of which the Board is aware. \nMichael Phair \nChair, Board of Governors \nCOMPREHENSIVE INSTITUTIONAL PLAN 2017-20                                                              8 \nC OMPR E HE N S I VE  I NS T I TU T ION A L  PL A N  -  DR A FT \nINSTITUTIONAL CONTEXT \nUniversity of Alberta Mandate \nCreated by the University Act, 1906, of the Legislative Assembly of the Province of Alberta, the \nUniversity of Alberta is a board-governed, publicly-funded, multi-campus university that operates as \na Comprehensive Academic and Research Institution under the authority of Alberta’s Post-\nSecondary Learning Act. Its fundamental mandate is to offer a broad range of outstanding learning \nand research programs to prepare citizens and leaders who will make a difference. The university \nplays a leading role in Campus Alberta through collaboration with other Alberta institutions, \nresponding to vital community relationships at every level and giving a national and international \nvoice to Alberta innovation. Its activities enhance the range and quality of student opportunities, and \nbuild Alberta’s capacity for long-term, knowledge-driven, sustainable development at the global \nforefront. \nThe university provides instructional excellence through both on-campus and distance delivery in a \nvibrant and supportive learning and research environment. Its residential, multi-campus setting \nincludes many research and field facilities. The university community discovers, disseminates, and \napplies new knowledge through interrelated core activities. \nIn a dynamic and integrated learning and research environment, the University of Alberta offers \ngraduate and undergraduate students the opportunity to earn internationally respected credentials, \nincluding bachelor’s, master’s and doctoral degrees, and university certificates and diplomas. It also \noffers French-language programs leading to university degrees, certificates, and diplomas, as well \nas college certificates and diplomas. A number of its programs are unique within Alberta and \nwestern Canada. Post-doctoral fellows come to the university to refine their teaching, mentoring, and \nresearch skills. \nThe University of Alberta is a balanced multi-campus academy, with strong arts and sciences \nprograms featuring the Faculties of Agricultural, Life and Environmental Sciences, Arts, Augustana, \nExtension, Native Studies, Physical Education and Recreation, Science, and Campus Saint-Jean. \nThese faculties are foundational to and interlinked with the university’s network of strong \nprofessional faculties, including Business, Education, Engineering, Graduate Studies and Research, \nLaw, Medicine and Dentistry, Nursing, Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences, Public Health, and \nRehabilitation Medicine. In addition, all of our faculties are involved in professional development and \ncontinuing education. \nThe university establishes and maintains an environment of inquiry-based learning anchored in \nstrong academic programming and an array of co-curricular student life opportunities. Academic \nsupport, social and community enrichment, health and wellness, and career and life development \nare cornerstones of the University of Alberta student experience. The intellectual and creative \ndiversity of the campus, including its international and multi-cultural population and exchange \nprograms, makes for an engaging student experience. Fine arts displays, stage performances, \nmuseum collections, athletics, and recreational opportunities combine with residence life to present \nmulti-dimensional possibilities. Experiential learning opportunities based in the community augment \non-campus activities with real-life applications. \nTransfer and collaborative degree completion agreements with partner institutions broaden student \nopportunities and provide rural, northern, and Indigenous communities with access to University of \nAlberta programs. Similar innovative arrangements centred at the university deliver information and \nCOMPREHENSIVE INSTITUTIONAL PLAN 2017-20                                                              9 \nC OMPR E HE N S I VE  I NS T I TU T ION A L  PL A N  -  DR A FT \nknowledge resources to post-secondary and government communities through our Libraries and \nhighly-trained librarians using inter-library loans and online access. \nThe university’s research and creative activities produce a dual impact through the preparation of \nhighly- qualified graduates and a continuous flow of innovation. The university attracts scholars of \ninternational reputation: undergraduate and graduate students, post-doctoral fellows, staff, and \nfaculty. Collectively, they foster, conduct, and disseminate research and creative activity, both pure \nand applied, within and across all the major program areas at an internationally recognized level of \nexcellence.  \nUniversity faculties, centres, and institutes combine resources and talents for collaborative \nadvantage through research partnerships with other academic institutions, business, governments, \nand public agencies. The Centre for Entrepreneurship and Family Enterprise is dedicated to \nunderstanding family businesses—often the seeds economic development. The university actively \ntransfers new knowledge and creative works to Alberta, Canada, and the world for community \nbenefit, including commercial development of intellectual property when appropriate and feasible. \nResearch and innovation are core contributors to Alberta’s economic growth and sustainability. \nIn every aspect of its mandate, the University of Alberta partners with the province of Alberta in \nsocial, cultural, and economic development, fostering and establishing the provincial, national, and \ninternational connections and understanding that support leading global enterprise and citizenship \nfor Albertans. University administrators, faculty, staff, and students contribute regularly to public \ndebate and to government and corporate examination of issues. Start-up companies and new \ntechnologies licensed to existing companies lead Alberta in new directions and employ graduates. \nThe university continually moves out into its communities through its graduates, its creative and \nresearch advances, and its ongoing opportunities for experiential and lifelong learning. \nAs approved by the Minister of Advanced Education and Technology, July 2009 \nUniversity of Alberta Mission Statement  \nWithin a vibrant and supportive learning environment, the University of Alberta discovers, \ndisseminates, and applies new knowledge for the benefit of society through teaching and learning, \nresearch and creative activity, community involvement, and partnerships.

For the Public Good was \ncommunity-developed, drawing on the experiences, perspectives, and leadership of our students, \nfaculty and staff, and on the many communities and institutions with which the university fosters \nproductive relationships. \nThe consultation process on For the Public Good was extensive, and included the following steps:  \n● The formation of an Institutional Strategic Plan Advisory Committee with broad \nrepresentation from across the university. \n● Pre-planning consultations with all faculty councils and with senior administration that \nresulted in the development of a discussion paper that supported institutional discussions \nabout our approach to the new plan. \n● The discussion paper supported the next round of consultations, including campus forums, \nroundtable meetings, meetings with student associations, meetings with faculty councils, \nconsultation with university committees, the Senate, the Alumni Council and the Board of \nGovernors, and the collection of online and email submissions. Based on these \nconsultations, a first draft was developed. \n● Consultation on the draft plan included a new round of campus forums, roundtables, \nmeetings with student associations, meetings with faculty councils, consultation with \nuniversity committees, the Senate, the Alumni Council and the Board of Governors.  \n● Regular updates to the university community, including summaries of the consultation, were \nprovided through the Institutional Strategic Plan website.  \n● In the end, more than 65 meetings with stakeholders and members of the university \ncommunity were held, engaging a combined total of more than 1,800 people. More than 125 \nonline and email responses were received. \n● A separate consultation process with administrative and governance committees took place \nin fall 2016 on institutional indicators for measuring our progress on For the Public Good. \nThese performance measures were approved in early 2017. \nThe goals and priority initiatives described in this CIP reflect the input received over many months of \nconsultation on the Institutional Strategic Plan in 2015-16. These goals and initiatives directly \nsupport Alberta’s Adult Learning System Principles: ensuring the accessibility of a wide range of \nprograms and experiences to Albertans and top students from Canada and the world; maintaining \nthe affordability of the U of A experience and the sustainability of our programming and \ninfrastructure; delivering research and teaching that has global quality, relevance, and impact; \npromoting coordination within and beyond our walls, with partners in education, community, \ngovernment, and industry; and embracing our accountability to government, to our community, and \nto a wide array of stakeholders within and beyond the academy. \nThe measures described in the CIP align with those developed as a part of the accountability \nprocess in For the Public Good, and will align with the university’s annual reporting process to the \nGovernment of Alberta. Where quantitative measures cannot be identified, a narrative update on \nprogress on the priority initiatives listed in the CIP will be provided in the Annual Report.  \nThe University of Alberta Comprehensive Institutional Plan is developed by a working group with \nrepresentation from all administrative units across the institution and is approved through a robust \ngovernance process.   \nCOMPREHENSIVE INSTITUTIONAL PLAN 2017-20                                                              11 \nC OMPR E HE N S I VE  I NS T I TU T ION A L  PL A N  -  DR A FT \nAs the university now turns its attention to the implementation of the goals and objectives articulated \nin For the Public Good, and reflected in the Comprehensive Institutional Plan, the university \ncontinues to consult with those stakeholders affected by specific strategies to ensure that the plan’s \nrealization continues to be a reflection of our diverse community. \nIn addition to the consultation process described above, the University of Alberta is in regular \ncommunication with the other Comprehensive Academic and Research Institutions (CARI) \ninstitutions, and other institutions in Alberta, to share information about our approach to the CIP. The \nuniversity has also been in regular contact with officials from the Ministry of Advanced Education to \nensure full understanding of the CIP Guidelines and to ensure that the CIP includes the information \nexpected from the ministry.  \nCOMPREHENSIVE INSTITUTIONAL PLAN 2017-20                                                              12 \nC OMPR E HE N S I VE  I NS T I TU T ION A L  PL A N  -  DR A FT \nGOALS, PRIORITY INITIATIVES, AND \nEXPECTED OUTCOMES  \nOverview \nFor the Public Good affirms our vision to inspire the human spirit through outstanding achievements \nin learning, discovery, and citizenship, motivated by the University of Alberta’s 109-year history of \nleadership and public service.  \nThe goals described in For the Public Good directly support Alberta’s Adult Learning System \nPrinciples, and position us to lead on the accessibility, affordability, quality, coordination, and \naccountability of the post-secondary and research system as whole. \nAlberta’s Adult Learning System Principles \nAccessibility \nThe University of Alberta is committed to accessibility for Albertans, Canadians, and citizens of the \nworld. As a Comprehensive Academic and Research Institution (CARI), the U of A plays a critical \nrole in Alberta’s post-secondary system by providing access to a full range of foundational programs, \nspecialized programs in the professions (e.g., Law, Medicine, and Engineering), and graduate \nprograms that support Alberta’s research and innovation needs across faculties. Our multi-campus \nenvironment provides access to diverse experiences, ranging from our downtown Enterprise Square \nto rurally-based Augustana to the francophone Campus Saint-Jean, unique in western Canada. \nThrough its breadth of offerings, the U of A provides students at all stages with access to a variety of \nacademic and career pathways, and our internationally renowned quality positions our graduates to \nmake an impact for the benefit of all Albertans. Accessibility is supported by almost $90 million in \nscholarship and bursary funding per year. \nOver the next three years, the U of A will prioritize increasing the diversity of the student body by \nreaching out to under-represented communities of learners—including Indigenous, rural, and \nfrancophone students—and diversifying our international student population without decreasing \naccess for Albertans. It is also critical to ensure that our academic and non-academic workforce \nbegins to reflect the makeup of the population we serve and benefits from a rich diversity of cultures, \nexperiences, and ideas. Accordingly, we aim to increase the proportion of women professors, \nIndigenous professors, visible minorities, Indigenous peoples, and persons with disabilities among \nour faculty, staff, and students by reviewing recruitment and hiring practices to eliminate barriers to \ndiversity and encourage under-represented groups, such as Indigenous young men. \nThe university is committed to responding to the Calls to Action of the Truth and Reconciliation \nCommission of Canada with concrete initiatives that contribute to closing the educational gap \nbetween Indigenous and non-Indigenous people and improving relationships with Indigenous \npeoples and communities. The development of the Maskwa House of Learning as a place for \nunderstanding and dialogue between Indigenous and non-Indigenous members of our community is \ncentral to this commitment.  \nOur accessibility goals are supported by a commitment to the health and wellness of our students, \nfaculty, and staff. The key to great programs is great people offering and participating in them. The \nCOMPREHENSIVE INSTITUTIONAL PLAN 2017-20                                                              13 \nC OMPR E HE N S I VE  I NS T I TU T ION A L  PL A N  -  DR A FT \nuniversity is launching an institution-wide Healthy University Strategy, and continues to improve \nservices for victims of sexual assault in response to a comprehensive review conducted in 2015.  \nAffordability \nIn addition to its robust systems for student financial aid, the university supports affordability by \nensuring the efficiency and sustainability of our programs, administrative systems, and \ninfrastructure. By ensuring efficient and optimal performance across all areas, we are able to \ncontinue to offer programs and educational experiences of international quality while preserving \naffordability and accessibility. Sustainability should ensure that programs, including specialty \nprograms, remain in reach of the students desiring them, and that cost drivers and market conditions \nare constantly monitored to ensure that programs are appropriately placed to attract and support \nparticipation across economic circumstances. \nThe specialty, professional, and research-intensive programs available at the University of Alberta \nenhance accessibility and affordability to Albertans who might otherwise have to travel further and \nlive in different economic climates to pursue careers in areas such as Law, Public Health, Business, \nEconomics, Medicine, Animal Science, and Engineering, to name a few. Note: initiatives related to \nstudent financial supports are included under Accessibility, as they directly support the university’s \ngoals in this area. \nOver the next three years, the university will particularly prioritize seeking secure funding to support \nstrategic goals, upgrading its IT infrastructure to increase the reliability of services to the university \ncommunity and to extend reach to partner institutions and isolated communities and to enhance \ncommunication clarity and effectiveness within the university and to its partners and stakeholder \ncommunities. On an ongoing basis, the university monitors the quality, relevance, and appeal of its \nprograms through regular program quality reviews and continual tracking of application pressure and \nprogram completion. \nQuality \nQuality is paramount for the University of Alberta. The university is committed to a minimum \nacceptable standard of quality in all its activities. The province must have world-class institutions of \nhigher learning to attract the best and brightest students, faculty, and staff who all equally participate \nas citizens. A high quality intellectual environment will continue to attract diverse and creative \nthinkers to the province, where they will invigorate established industries and develop economic and \nsocial diversity. Only with world-class faculty members and students in a secure, inviting, diverse, \nand innovative environment can world-class outcomes of teaching, learning, research, and \ninnovation be achieved.  \nAt the centre of our quality agenda is a process to identify and support signature areas of research \nand teaching excellence. These are areas of local, national, and global relevance in which the U of A \nis, or can become, a world leader with a critical mass of scholars and students. Identifying signature \nareas will enable us to focus resources strategically to maximize our impact and our success in \npursuing major funding opportunities. To ensure the long-term sustainability of our professoriate, we \nare also committed to developing a faculty renewal program, with an initial focus on increasing the \nproportion of Assistant Professors and supporting equity and diversity in the academy. The \nuniversity is driving quality and innovation in teaching through initiatives such as an enhanced focus \non experiential learning, ensuring that our graduates are exposed to a range of environments and \ndevelop world-ready skills outside the classroom. In the immediate future, we are developing an \ninventory of existing opportunities and online resources to make current and new opportunities and \nsupports more accessible to students.  \nCOMPREHENSIVE INSTITUTIONAL PLAN 2017-20                                                              14 \nC OMPR E HE N S I VE  I NS T I TU T ION A L  PL A N  -  DR A FT \nCoordination \nThe university’s approach to coordination is reflected in its ongoing partnerships with Campus \nAlberta institutions across the post-secondary system and its numerous and long-standing \ncollaborations with community organizations—for the public good. Our deep commitment to \nengagement, outreach, and partnership ensures that we make efficient use of our resources, \nmaximize the impact and relevance of our research, and deliver value for the communities we serve. \nAs a community of over 50,000 people, we also promote and embrace coordination across our five \ncampuses, 18 faculties, and multiple administrative units. \nOver the next three years, the U of A will continue to build capacity to connect with diverse \ncommunities across our campuses, including seeking funding and support for shared-use, \ncommunity-access infrastructure in downtown Edmonton and at South Campus. We are developing \nstrategies to ensure that we are taking full advantage of our multi-campus environment to offer \ndiverse experiences and engage local and regional stakeholders on an ongoing basis.  \nWe will continue to build relationships with Indigenous post-secondary providers in Alberta, to \nsupport rural and remote learners through IT supports, and work with Alberta Health Services to \nenhance health-related teaching, learning, and continuous education opportunities within both \norganizations.  \nAccountability \nAs an institution dedicated to the public good, the university is accountable to government and other \nfunders, as well as to the local community, our students and faculty, and to the global community of \nscholars and teachers. These accountabilities inform our commitments to the responsible \nstewardship of our resources and the transparent communication of our impact. Core priorities for \nthe 2017-20 period include revising our budget model, developing a suite of measures and tools for \nreporting on institutional performance, and continuing to build our advancement function to diversify \nour funding sources. We are also prioritizing the development of an institutional communications \nstrategy to better tell the university’s story and demonstrate its impact on communities locally, \nnationally, and abroad—this is critical to our accountability to community, and directly supports a \nbroad range of community engagement activities described above. Our commitment to \naccountability is also reflected in our active response to the Truth and Reconciliation Commission of \nCanada, as outlined in our Accessibility initiatives. \nFinancial and Budget Information \nTo support all these activities, the university must respond to existing budget pressures and \ncommitments, and manage its budget and finances frugally. For any uncommitted funds, we have \nprioritized renewing the professoriate, which entails making career-long commitments to the best \nand brightest faculty and staff who will be role models of diversity and will contribute to our research \nand scholarly missions. The budget remains subject to systemic risks that are largely outside the \ncontrol of the university, most notably the Campus Alberta Grant—the university’s largest source of \nunrestricted revenue—and revenue from tuition and fees.  \nEnrolment and Programming \nThe university is rolling out new national and international recruitment plans to ensure that we \nremain competitive for top students without compromising access for Albertans. Overall, program \nenrolment is expected to be stable over the next three years, with some small shifts between \nprograms within faculties. Several faculties have the capacity to enrol beyond current targets if \nfunded. In contrast, numerous other programs experience significant application pressure they \nCOMPREHENSIVE INSTITUTIONAL PLAN 2017-20                                                              15 \nC OMPR E HE N S I VE  I NS T I TU T ION A L  PL A N  -  DR A FT \ncannot accommodate within their current funding envelopes—these include Computer Science, \nKinesiology, Augustana B.Sc. programs, the Collaborative Nursing program, all programs in \nPharmacy (being one of only two PharmD programs in Canada), the BCom in Accounting and \nFinance and the MBA in Business, all Engineering, the Education collaborative program with Red \nDeer College, and the Aboriginal Teacher Education Program. With additional dedicated funding, \ncapacity in these programs could be increased to address unmet demand from qualified applicants.  \nResearch \nA unique feature of the CARI sector is the mandate to produce cutting-edge knowledge, \ntechnologies, and products through the research enterprise. Across a range of partnerships and \ninitiatives, the university is a major driver of Alberta’s research outcomes: a strong economy and \neffective resource management; environmental stewardship; and supporting the health of Albertans \nin all of our communities.  \nThe university is also mindful of the need to meet the Grand Challenges facing our world, and we \nwill continue to enthusiastically pursue all funding options to support world-class research and \nscholarship, including partnerships with industries, organizations, and communities to facilitate \nknowledge translation. \nCommunity outreach and underrepresented learners \nCommunity engagement is a core priority of For the Public Good. The university boasts many strong \npartnerships with community, such as the Saville Community Sports Centre on South Campus. \nProjects across the academic, research, and capital plans are heavily-focused on strengthening \nengagements with community stakeholders. Prominent examples are the South Campus Community \nArenas project, the Maskwa House of Learning, and Future Energy Systems, which will bring \ntogether researchers across scientific disciplines to examine energy and other resource use. A \nspecific plan has been developed to recruit and retain Indigenous students, thus we expect to see \nincreased participation and increased rates of degree completion and overall satisfaction with their \nuniversity experience. \nInternationalization \nThe province benefits from graduates who are aware of the world-wide best practices and \napproaches to performance, professions, technology, social and environmental management. \nStudents benefit from understanding different perspectives and the vibrancy created by diversity in \ntheir social and work groups. The university will increase its relevance to the world by its continuous \npresence on the global stage in all its activities.  \nAn International Diversity Plan has been developed for international student recruitment. \nInternationalization is created by ensuring diversity among students (maintaining a 15 per cent \noverall proportion) and offering excellent learning opportunities to international students that they \ncannot access elsewhere. These efforts reap dividends for the province with more than 80 per cent \nof international students staying in Alberta, contributing to our economy and society. \nInternationalization also entails ensuring that the professoriate includes diverse, global viewpoints, \nthat University of Alberta people visit others around the world, and that visitors come to us from far \nand wide to share and germinate ideas.  \nCapital Plan \nWe must continue to ensure infrastructure of a level and quality commensurate with our current \nglobal position and ambitious goals. Our Capital Plan emphasizes renewal and repurposing, \nCOMPREHENSIVE INSTITUTIONAL PLAN 2017-20                                                              16 \nC OMPR E HE N S I VE  I NS T I TU T ION A L  PL A N  -  DR A FT \nensuring that previous investments are respected and preventing expensive and unnecessary new \nbuilds. Renewal and repurposing keeps pace with the changing world and needs of our students, \nfaculty, and staff, while increasing sustainability and reducing our carbon footprint. Our highest \npriorities are campus-specific.  \nAt Augustana and Campus Saint-Jean, science labs and classrooms need to be renewed to ensure \nthat all students and instructors have access to the high quality facilities and learning spaces. At \nNorth Campus, the biggest campus, the top priority is the Maskwa House of Learning. Second is the \nrenewal of several key buildings including the historically significant Dentistry/Pharmacy Building. \nFinally, various upgrades are necessary to support new teaching and learning technologies not \nimagined 50 to 100 years ago when these buildings were constructed. At South Campus, a \ncontinued focus on multi-use facilities that serve the university and engage the surrounding \ncommunities are priorities, including a High Performance Training and Research Centre that will \nbring together the best athletes and the best scientists, and the South Campus Community Arenas \nproject that will contribute to the general facilities context of the province.  \nInformation Technology \nFrom an infrastructure standpoint, it is abundantly clear that Information Technology is the backbone \nof communications and knowledge translation effectiveness and capacity. In order to stay \ncompetitive and serve our mandate, the university needs to keep pace with a lightning-fast \ntechnological world, use those technologies to their maximum potential, and to constantly educate \nourselves and the university stakeholder communities about engaging with those technologies, and \nlearning and engaging with cyber security measures in this fast-paced domain. \nKey outcomes \nThe University of Alberta’s new strategic plan speaks to our commitment to ensuring that everything \nwe do—in teaching, research, outreach, and administration—offers value to the communities we \nserve.  \nThe University of Alberta will deliver key outcomes that help realize that commitment. It will deliver a \nrenewed faculty that positions us to strengthen world-class teaching excellence; drive research and \ninnovation for Alberta; ensure an academy that is more diverse and inclusive, and with a healthier \nbalance of junior and senior rank academics. It will deliver a more diverse student body that reflects \nour commitment to accessibility and inclusiveness, with a higher proportion of Indigenous students \nand a more varied international student body. It will deliver a visible commitment to reconciliation, \nreflected in student and faculty recruitment, campus services, course and program offerings, and our \ncampus environments.  \nBy the end of this CIP time frame, we will have clearly defined signature areas of research and \nteaching excellence—areas in which we make world-class contributions for the benefit of Alberta, \nCanada, and the world. We will offer expanded access to experiential learning for our students, and \ndeeper connections with community and post-secondary partners, including Indigenous post-\nsecondaries. We will be accountable stewards, reflected in our internal budget model as well as our \nstrategies for communicating our value and impact to Albertans—including through a new U of A-\nlinked news site. \nThrough the goals and initiatives outlined below, the U of A will remain the province’s leading \neducator, generator of new ideas, and a leading engine of social, cultural, and economic \nprosperity—for the public good.  \nCOMPREHENSIVE INSTITUTIONAL PLAN 2017-20                                                              17 \nC OMPR E HE N S I VE  I NS T I TU T ION A L  PL A N  -  DR A FT \nGoals, priority initiatives, and expected outcomes \nACCESSIBILITY \nType Description  Expected \nCompletion \nDate \nFor the Public \nGood alignment \nGoals  \nG1 Prioritize and sustain student, faculty, and staff health, wellness, and safety by \ndelivering proactive, relevant, responsive and accessible services and initiatives. \n2018 Sustain Obj 19 \nG2 Develop, in consultation and collaboration with internal and external community \nstakeholders, a thoughtful, respectful, meaningful, and sustainable response to the \nreport of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada. \nOngoing Build Obj 4 \nG3 Build a diverse, inclusive community of exceptional undergraduate and graduate \nstudents from Edmonton, Alberta, Canada, and the world. \n2025 Build Obj 1 \nG4 Support the recruitment and retention of a diverse and inclusive faculty and non-\nacademic staff to ensure that students have access to a university community \nreflective of Alberta’s diversity.  \n2025 Build Obj 2, 3 \nPriority Initiatives  \nP1 Develop an integrated, institution-wide health and wellness strategy, which increases \nthe reach and effectiveness of existing health, mental health and wellness resources, \nprograms, and services, and promotes resilience and work-life balance.  \n2017 Sustain Obj 19 Str i \nP2 Continue the implementation of top recommendations of the 2016 Review of the \nUniversity of Alberta’s Response to Sexual Assault. \n2018 N/A \nP3 Increase the opportunities for all undergraduate and graduate students to experience \nthe benefits of living on campus, including guaranteeing the offer of a place in \nresidence to every first-year undergraduate student. \n2018 Experience Obj 8 Str i \nP4 Build the Maskwa House of Learning as a place of understanding, welcome, and \ncultural connection, where Indigenous and non-Indigenous students together can grow \nand celebrate the unique and proud histories of Indigenous peoples and where \nIndigenous students can access the social, cultural, and spiritual supports that enable \ntheir academic success.

Through the implementation of its \nstrategic plan, the university is contributing to the achievement of the ministry’s priorities of \naccessibility, affordability, quality, coordination and accountability. As a major economic driver in \nthe province, with government’s commitment of stable and predictable funding, the university will \nplay a critical role in buffering the Alberta economy from other sectors currently facing \nchallenges. \nThe U of A’s 2017-18 consolidated budget (see Table 1) reflects the entire enterprise, including \nunrestricted and restricted funds. Funding for general operations is fully unrestricted within the \nconsolidated budget. Funding for ancillary operations remains within those entities while the \nmajority of research revenues, philanthropic sources of revenue, and capital project funding are \nfully restricted. In an effort to provide full transparency of the university’s budgets, Table 2, on \npage 11, provides a breakdown of the consolidated budget by fund. \nFor 2016-17, the university is forecasting, at year-end, a consolidated excess of revenue over \nexpense of $35 million: a variance of $2.6 million below budget. Consolidated revenue is \nestimated to be $20.2 million lower than budgeted, while consolidated expense is estimated to \nbe $17.6 million lower than budgeted. The majority of the excess funds are restricted and \ntherefore can only be used for the purpose for which they have been granted. \nFor 2017-18, the consolidated budget reflects an excess of revenue over expense of $16.4 \nmillion on budgeted revenue of $1,919.1 million and budgeted expense of $1,902.7 million. The \n$16.4 million excess of revenue over expense is equal to less than one per cent of the \nuniversity’s budgeted consolidated revenue and is driven almost exclusively by excess of \nrevenue over expense within the restricted funds. For example, endowment funds and the \ncapitalized interest applicable to the endowment funds must remain intact in perpetuity and are \nunavailable for general operational spending. \nThe Statement of Operations and Expense by Function (consolidated budget) prepared under \nthe Public Sector Accounting Standards and the Statement of Cash Flows are presented in \nTables 5 and 6 found on pages 17 and 18. \nConsolidated revenue \nBudgeted revenue for 2017-18 is $1,919.1 million. As illustrated in Figure 1, 51.1 per cent or \n$980.9 million comes from the Government of Alberta, mostly through the Campus Alberta \nGrant, sponsored research funding, and capital funding. Of the $980.9 million, $628 million \nrepresents the Campus Alberta Grant, the primary source of unrestricted funding for the \nC OMPR E HE N S I VE  I NS T I TU T ION A L  PL A N  -  DR A FT \n28 \nD\nR\nA\nF\nuniversity’s day-to-day operating activity and as reflected in the operating fund (see Table 2). \nThe 2017-18 budget has been prepared based on an assumption of a two per cent increase to \nthe Campus Alberta Grant or the equivalent of $12.3 million.  \nGiven the current fiscal challenges facing the province, forecasting a two per cent increase to \nthe Campus Alberta Grant is not without its risks. Given government’s tremendous commitment \nto support higher education and the university’s importance to diversifying the provincial \neconomy, the university has factored in this increase. However, the university has also \ndeveloped budget scenarios with no change to the grant and a two per cent decrease to the \ngrant.  \nThe federal and other government revenue of $216.8 million largely reflects the funding received \nby the university in support of its research mandate, and is its third largest source of revenue. \nThis revenue is budgeted to be $33.2 million higher than the 2016-17 budget. This increase in \nresearch funding is driven primarily by the federal government’s investment in higher education \nthrough the Post-secondary Strategic Initiatives Fund (SIF) program. The balance of the \nbudgeted research funding is directly linked to the university’s overall success in securing Tri-\nCouncil research grants and grants from other organizations and entities.  \nTuition and related fees are budgeted at $329.9 million and, at 17.2 per cent, represent the \nsecond-largest source of consolidated revenue and is budgeted to be slightly higher than 2016-\n2017 budgeted revenue. Tuition and related fees include all instructional fees, market modifiers, \nprogram fee differentials, international differential fees and non-instructional fees. In October \n2016, the provincial government announced a continuation of the tuition freeze to 2017-18 for \nregulated tuition fees and Mandatory Non-Instructional Fees (MNIFs). This budget has been \nprepared assuming no backfill funding to offset the tuition freeze. In December 2016, the Board \nof Governors approved a 3.02 per cent increase to international student tuition fees as well as \nan additional increase of $4,000 to all full-time graduate programs not including cost recovery \nprograms and not including graduate based Physical Therapy, Occupational Therapy, and \nSpeech Therapy programs. This $4,000 increase will be offset by an equal amount of financial \nsupport provided to international graduate students. The Board also approved an increase in \ninternational differential fees in the Integrated Petroleum Geosciences program.  \nThrough extensive consultation with students, the university developed an agreed to Academic \nPrice Index (API). The API is a prospective calculation used in determining the increasing costs \nof the university’s operations. The API is a weighted calculation based on the major operating \nfund expenditure categories of salaries, benefits, supplies, utilities and maintenance. The \nuniversity’s API for 2017-18 was calculated at 3.02 per cent. Originally developed with students \nto determine the annual increases in MNIFs, this formula has been further applied to set \ninternational tuition increases. Unlike the Alberta Consumer Price Index (CPI), the API basket of \nservices is tied directly to the university’s primary cost drivers. The university believes that the \ndevelopment of a province-wide API could be of value as government undertakes its current \nreview of the post-secondary sector funding model and tuition fee regulation. The university has \nused the API calculation methodology to forecast future international tuition fee increases. \nHowever, as always, the university continues to closely monitor overall program costs, market \ndemand and tuition levels for international students at competing institutions to determine \nwhether additional adjustments in international tuition should be made.  \nThe fourth-largest source of revenue is sales of services and products at $206.1 million. The \nmajority of sales of services and products are generated through the university’s ancillary \noperations such as parking and the university’s housing and food service operations. Increased \nrevenue through ancillary operations is driven by forecast growth such as increased residence \ncapacity as well as rate increases for residence services and parking as approved by the Board \nC OMPR E HE N S I VE  I NS T I TU T ION A L  PL A N  -  DR A FT \n29 \nD\nR\nA\nF\nin December, 2016. However, the demand for residence spaces is starting to soften in response \nto rental market conditions, which could impact revenues from ancillary operations. \nThe other sources of consolidated revenue for 2017-18 include grants and donations of $117 \nmillion and investment income of $68.2 million. Changes in donations are directly tied to the \nuniversity’s philanthropic activities and can be influenced significantly by large single donations \nand economic conditions. It is important to note that the majority of donations are restricted and \ncan only be used for the purposes designated. Investment income is driven by the overall value \nof the university’s restricted endowments, its short-term investments as well as changes in \ninterest rates and the performance of the university’s investment portfolios. \nFigure 1. Consolidated Revenue Budget 2017-18 by source  \nConsolidated expense \nFor 2017-18, consolidated expense is budgeted at $1,902.7 million.  \nAs Figure 2 illustrates, investments in salaries and benefits to maintain teaching, research, and \nother critical activities account for over $1.1 billion or 60.0 per cent of total expense. This \nexpense factors in negotiated collective agreement salary increases to faculty and staff. In \naddition, the university must also budget for the regulated and inflationary increases to statutory \nand non-statutory benefits such as supplementary health plans. Adjustments for increased \npension plan contributions in response to unfunded pension plan liabilities have also been \nfactored in.  \nThe university’s next largest expense is materials, supplies, and services. Budgeted at $311.3 \nmillion, these expenses provide essential support across the campuses, including Information \nServices and Technology, research expenditures, library resources, and central expenditures \nsuch as insurance premiums. This expense line also includes the costs of goods sold and \nrecovered, largely within ancillary operations. In budgeting for these expense items, the \nuniversity continues to face the challenge whereby inflation within higher education as reflected \nby the Academic Price Index (API), significantly exceeds general inflationary increases as \nC OMPR E HE N S I VE  I NS T I TU T ION A L  PL A N  -  DR A FT \n30 \nD\nR\nA\nF\nrepresented by the Alberta Consumer Price Index (CPI). Reasons why the API is higher than the \nCPI include library collections, which are not only impacted by general inflationary increases but \nalso the value of the Canadian dollar relative to the US dollar, in which most library purchases \nare made. For 2017-18 the library estimates serial and monograph inflation of between 2.5 and \n6.0 per cent (on a $25 million collections budget) and an additional currency impact of $1.7 \nmillion. Information Technology is forecasting inflation increases of 6.2 per cent on contracts and \nFacilities and Operations is forecasting average inflation increases of 5.0 per cent including the \nimpact of the increased minimum wage. The university has estimated that for the 15-month \nperiod of January 1, 2017 to March 31, 2018, the carbon levy will increase the university’s utility \ncosts by a minimum of $2.5 million. When fully implemented the carbon levy will increase the \nuniversity’s utility costs by an estimated $6 million or the equivalent of a one per cent grant \nadjustment to the university’s 2017-18 Campus Alberta Grant.  \nA further significant expense in the consolidated budget is $178.5 million for the amortization of \ncapital assets. Amortization is an annual expense that is calculated based on the estimated \nuseful life of the asset. These assets include buildings, scientific and computing equipment, \nsoftware, and learning resources. \nFor 2017-18, scholarships and bursaries expenses are budgeted at $89.2 million. This \nrepresents a $2.1 million, or 2.4 per cent increase, over the 2016-17 budget and the university’s \ncontinuing commitment to invest in its students—particularly those who require financial \nassistance to attend the university. \nC OMPR E HE N S I VE  I NS T I TU T ION A L  PL A N  -  DR A FT \n31 \nD\nR\nA\nF\nFigure 2. Consolidated Expense Budget 2017-18 by type \nOperating fund investment priorities \nThe operating fund (see Table 2) is used to support the primary teaching and learning activities \nof the university. It is also within the operating fund that strategic investments are made to \nadvance For the Public Good and its five strategic goals of: Build, Experience, Excel, Engage \nand Sustain. \nThe operating fund is prepared under Public Sector Accounting Standards and must reflect \nlosses that are incurred or recoveries that are made including re-evaluations as a result of \nchanges in market conditions. The $9.3 million operating excess that is shown in the operating \nfund is the result of re-measurement of the university's unfunded benefits liability, which is driven \nprimarily by pension plans. The improving financial markets contributed to this $9.3 million re-\nevaluation gain. There remains a significant unfunded liability within the pension plans, therefore \nthe $9.3 million does not reflect cash on hand and cannot be used to invest in new expenditures \nor offset any increases in existing expenditures. \nThe consolidated budget has been prepared based on two fundamental assumptions. One, the \nuniversity will receive a two per cent increase to the Campus Alberta Grant or approximately \n$12.3 million in the operating fund. Secondly, that faculties and units will continue to be \nresponsible for funding their portion of collective agreement increases which represents \napproximately $12.0 million. Many of the faculties and units will need to reduce other \nexpenditure lines, eliminate vacancies, lay off staff or draw down their positive carry forwards in \norder to fund the costs associated with their staff. The net result is that faculties and units will \nneed to re-allocate expenditure lines within their budgets to fund salaries. \nAlthough the provincial government has committed to investing in higher education and \nproviding predicable funding, given the government’s current fiscal situation, the two per cent \ngrant increase assumption has some risk. Within the operating fund, priority areas identified for \nsupport include sustaining ongoing commitments to faculty recruitment and retention, partial \nC OMPR E HE N S I VE  I NS T I TU T ION A L  PL A N  -  DR A FT \n32 \nD\nR\nA\nF\nfunding of inflationary pressures associated with the university’s library collections, and base \nfundraising support to sustain current operations and resulting donation levels. Final allocation \ndecisions will not be made until after the provincial budget is tabled and the ministry confirms the \nadjustment to the university’s Campus Alberta Grant. \nIn the event that the university gets less than a two per cent grant increase or its grant is \nreduced, the university will need to apply budget cuts across the institution in addition to the \nimpact of the faculties and units absorbing across the board (ATB) salary settlements and merit. \nBased on a scenario where there is no change to the grant, a budget cut up to 2.2 per cent \nwould be required. This would be in addition to the average impact of 1.7 per cent across the \noperating fund as the faculties and units absorb ATB and merit, for a combined impact up to 3.9 \nper cent. A two per cent cut to the Campus Alberta Grant would have a combined impact of up \nto a 5.5 per cent cut. Every one per cent cut to the operating fund is equal to $7.5 million which \nequates to 48 faculty positions, or 106 support positions or the elimination of over 1,000 class \nsections.  \nPublic sector institutions like the University of Alberta play a critical role in the economy from \nmany different perspectives. First, the university attracts hundreds of millions of dollars from \noutside Alberta largely for research, creating high paying professional employment opportunities \nand subsequent spin-off benefits to the Alberta economy. Secondly, the university attracts \nthousands of students from around the world, further bolstering the economy. As a world-leading \nresearch institution, the university supports diversification of the economy. Finally, it is educating \ntens of thousands of students who will create further economic benefits and assist in economic \ndiversification. For these reasons and others, providing the necessary increases to the Campus \nAlberta Grant is a sound investment as the University of Alberta functions as a critical buffer to \nthe economy while other industries and sectors continue to adjust to the current economic \nenvironment.  \nConsolidated budget highlights and sensitivities \nThe university prepares its fiscal estimates and final budgets using a comprehensive integrated \nplanning and budget process, involving key stakeholders from across the institution. Key budget \nassumptions and sensitivities are cornerstones of the university’s multi-year budgeting process. \nThe goal is to achieve improved accuracy in forecasting elements of the budget and provide \ncommon assumptions for budget planners across the university. \n2017-18 budget highlights \nKey revenue highlights include: \n● A two per cent increase to the Campus Alberta Grant.  \n● Maintaining general tuition increases and MNIF at 2014-15 levels (due to government \ntuition freeze) while increasing international student tuition fees by 3.02 per cent for \n2017-18. \n● A $4,000 per full-time student increase to international graduate tuition offset by $4,000 \nin financial support (with some program exclusions). \n● Tuition increase to the Integrated Petroleum Geosciences graduate program. \n● Continuation of a low interest rate environment with endowment returns budgeted at 6.97 \nper cent. \n● Modest growth in research funding. \n● Modest growth in investment income. \n● Slight decline in capital funding. \nKey expenditure highlights include: \nC OMPR E HE N S I VE  I NS T I TU T ION A L  PL A N  -  DR A FT \n33 \nD\nR\nA\nF\n● Academic staff negotiated ATB salary increase of 1.50 per cent, with an average merit of \n1.10 per cent. \n● Support staff negotiated ATB salary increase of 0 per cent, with an average merit of 1.04 \nper cent (Note: Support staff ATB salary adjustment to be negotiated if government \nunions negotiate an increase). \n● Benefit cost increases of 3.1 per cent (excluding Fund 290). \n● All faculties and administrative units absorb negotiated salary ATB and merit. \n● General inflation on contractual obligations of 4.0 per cent. \n● Impact of carbon levy of $2.2 million ($6 million impact when fully rolled in year three). \n● Impact of minimum wage increase in contractual obligations of $1.0 million. \n2017-18 budget sensitivities \nRevenue Approximate Value \n● One per cent on Campus Alberta Grant: $6.2 million. \n● One per cent on credit tuition: $2.7 million. \n● A 0.25 per cent on short-term interest rate: $1.5 million. \nExpense Approximate Value \n● One per cent change in salary settlements (ASSUA and NASA): $6.3 million. \n● One per cent increase in benefits: approximately $1.8 million. \n● A $1/gigajoule increase in natural gas: $2.7 million. \n● One per cent operating budget reduction: $7.5 million. \nForecast budget assumptions 2018-19 to 2020-21 \nThe university has used the following forecast budget assumptions. \nRevenue assumptions: \n● The grant will increase at two per cent per year for each of 2018-19 to 2020-21. [Note: \nthe review of post-secondary funding is currently underway by government]. \n● Regulated tuition will increase by the Alberta Consumer Price Index and all other fees \nwill increases by a minimum of the Academic Price Index (approximately 3.3 per cent per \nyear). [Note: The review of the tuition fee regulation is currently underway by \ngovernment]. \n● All mandatory non-instructional fees will increase by the Academic Price Index \n(approximately 3.3 per cent). \n● Modest growth in research funding. \n● Interest income will remain at historically low levels with some modest recovery with \nendowment returns ranging from 7.0 to 7.25 per cent. \n● Stable capital funding. \nExpenditure assumptions: \n● ATB salary adjustments and merit and benefit costs will be subject to collective \nagreement negotiations (AASUA agreement expires June, 2018 and NASA agreement \nexpires March, 2019).  \n● Benefit cost increases forecast at 6.1 per cent per year predominantly related to pension \ncontributions. \n● All faculties and administrative units will continue to have responsibility for the funding of \nsalary ATB adjustments and merit. \n● All other expenditures are forecast to increase in the range of two to ten per cent. \nC OMPR E HE N S I VE  I NS T I TU T ION A L  PL A N  -  DR A FT \n34 \nD\nR\nA\nF\nTable 1. 2017-18 Consolidated Budget and Projections ($,000) \nC OMPR E HE N S I VE  I NS T I TU T ION A L  PL A N  -  DR A FT \n35 \nD\nR\nA\nF\nTable 2. 2017-18 Consolidated Budget By Fund ($,000)  \nInstitutional budget risks  \nThe current environment in which the university’s 2017-18 budget was prepared is \nunprecedented in terms of the major government policy reviews underway including the post-\nsecondary funding and tuition regulation reviews, the uncertainty around various revenue \ngeneration initiatives currently before government and the provincial government’s fiscal \nsituation. As a result, the university has identified many of its revenue and expenditure drivers at \na high risk level. The degree of uncertainty associated with core elements of the university’s \nbudget would indicate that a high level of caution should be exercised regarding current and \nlonger term budget assumptions.  \nSpecific factors affecting the university’s budget risks have been grouped in terms of systemic \nas well as specific revenue and expenditure risks for 2017-18. Systemic risks are those largely \noutside the control of the university. \nC OMPR E HE N S I VE  I NS T I TU T ION A L  PL A N  -  DR A FT \n36 \nD\nR\nA\nF\nSystemic Risks \nRevenue \n● Campus Alberta Grant. The grant continues to be the university's primary source of \nunrestricted revenue. The provincial government’s current fiscal situation, along with the \nongoing funding review, place any increase to the grant and the longer-term value of the \ngrant at a high risk.  \n● Tuition revenue. Tuition revenue is a factor of quantity, mix and price. The university \nrequires the ability to adjust enrolment numbers and mix to align with demand as well as \nadjust tuition levels in response to cost increases as well as market demand and \nconditions. This is particularly true regarding graduate and international student tuition \nfee levels. As well, if there are constraints on the Campus Alberta Grant, the university \nmust have the flexibility to generate tuition revenue to fulfill its academic mission and \nsustain the quality of the learning experience. As the tuition regulation is currently under \nreview by government, this revenue source may be at a high risk. \n● Student enrolment quantity and mix. Total tuition revenue is driven by tuition levels \nand a complex mix of student type and degree program. A broad range of external \nenvironmental or geopolitical issues can impact the university’s quantity and mix of \nstudents.  \n● Interest Rates. Interest income is an important source of revenue on the margin. With a \ncontinuation of low oil prices and the sluggish Canadian economy, there continues to be \ndownward pressure on the Bank of Canada rate. Low interest rates continue to impact \nthe ability of university to grow, on the margin, unrestricted revenue. \n● Alternative Revenue. The university must increase its capacity to generate alternative \nsources of revenue to offset constraints to grant funding, tuition revenue limitations, and \nlow investment income returns. However, the government has yet to approve the transfer \nof land to the land trust and several academic initiatives that could generate new sources \nof revenue. \n● Exchange Rates. The Canadian dollar continues to hover around $0.75 to the US dollar. \nAlthough a lower Canadian dollar benefits the provincial government in terms of oil and \ngas revenue, and reduces some international students’ cost of tuition, a declining \nCanadian dollar also increases the university's costs for many of the goods and services \nproduced in the US or purchased in US dollars. \nExpenditures \n● Compensation. The single largest expenditure for the university is employee \ncompensation. The greatest challenge faced by the university is the fact that total \ncompensation continues to increase at a faster rate than the university’s Campus Alberta \nGrant and tuition, its primary sources of operating funding.  \n● Unfunded Pension Plan Liabilities. The university is carrying a large unfunded liability \nin its pension plans. The high contribution rates and the overall level of the unfunded \nliability present significant risk to the university. \n● Academic Price Index The costs within the university (Academic Price Index) are rising \nat a faster rate than general inflation (Consumer Price Index) and the overall rate of \nincrease in the university’s operating revenues. The university’s API is also being \nnegatively impacted by the carbon levy as well as the increases to minimum wage. The \nC OMPR E HE N S I VE  I NS T I TU T ION A L  PL A N  -  DR A FT \n37 \nD\nR\nA\nF\noverall rate of increase in the API continues to put significant pressure on ability of the \nuniversity to balance its operating fund. \n● Deferred Maintenance. As the largest and oldest post-secondary institution in the \nprovince, the university’s deferred maintenance continues to increase, reaching $938 \nmillion. This level of deferred maintenance could result in a significant building system \nfailure, negatively impacting the university’s operations.  \n2017-18 Budget Risks \n● Campus Alberta Grant: High. Given the current fiscal position of the provincial \ngovernment receiving a two per cent increase the grant is considered high risk. \n● NASA Collective Agreement: Medium. The NASA collective agreement is subject to a \nwage re-opener if the Alberta government and its employees negotiate a general wage \nincrease. This could result in an increase to the university’s salary expenditures. \n● Impact of ATB and Merit: Medium to High. Each faculty and unit is responsible to fund \ntheir cost of ATB and merit. Each unit has a different capacity to meet these \ncommitments. Depending on the unit, this may require a re-alignment of budgets \nincluding position eliminations and staff layoffs.  \n● Salary equity Issues: Medium. The university is continuing its review of data to assess \nwhether salary equity issues are present within the academic workforce. If salary equity \nissues are identified they will need to be addressed by the university.  \nCapital and ancillary budgets \nCapital  \nThe university can only achieve its vision if it has access to well-maintained and financially \nsupported facilities. Through a focus on well-planned functional renewal and re-purposing of \nexisting fiscal assets, essential teaching and research capacity that meets the needs of \ntomorrow’s students, teachers and researchers, can be delivered. The university’s ability to \nmeet its own and the province’s post-secondary access objectives, focusing on energy and \ncarbon footprint reductions and supporting the move to renewal energy (supporting the Climate \nLeadership Plan), depends on increased and stable investment in deferred maintenance, and \nstrategic investment in the renewal, upgrading and repurposing of older facilities, minimizing the \nneed for new construction. \nTable 3 lists the approved capital projects for 2017-18. New and continuing capital construction \nis budgeted at $128.7 million of the $156.7 million in capital projects. The capital budget also \nincludes $28 million in capital program spending under the infrastructure maintenance and \nenergy management programs. Table 3 also identifies proposed capital projects which are \nsubject to available funding. Detailed information on the university’s Capital Plan can be found in \nAppendix F. \nC OMPR E HE N S I VE  I NS T I TU T ION A L  PL A N  -  DR A FT \n38 \nD\nR\nA\nF\nTable 3. 2017-18 Capital Budget ($,000) \nC OMPR E HE N S I VE  I NS T I TU T ION A L  PL A N  -  DR A FT \n39 \nD\nR\nA\nF\nAncillaries \nThe university runs several large ancillary operations: Ancillary Services (Residence Services, \nHospitality Services, Parking, Real Estate and Commercial Property Management Services, \nONEcard) the Bookstore, Enterprise Square, the University Health Centre, and Utilities.  \nAll of the university’s ancillaries must generate the required revenues to support their operating \nand ongoing capital requirements as well as maintain both operating and capital reserves. \nAncillary Services \nDespite short-term deficiencies in annual net operations, Ancillary Services maintains a \nsubstantial positive reserve balance. Significant challenges include: Michener Park housing \ncomplex deferred maintenance; increasing residence vacancy rate; increasing costs associated \nwith unionization; increasing minimum wage and the carbon levy; and residence and parking \nrates at, or near, market rates. These factors will need to be monitored carefully in terms of the \nlong-term impact on our financial position. \nBookstore \nThe bookstore continues to be challenged with e-delivery of course materials and increasing \ncompetition. With a strong focus on cost control, the bookstore is returning to a positive net \nposition. \nEnterprise Square \nEnterprise square remains in a positive financial position with all of its space fully occupied. \nUniversity Health Centre \nThe University Health Centre remains in a positive financial position. The area of greatest \nconcern is the continuation of targeted mental health funding from government to support the \nprovision of additional mental health support services. \nUtilities \nUtilities net operations remain in a balanced position while providing highly-dependable and \ncost-effective utilities to North Campus and surrounding entities. The greatest uncertainty is the \nlong-term impact of the government’s carbon levy policies and the need to upgrade its power \ngrid infrastructure to align with enhancements being implemented by EPCOR.  \nC OMPR E HE N S I VE  I NS T I TU T ION A L  PL A N  -  DR A FT \n40 \nD\nR\nA\nF\nTable 4. 2017-18 Ancillaries Budget and Projections ($,000)  \nC OMPR E HE N S I VE  I NS T I TU T ION A L  PL A N  -  DR A FT \n41 \nD\nR\nA\nF\nConclusion \nThe university faces significant budget uncertainty in 2017-18 however is determined to move \nforward with the implementation of its goals, objectives and strategies as outlined in For the \nPublic Good.

The U of A remains committed to attracting outstanding \nundergraduate and graduate students, post-doctoral fellows, and professors from Alberta, \nacross Canada, and abroad. Our academy represents and contributes to Canada’s and \nAlberta’s cultural diversity and is an inclusive community that values the perspectives of all \ngenders, Indigenous people, under-represented groups, and people from rural and northern \ncommunities. Along with an exceptional professoriate and highly-skilled technical and \nprofessional staff, these individuals create an integrated environment of teaching, learning, \nresearch, and creative activities. The U of A aims to provide enriched and transformative student \nexperiences, resulting in graduates who are engaged global citizens, prepared to contribute to \nthe social and economic wellbeing of the province, the nation, and the world. \nAccess to programs at the U of A evolves in response to student demand, workforce needs, and \nthe availability of resources. The University of Alberta values its relationships with other Campus \nAlberta institutions, and continues to engage in productive inter-institutional collaborations \nsupporting transfer and learner mobility.  \nPrograms listed in the table below are drawn from the Provider and Program Registry System \n(PaPRS). It is important to note that there is not perfect alignment between the programs listed \nin PaPRS and those listed in the University Calendar. There are a number of historical and \nsystems-related reasons for this incongruity, but university staff and staff from Advanced \nEducation are collaborating to create better alignment. \nGraduate Full Load Equivalent (FLE) numbers are artificially-inflated by the methodology for \ncalculating FLEs prescribed by PaPRS and the Learning Enrolment Reporting System (LERS). \nGraduate FLEs are calculated based on a fixed per-credit allocation which may not correspond \nto the actual credit load of a full-time U of A graduate student. For example, PaPRS assigns \nthesis-based graduate students a full load of 18 credits, while a full-time U of A graduate student \nregistered in a thesis-based program has a normal full load of 30 credits (1.7 FLE). Normal full \nloads for course-based programs at the U of A vary by program according to structure and \nrequirements. At the U of A, headcount is a more accurate reflection of graduate enrolment. \nUniversity of Alberta staff are engaged with Advanced Education about the challenges related to \nthese data.  \nWhile the table below provides enrolment figures and projections for all programs, as per the \ngovernment’s CIP guidelines, enrolment targets are provided at a faculty level. In most cases, \nthe university does not manage enrolment to a specific target or quota by program. Rather, \nenrolment is managed to an overall faculty-level target. This allows individual programs to \nrespond dynamically to changes in demand, supporting the growth and sustainability of \nemerging areas of study. This approach also allows students greater flexibility to change \nprograms within the same faculty as they refine their interests and educational goals. Finally, it \nallows faculties to manage the evolution of their programs, starting new ones and phasing out \nold ones without affecting overall enrolment numbers at the faculty level.  \nC OMPR E HE N S I VE  I NS T I TU T ION A L  PL A N  -  DR A FT \n44 \nD\nR\nA\nF\nInternational enrolment, reported here as per the CIP guidelines, varies widely across programs, \nespecially between undergraduate and graduate programs. Overall, the university’s proportion \nof international students (graduate and undergraduate) is approximately 17 per cent, with the \nproportion for the undergraduate student body at 14 per cent. International enrolment within \nindividual programs is driven by a variety of factors, including, in many cases, specific \narrangements with governments in foreign countries. Graduate programs tend to have a higher \nproportion of international enrolment than undergraduate programs. This is consistent with other \nmajor research universities, and reflects the university’s contribution to attracting outstanding \nfuture researchers, innovators, and professionals to Alberta. Graduate students pursue \nadvanced degrees based on where they can work with key scholars, or in internationally known \nprograms. A strong majority of international students will remain in Alberta post-graduation. \nAccording to the 2012 Graduate Outcomes Survey, 84 per cent of Alberta students who lived \noutside Canada at the time they applied to school remained in Alberta after graduation. At the U \nof A in particular, more than 70 per cent of international PhD students who entered the U of A \nbetween 2004 and 2006 had become Permanent Residents or citizens of Canada by the time \nthey graduated.  \nProposed programming changes \nQuality Degree Programs \nThe U of A offers foundational and relevant programs with the goal to educate every student as \nan engaged and informed citizen and lifelong learner. We provide a sophisticated layering of \ncredentials through programming designed to meet the needs of all learners seeking \nbaccalaureate credentials and higher, through to the highest professional and scientific \ndesignations.  \nAlongside traditional degree programs, there is growing interest in, and need for, combined \ndegrees, interdisciplinary programs, and cross-disciplinary embedded certificates. One of the \nfastest-growing credential types is the Course-Based Master’s degree, reflecting the need in \nindustries and communities for workers prepared with advanced degrees, Learning is a lifelong \nprocess, and the complexity of today’s economy means that learners return to the university for \nnew credentials throughout their careers. Diversity is captured in new programs and content and \nin approaches to studying problems and implementing solutions. New approaches to higher \neducation include regular evaluation of programs—allowing for refreshing and phasing out of \nprograms not sufficiently responsive to current educational, economic, and scientific needs \nalongside the development of new ones—and the development of traditional credentials (e.g., \nprofessional programs) to meet evolving learner needs.  \nThe university anticipates submitting the following new program proposals for approval during \nthe 2017-18 and 2018-19 years: \nCourse-based Master of Arts in the History of Art, \nDesign and Visual Culture (HADVC) \nPost-Baccalaureate Certificate (PBC) in \nIndigenous Business  \nCourse-based Master of Arts in Native Studies  University Certificate in Teaching Complex \nCommunication Needs Students \nCourse-based Master of Science in Genetic \nCounselling \nBachelor of Arts in Recreation Therapy \nCourse-based Master of Arts in Digital Humanities Bachelor of Arts in Modern Languages and \nCultural Studies \nC OMPR E HE N S I VE  I NS T I TU T ION A L  PL A N  -  DR A FT \n45 \nD\nR\nA\nF\nCourse-based Master of Arts in Policy Studies Certificate in Education à la Petite enfance (Child \nDevelopment Worker) \nPhD in Oral Medicine (Medical Sciences-Oral \nMedicine)  \nDiploma in Education à la Petite enfance (Child \nDevelopment Supervisor) \nPost-Baccalaureate Certificate (PBC) in \nCommunications and Technology \nCertificate in Préposé en soins de santé (Health \nCare Aide) \nPost-Baccalaureate Certificate (PBC) in \nAccounting \nDiploma in Techniques en Travail social et Santé \nmentale (Techniques in Social Work and Mental \nHealth) \nPost-Baccalaureate Certificate (PBC) in Health \nCare Leadership \nDiploma in Infimière auxilière (Licensed Practical \nNurse) \nPost-Baccalaureate Certificate (PBC) in \nEnvironmental Monitoring \nThe university anticipates submitting requests for the termination of: \n• Bachelor of Science in Actuarial Science \n• Bachelor of Science in Rangeland and Pasture Management \n• Bachelor of Education in Adult Education \n• Bachelor of Arts and Bachelor of Arts (Honors) in Italian Studies, Russian Language and \nLiterature, Ukrainian Folklore, Ukrainian Language and Literature, Middle Eastern and \nAfrican Studies \n• Bachelor of Music in Music History, School Music Route, and World Music Route  \n• Combined Bachelor of Arts in French and Italian, German and Scandinavian, Italian and \nSpanish, and Russian and Ukrainian.  \nThe university anticipates submitting requests for the suspension: \n• oCombined Bachelor of Science/Education in Education and Human Ecology \n• Bachelor of Arts in Latin American studies, Scandinavian Language and Literature, \nAncient and Medieval History, Comparative Literature, and Combined French and \nSpanish \n• Bachelor of Music in Composition and Theory \n• Bachelor of Design Computing Science Route and Printmaking Route.  \nThe university anticipates submitting requests for three program name changes: Bachelor of \nCommerce in Entrepreneurship and Family Enterprise; Bachelor of Science in Family Ecology; \nand, Master of Arts in Digital Humanities.  \nExperiential Learning \nExperiential learning enriches the quality of the academic experience. The University of Alberta \nhas prioritized increasing the opportunities for, and participation rates in, experiential learning for \nboth undergraduate and graduate students, through engagement with community, industry, \nprofessional organizations, and government locally, nationally, and internationally. The \nUniversity has a rich history of providing experiential learning opportunities that enhance the \nlearning experience and provide platforms through which our students will be better equipped to \nenter or re-enter the workforce post-graduation. In the near future, the university will conduct a \nsurvey to better understand the experiential learning needs of our students. Survey results will \nallow us to better communicate the full scope of the opportunities that exist already, and to \ndevelop new opportunities tailored to student needs.  \nC OMPR E HE N S I VE  I NS T I TU T ION A L  PL A N  -  DR A FT \n46 \nD\nR\nA\nF\nProfessional Education \nThe expansion of professional development opportunities for graduate students continues to be \na priority for the university. Robust professional development, including internships, events, \nworkshops and online resources, enhances their job market competitiveness. It also better \nprepares students to use their advanced degrees and other credentials beyond the academy. \nThis movement is critical for the future career paths of the students as well as for the \ndevelopment of the industries, organizations, and disciplines in which they will work. At the U of \nA, this priority is facilitated by a new requirement that each graduate student create a plan for \ntheir own development and undertake at least eight hours of professional development activity \nduring the course of their graduate degree. Professional development plans require students to \nresearch potential career paths, assess their own skillsets and fill any gaps, and establish a plan \nfor moving from graduate degree to career. \nENROLMENT TABLE APPENDED SEPARATELY  \nC OMPR E HE N S I VE  I NS T I TU T ION A L  PL A N  -  DR A FT \nAPPENDIX C \nRESEARCH, APPLIED RESEARCH, AND \nSCHOLARLY ACTIVITIES \nAs one of Canada’s top research-intensive institutions, the U of A leads the province in world-\nclass research outcomes and student experiences that drive innovation and enhance social, \ncultural, and economic development. The university offers research and doctoral programs \nacross seven thematic areas: humanities and fine arts, social structure and systems, science \nand technology, energy, environment, food and bio-resources, and health and wellness. This full \nspectrum of learning and inquiry positions the U of A’s academy and its graduates to make the \ncomprehensive contributions towards scientific, social, and cultural innovations needed to \nsupport Alberta’s post-secondary system principles and its identified provincial outcomes: \neffective resource and environmental management, a broadened economic base, and resilient \nand healthy individuals and communities. \nThe University of Alberta’s ground-breaking research focuses on redefining the social, cultural, \nenvironmental, and technological contexts that we will need in the future. Teacher education, for \nexample, must evolve to address new demands in schools where increased population diversity, \nas well as shifts in employment and industry, are influencing what and how we teach our \nchildren. Similar demographic changes are influencing the delivery of health care and health \ninformation. Increased use and fast-paced changes in communications technology are \ninfluencing how people access, consume, and critically examine information—all skills that \nuniversity graduates need. \nAt the forefront of training future researchers and innovators, the University of Alberta produces \nthe highest quality graduates, researchers, educators, highly-trained professionals and skilled \npersonnel for potential employers, ranging from social agencies, to schools, to other research-\nintensive universities, to industries, and to public and private corporations. Research must also \nbe recognized as an important career path in itself that supports the aspirations of individual \nAlbertans and the province as a whole. \nAccessibility \nAccessibility and diversity  \nAccessibility and diversity initiatives enable equitable access to positions of influence that shape \nand set research agendas and priorities, and to a full range of personal growth opportunities and \neventual employment paths. The U of A must bridge a critical gender gap in the professoriate, \nparticularly in the most senior ranks, and must strive to increase the representation of \nIndigenous scholars in the professoriate. The U of A must also strive to increase numbers of \nwomen and Indigenous people in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math) \ndisciplines. Despite long-term efforts to achieve gender balance in the academy, male faculty \nmembers continue to significantly outnumber female faculty. Indigenous people currently \ncomprise only one per cent of the professoriate. There is a dearth of Indigenous people with \nPhDs in Canada, and the university plays a key role in providing opportunities for Indigenous \npeople to reach this credential. Indigenous people achieve higher education at the rate of about \n12 per cent, only about half the rate among the general population (about 23 per cent). The U of \nC OMPR E HE N S I VE  I NS T I TU T ION A L  PL A N  -  DR A FT \n48 \nD\nR\nA\nF\nA, in partnership with other post-secondaries, must address this education gap at the \nundergraduate level by recruiting and offering appropriate supports to Indigenous students—one \nof the Calls to Action in the Truth and Reconciliation Commission report.  \nBalance of professors, post-doctoral fellows, graduate students and \nundergraduate students \nIn 2015-16, the U of A was home to over 36,000 students (almost 30,000 undergraduate and \nover 7,000 graduate). We are home to 2,071 full-time faculty members, approximately 600 post-\ndoctoral fellows, and 926 contract academic staff. Maintaining the right balance among \nprofessors, post-doctoral fellows, graduate, and undergraduate students is critical to the \nuniversity’s ability to offer access to a world-class education and an environment that nurtures \nand supports the full educational and career lifecycle of all U of A members. \nGraduate education and post-doctoral fellows \nOver 200 graduate programs, attended by over 7,000 graduate students and nearly 600 post-\ndoctoral trainees, are intricately entwined with the U of A’s learning, teaching, and discovery \nmandate. Individuals educated to the PhD level enable large-scale, visionary, and ambitious \nresearch agendas that have the potential for big impact results. They drive innovation and \nresearch within and beyond the university, including in industrial, community, and social \nsettings. They are key to shifting Alberta to a learning-based society that welcomes intellectual \nand economic diversity.  \nThe Faculty of Graduate Studies and Research Professional Development program advances \nresearch and develops professional skills and qualities sought by employers, making the U of \nA’s graduate students competitive in the global market for traditional educational positions (e.g., \nprofessors), industry positions (e.g., industrial research and development) and within \ncommunities (e.g., in the public service or non-profit sector).  \nThe post-doctoral complement is critical to Alberta’s research capacity and impact, yet receives \nno provincial support. Post-doctoral fellows are essential to our role as a global partner of choice \nfor international research consortia and training programs with top-tier collaborators. As highly \neducated and mobile researchers, post-doctoral fellows ensure the continuing vitality of the \nacademic community and increase the speed of sharing of knowledge and ideas. An expanded \nand diverse community of post-doctoral fellows will contribute to the U of A’s capacity to \ndiscover novel solutions to complex social, cultural, and economic challenges. Cohort targets \nwill be determined in response to the U of A strategic plan. \nQuality \nIn 2016, the U of A began to identify and support established and emerging areas of global \nresearch distinction and leadership by building a portfolio of signature areas that distinguish us \nfrom our peer institutions in Campus Alberta and beyond, and which exemplify the University of \nAlberta’s capacity to engage in big questions and global challenges. The first signature areas \nwill be announced in 2017. \nResearch initiatives at the U of A build on our prominent international collaborations to make \nsignificant contributions to areas of fundamental importance to Albertans (including energy and \nthe environment, health, and economic diversification), and to recruit and train the innovative \nleaders of tomorrow. We leverage provincial funding to attract greater external investment from \nthe public and private sector, including participation in prominent federal funding programs such \nas the Canada First Research Excellence Fund (CFREF), and to foster long-term cycles of \nsignificant re-investment in Alberta.  \nC OMPR E HE N S I VE  I NS T I TU T ION A L  PL A N  -  DR A FT \n49 \nD\nR\nA\nF\nOur strategic research priorities include projects focusing on environmental stewardship, \neffective resource management, supporting healthy Albertans in all of our communities, and a \nstrong economy. Selected strategic research projects include: \nA Strong Economy and Effective Resource Management \nFuture Energy Systems \nFuture Energy Systems brings together researchers across disciplines to improve energy \nsystems related to unconventional hydrocarbon resources—tailings ponds, greenhouse \nemissions, water use, land reclamation, and safe, efficient energy transportation. Future Energy \nSystems is multi-disciplinary and will examine energy demands, sources and processes through \na broad range of perspectives including social, economic, legal-scientific and technological. \nBuilding on the U of A’s strengths in advanced materials, smart electrical grids and \nbioprocessing, Future Energy Systems will help move Canada to a low-carbon energy economy. \nThe $75-million federal investment is part of the Canada First Research Excellence Fund to \nstrategically invest in areas where post-secondary research institutions have a competitive \nadvantage and can become global leaders. \nSCENEREI  \nTwo world-class research universities in energy and the environment, Tsinghua University in \nBeijing, China and the University of Alberta, have established a substantial collaborative \nresearch program—the Sino-Canadian Energy and Environment Research and Education \nInitiative (SCENEREI) – to address the world’s growing need for sustainable energy solutions \nthat offer reduced water use and minimized environmental impact. Stage 1 and Stage 2 of this \ncollaboration, totaling 34 research projects with more than $1.5 million in research investment, \ninclude: clean energy (hydrocarbon recovery, lignite upgrading, geoscience), energy policy \n(regulation, supply chains, socioeconomics), transportation (infrastructure), and the environment \n(water, monitoring, minimizing impact). \nThe partnership works on carbon capture and storage, geothermal energy, land reclamation and \nwater management, opening up new opportunities for technology transfer and collaboration with \nbusiness and industry. \nHelmholtz (HAI) \nHAI-E&E (Energy and Environment), a collaboration involving over 50 U of A researchers and \nfour Helmholtz research institutes in Germany, is involved in exploring cleaner energy \nproduction and solutions to pressing environmental issues facing Alberta’s oilsands and \nGermany’s coal production. \nEnvironmental Stewardship \nTracking Change, funded through SSHRC’s Partnership Grant, supports local and traditional \nknowledge research activities in the Mackenzie River basin and sister projects in the Lower \nAmazon and Lower Mekong River Basins. The project is led by the U of A alongside the \nTraditional Knowledge Steering Committee of the Mackenzie River Basin Board, the \nGovernment of Northwest Territories, and many other valued organizations. Its long-term goal is \nto strengthen the voices of subsistence fishers and Indigenous communities in the governance \nof major fresh-water ecosystems. \nSupporting Healthy Albertans in all of our Communities \nAddictions and mental health \nThe Addictions and Mental Health Research Lab in the School of Public Health is a collaborative \nand multi-disciplinary initiative that works closely with policy makers and health practitioners to \nmobilize knowledge. Current priorities include the Edmonton Drug Use and Health Survey, part \nC OMPR E HE N S I VE  I NS T I TU T ION A L  PL A N  -  DR A FT \n50 \nD\nR\nA\nF\nof a project funded by the Canadian Institutes of Health Research on evidence-based harm \nreduction policy. \nHealth and life sciences \nHelmholtz (HAI) partnerships strengthen health and life sciences research, such as infectious \ndisease, neuro-degenerative disease research and most recently diabetes research. An \nemerging partnership within HAI is the collaboration in diabetes research between the Alberta \nDiabetes Institute (ADI) and Helmholtz Zentrum Mϋnchen (HZM). Possible fields of joint \nstrategic research also identified include: metabolism and obesity, drug targets, gene and \nhormone therapy and cell therapies and Immunology. \nCoordination \nThe U of A embraces coordination with partners within and beyond Alberta to advance a \ndiversity of research priorities and agendas and to ensure the efficient and effective use of \nresources through collaborations that leverage our research strengths and those of partner \ninstitutions. In keeping with this approach, the U of A continues to build and support \ncollaborative research capacity to produce leading-edge research on critical issues that confront \nhumanity. Priority collaborations supporting Alberta’s social and economic outcomes are \nidentified above, and the university remains open to and encouraging of a wide range of \nresearch partnerships and collaborations.  \nThe university is committed to working with other partners in Alberta’s post-secondary sector to \nensure that Albertans have access to a range of programs to satisfy their post-secondary goals \nand employment needs. Graduate programs in particular are closely linked to the university’s \nresearch faculty and activities, and a robust and varied research enterprise directly supports the \navailability of a diversity of programming across the learning continuum.  \nThe U of A also remains committed to community-level collaboration, whether through the \ninvolvement of community partners in research or through ensuring that graduate students \ndevelop the skills to excel across all sectors of society. Initiatives to support collaboration in \nresearch are directly supportive of the university’s quality and accessibility objectives and are \ndescribed in Appendix D. \nC OMPR E HE N S I VE  I NS T I TU T ION A L  PL A N  -  DR A FT \n51 \nD\nR\nA\nF\nAPPENDIX D \nCOMMUNITY OUTREACH AND UNDER-\nREPRESENTED LEARNERS \nThe University of Alberta engages with a diverse set of stakeholder communities, defined by \ngeography, by cultural, linguistic, or ethnic affiliation, or by interest or practice. The U of A is \ncommitted to celebrating and supporting a diversity of cultures, languages, economies, and, \nespecially, ideas. The title of the new Institutional Strategic Plan, For the Public Good, reflects \nthis commitment. Engagement occurs in many forms and contexts: formally and informally; \ninternally and externally; locally, nationally, and globally. Community engagement is integral to \nthe U of A’s approach to achieving excellence and relevance in teaching and research, to \norganizational effectiveness, to infrastructure development, and to serving its diverse \nstakeholder communities. Much of the U of A’s engagement work is long-term in nature and \nreflects ongoing, mutually beneficial relationships between the university and the communities to \nwhich it is accountable. The sections below outline institutional priorities for 2017-19. Priorities \nand partnerships related to research and to capital planning are addressed in appendices C and \nF, respectively. \nAs part of its commitment to foster academic excellence through diversity, the U of A continues \nto prioritize recruiting and supporting under-represented and Indigenous learners. In concert, the \nuniversity is committed to actively responding to the Truth and Reconciliation Commission of \nCanada. \nCommunity Outreach and Engagement \nShowcasing the value and impact of the U of A, its scholars, and its alumni \nThe university prioritizes opportunities to connect researchers with communities and to enhance \nthe impact and profile of their work. For example, the Community-University Partnership for the \nStudy of Children, Youth, and Families brings together U of A researchers with community \nagencies from across Alberta. Through projects like the Centre for Public Involvement, a \npartnership between the U of A and City of Edmonton, the university participates in creating \n‘living laboratories’ to improve the practice of community engagement and outreach. And \nthrough programs like USchool, which partners with schools across Alberta to expose K-12 \nstudents to future possibilities in post-secondary education, the U of A builds bridges between \nits researchers and socially vulnerable communities. \nThe U of A connects its researchers to the general public through programs like the U of A \nSpeakers’ Bureau, partnered Speakers’ Series with the Edmonton Public Library, and many \nothers. The U of A also profiles its next generation of researchers through participation at the \nannual international Falling Walls Conference before a judging panel of academic, government, \nmedia and industry leaders. In addition, the university highlights exceptional efforts at \nengagement through its Community Connections Awards, which honour those whose work \nembodies the U of A’s promise of “uplifting the whole people” and has a positive impact on \ncommunities near and far. \nThe University of Alberta’s alumni showcase the positive impacts of its graduates on \ncommunities locally and abroad. The university will build on past successes as it expands \noutreach initiatives with graduates at all stages of their post-university life, with particular \nC OMPR E HE N S I VE  I NS T I TU T ION A L  PL A N  -  DR A FT \n52 \nD\nR\nA\nF\nemphasis on encouraging graduates from the last decade to re-engage with the university to \nhelp connect with their communities and participate in outreach and volunteer initiatives. Alumni \nengagement in 2017 will include conducting an alumni needs assessment to ensure that \nprograms, services, and benefits align with the interests of the alumni community. \nRecognizing that the university has a significant national profile, Canada’s sesquicentennial year \noffers an opportunity to raise awareness and pride around the university's distinctive and \npowerful contributions to Canadian history—to bring to light stories of achievement, \naccomplishment, and individual and shared histories that contribute to Canada's national fabric \nand its diverse sense of place and self. Engagement activities will be undertaken throughout the \nyear on the university's multiple campuses and through the digital space. \nInstitutional marketing and communications strategy \nFor 2017-18, the U of A has prioritized the development of a new institutional marketing and \ncommunications strategy that will include the building of a brand platform and launch of a news \nsite to tell the institution’s story in broader, more accessible ways. Working with internal \npartners, the marketing and communications strategy will use multiple delivery platforms to \nshowcase the U of A's economic, social, and other impacts, locally and globally. This strategy is \nintended to raise the U of A’s profile while increasing Albertans’ and Canadians’ awareness of \nthe value of the university. The news site, separate from, but unabashedly connected to the \nUniversity of Alberta, will carry a wide range of stories produced across the institution, and look \nand feel like a news website. Although completion of the marketing and communications \nstrategy is targeted for 2018-19, work to communicate the university's contributions is ongoing. \nSupporting community through campuses and infrastructure \nUniversity infrastructure across all campuses serves firstly to ensure adequate teaching, \nresearch, and experiential spaces for students, faculty, and staff, and secondly to provide \nshared spaces where citizens, scholars, research discoveries, sports, culture, language, and \nperforming arts can intersect. The U of A works continuously to maintain relationships with \nsurrounding communities and to develop new relationships with communities, near and far, of \nlearners, researchers, professionals as well as neighborhoods, municipalities, and countries. \nLocally, the institution will leverage its five campuses and infrastructure assets to establish \ngathering places that connect the university and communities. Rurally based Augustana \nCampus and bilingually focused Campus Saint-Jean boast unique opportunities to engage with \ndistinct communities. In 2017-18, the university will commence an amendment to the Long \nRange Development Plan for the Augustana Campus. The university places a high level of \nimportance on linguistic duality and multi-culturalism and will develop strategies that position the \ninstitution and Campus Saint-Jean as the leader in attracting local and international students \nwishing to further their post-secondary education in French. New infrastructure priorities for the \nnext three years include the proposed community arena complex on South Campus that, in \npartnership with the City of Edmonton, will provide enhanced sport infrastructure for the \nuniversity and city as a whole. Capital priorities are addressed in Appendix F. \nExperiential and community-engaged learning \nThrough a strengthened emphasis on experiential learning and professional development, the U \nof A also aims to enhance connections between students and their community (including \nemployers and not-for-profit organizations). At the undergraduate level, the university supports \nover 1,500 community service-learning (CSL) placements per year, working with nearly 200 \ncommunity organizations since 2003. Leveraging this success, the university will complement its \nstrong support for co-operative education and CSL with a focus on increasing the number and \naccessibility of experiential learning opportunities.  \nC OMPR E HE N S I VE  I NS T I TU T ION A L  PL A N  -  DR A FT \n53 \nD\nR\nA\nF\nAt the graduate level, the U of A’s emphasis on professional development is reflected in the \nmulti-year initiative of the Faculty of Graduate Studies and Research to place students in \nprofessional internships, providing mutually beneficial opportunities with community-based \norganizations and industry. The U of A is also engaged with global efforts to ‘redefine the PhD’ \nto ensure that industry benefits from more highly-prepared graduates and that PhD graduates \ncan consider robust non-academic career paths. These initiatives will not only enhance current \ncommunity relationships, but also better position our students to make an impact after \ngraduation.  \nUnder-represented and Indigenous learners \nThe U of A is pursuing a range of strategies to enhance the diversity of its student body and \nincrease participation among under-represented and Indigenous students. The active \nrecruitment of Indigenous students is complemented by student supports that aim to improve \nstudent success, and is supported by a broader institutional approach to Indigenization and \nreconciliation (outlined below).  \nThe U of A’s multi-campus environment, in particular Augustana and CSJ, plays a key role in \nsupporting access to the U of A among rural and francophone students. Augustana offers a \nleading liberal arts education in a smaller institutional setting, while the scope of CSJ’s French-\nlanguage programming is unique in western Canada. \nThrough a new national recruitment strategy, the institution is seeking to diversify the \nuniversity’s Canadian student body, while continuing to prioritize access for Albertans. Diversity \nenriches the academic environment and student experience, while ensuring that the university \nmore closely reflects the demographic composition of Alberta and Canada.  \nThe digital environment is an important component of the U of A’s efforts to expand access to \nlearning. The U of A continues to be a leader in the delivery of Massive Open Online Courses, \nor MOOCs, and to date, nearly a quarter of a million registrants have taken a MOOC at the \nUniversity of Alberta. With a wide variety of subject matter, classes are offered to the public for \ngeneral interest as well as for-credit for U of A students and students at other institutions. The \ncourses, which have included Dino 101, led by world-renowned paleontologist Dr. Phil Currie \nand Understanding Video Games and More, an area of emerging strength in Alberta, encourage \nlifelong learning, serve as a bridge to draw in non-traditional students and bring meaningful, \nuniversity-level content to participants. Two new MOOCs, Mountains 101 and Indigenous \nCanada, launched in 2017.  \nIndigenization and reconciliation \nThrough sharing, listening, and supporting as well as enhanced curriculum and programming for \nin-class or in the digital realm, the U of A will continue to take steps to value, recognize, and \nreconcile with Indigenous communities and traditional ways of knowing. Advancing the \nconstruction of the new Maskwa House of Learning, a gathering and academic space for the \nIndigenous students on North Campus, remains a high priority. The institution continues to \ndevelop strategies to increase enrolment of Indigenous students in all faculties, with the goal of \nenrolling Indigenous students at least proportionately to their representation in the Alberta \npopulation. Aboriginal Students Support Services continues to provide Indigenous students \nassistance so that they can be successful throughout their post-secondary experience at the U \nof A. An Indigenous Cultural Support Office has been initiated to support culturally sensitive \ndevelopment of initiatives, curriculum, and individual faculty and staff. Deliberate efforts will \ncontinue within faculties to encourage participation in enduring reconciliation. The university \nprovides multiple avenues to learn about historical relationships between the Indigenous and \nC OMPR E HE N S I VE  I NS T I TU T ION A L  PL A N  -  DR A FT \n54 \nD\nR\nA\nF\nnon-Indigenous communities through traditional classroom offerings across several faculties in \naddition to the new Indigenous Canada MOOC.  \nC OMPR E HE N S I VE  I NS T I TU T ION A L  PL A N  -  DR A FT \n55 \nD\nR\nA\nF\nAPPENDIX E \nINTERNATIONALIZATION \nThe University of Alberta’s international collaborations create exceptional learning, discovery, \ncitizenship, and innovation opportunities. Such collaborations position the U of A among the \nworld’s top public institutions, and advance the university’s international reputation for \nexcellence in teaching and learning. The U of A actively cultivates a diverse academy that \nwelcomes international students and scholars and that offers Albertans a world-class, globally \nminded education.  \nIn conjunction with the implementation of the university’s strategic plan, For the Public Good, in \n2017-18, the U of A will establish an internal leadership structure to guide strategic engagement \non international initiatives. The President’s Committee on International Strategy will ensure that \nthe university’s approach to global engagement continues to reflect a forward-looking, system-\nwide perspective.  \nSpecific priorities for 2017-20 include exploring strategic options to further diversify the \nuniversity’s population of international students while maintaining the overall proportion of \ninternational students among the student body. A large majority of Alberta’s international \nstudents will remain in Alberta post-graduation (84 per cent, according to the 2012 Graduate \nOutcomes Survey), and international students educated at the U of A provide the province with \nadditional highly-skilled, innovative, and entrepreneurial professionals. They also bring cultural \ndiversity together with global connections, insights, and perspectives on shared issues and \nchallenges.  \nThe university also remains focused on delivering international education by providing study \nabroad and global engagement opportunities to our students, offering experiential, internship, \nand co-operative education experiences in over 60 countries, as well as multiple joint and dual \ndegree programs with partner institutions from around the world. The Alberta School of Business \nalso offers a Master of Financial Management program in China in partnership with Xi’an Jiao \nTong University (89 full-time registrants in 2015-16). A complete list of the university’s \ninternational shared credential (joint/dual degree) programs is provided in the university’s 2016 \nAnnual Report, available at ualberta.ca/reporting.  \nAs a research-intensive institution, the U of A pursues active collaborations with partners all over \nthe world. Global research engagement has many benefits to the U of A and the province, \nincluding leveraging funding resources and expertise from other parts of the globe to address \nchallenges that affect everyone, including Albertans. Key research partnerships are addressed \nin Appendix C. \nC OMPR E HE N S I VE  I NS T I TU T ION A L  PL A N  -  DR A FT \n56 \nD\nR\nA\nF\nAPPENDIX F \nCAPITAL PLAN \nCapital planning considerations: strategic investment \nand long-range planning \nBackground \nAs Alberta’s largest and oldest post-secondary institution, the University of Alberta manages \nmore than 1.8 million square metres of complex facility inventory, ranging in age from more than \n100 years old to new. With the completion of the Institutional Strategic Plan, For the Public \nGood, and aligned with the Government’s Adult Learning System’s Principles of accessibility, \naffordability, quality, coordination and accountability, the university has refined its focus to \naddress deferred maintenance and functional renewal and repurposing of existing physical \nassets, as well as reviewing how underused space can provide cost-effective opportunities for \nconsolidation and repurposing to enhance space in order to build essential teaching and \nresearch capacity. With this key work completed, critical expansions would be required only to \nmeet the needs of tomorrow’s students, teachers and researchers, and to maintain the \ninstitution’s competitive global position. \nWith five well-established major campuses to support, the U of A has carefully evaluated its \nacademic requirements across all areas to ensure that all capital investments form part of the \nlong-term vision in support of For the Public Good. These priority investments would capitalize \non the utilization of existing, but old and functionally inadequate, infrastructure. Through \nrenovation and repurposing, the university would initially reduce its current level of deferred \nmaintenance ($938 million) by approximately $100-150 million, depending on the level of capital \ninvestment available. \nBy reclaiming classroom space for faculties that are badly space-constrained, university \npriorities improve program outcomes across a number of key faculties and, in some instances, \nwill negate the requirement for a new build. Reclaimed space reduces reliance on leased space, \nsets up the conditions for projects to support multiple faculties, and results in a ‘domino’ effect to \nsupport other faculties on North Campus through the provision of purpose-designed and built \nspace and the repurposing and renovation of vacated space in multiple buildings. Additionally, \ninvestment in the Augustana and Campus Saint-Jean campuses is key to maintaining and \ndeveloping programming for rural liberal arts and sciences as well as the only fully bilingual \npostsecondary education campus in western Canada. \nDeferred maintenance \nRecent investment in new facilities has created an opportunity, through backfill of vacated \nspace, to creatively address physical and functional renewal of our buildings. Many older \nfacilities were not designed to accommodate the functional and operational requirements of \ncurrent and future faculty and students (Faculty Renewal and Student Experience), nor are they \nparticularly energy efficient. Combining functional and physical renewal projects through backfill \nprojects provides a best-value model for capital projects, minimizing the need for new buildings \nwhile facilitating the needs of tomorrow’s learners and researchers, all at a significantly reduced \ncapital cost. \nC OMPR E HE N S I VE  I NS T I TU T ION A L  PL A N  -  DR A FT \n57 \nD\nR\nA\nF\nObjectives:  \n● Maximize opportunities to identify and proactively address deferred maintenance and \nfunctional renewal, through joint renewal and repurposing projects for existing building \ninventory that would also focus on energy and carbon footprint reductions and support \nthe move to renewable energy on an opportunity basis. \n● Ensure stable, long-term funding for deferred maintenance, and work with government to \ndevelop funding strategies that could support increased and sustained funding in the \norder of $25 million to $40 million annually. \n● Continue to maintain and improve the condition and functionality of the university’s \nphysical assets, which plays a critical role in our ability to attract, support, and retain the \nbest students, faculty, and staff. \n● Reduce the risk of building system failures that could affect life safety or result in building \nclosures. \n● Maintain the reliability of the university’s utility plant through focused investment in the \nfunctional renewal that deals with both deferred maintenance and increased efficiency \nwith new technology. \n● Support the academic and research goals of the institution and maximize use and life of \nexisting infrastructure, by ensuring that space is functional for current and future learning \nand research. \nPlanning \nIn order for high quality and detailed pre-design and planning services (including functional \nprogramming to lock scope) to be conducted, a multi-year allocation of planning funds is \nrequired. This will allow the university to focus specialist resources in support of program and \nbudget accuracy in order to be in position to develop innovative solutions that maximize the \nutilization of existing space while minimizing our ecological and carbon footprint, allowing us to \nimplement projects as funding becomes available. \nObjectives: \n● In the short-term, seek funding for pre-design services (including the development of \nbusiness cases) related to strategic priorities and major opportunities, or mandate both, \nto provide greater scope and budget certainty and to enable responses to new funding in \na timely manner.  \n● As greater levels of funding become available, seek a long-term funding envelope \nprogram that would include government contributions through capital and Climate \nLeadership grants as well as partnered contributions from internal sources where \npossible. \n● Provide strong and clear campus planning documents that are rooted in sustainability \nand leading urban design principles. The plans will seek to provide necessary direction, \nensuring academic program needs of the university are met, with careful consideration to \nthe expressed interests of the surrounding neighbourhoods and communities. \n● Reduce the university’s reliance on expensive, long-term commercial leasing with better \npre-design planning that anticipates the university’s quickly-changing space needs. \nC OMPR E HE N S I VE  I NS T I TU T ION A L  PL A N  -  DR A FT \n58 \nD\nR\nA\nF\nCapital projects, BLIMS and investment priorities  \nThe following strategic capital investment priorities are focused on improved asset utilization, \nreducing risk and deferred maintenance, repurposing existing infrastructure and reducing \nreliance on leased space while focusing on academic program outcomes in line with For the \nPublic Good.  \nFor each campus, two tables are presented. The first, “Capital Project Priority,” reflects projects \nthat have been previously identified to government as top priorities for funding consideration. \nThe second, “BLIMS Project Priorities,” identifies additional capital needs that have been \nsubmitted through the government’s Building and Land Information Management System \n(BLIMS).  \nInvestments are broken down by campus as follows: \nAugustana Campus  \nTable 1.

These include four in Lister Hall, and two in the \nCentral Academic Building.  \nPotential Projects with Carbon Reduction Opportunities in Support of Alberta’s \nClimate Leadership Plan \nThe following projects have been identified as potential contributors to reducing the university’s \ncarbon footprint in support of province-wide initiatives to reduce Alberta’s carbon emissions and \ncontribute to sustainability. \nCameron Library \nCameron Library has a significant building envelope problem with failure of exterior paneling \nsupports resulting in panels falling off the building face, presenting both a safety concern and a \ndirect impact to building operations. The condition of the exterior envelope is such that a full \nreplacement is required. \nThe project has been approached as a demonstration project showing that with student \nengagement it is possible to address deferred maintenance renewal of existing buildings in a \nmanner that trains the next generation of engineers and designers in the renewal of aged \nbuildings. Specific skills that students have brought to the project include; energy modelling, \ncreation of an intelligent Building Information Model, examination of various types of building \nenvelope solutions, solutions for embedded green poser and renewed mechanical systems with \nsolar thermal storage. Additionally, the project has a defined goal of 50 per cent reduction in \nenergy for an existing building with incorporation of solar thermal, photovoltaic, natural light \nreflectors and a thermal wall.  \nUniversiade Pavilion - Butterdome  \nThe building envelope for the Butterdome is deteriorating with significant rusting out of the \nexterior panel system. Reviews of the envelope have determined that the panel system will have \nto be completely replaced and the rain screen assembly renewed. A design review has been \nundertaken which incorporates retaining the identity of the building while supporting the \ninstallation of photovoltaic (PV) panels in the new wall system creating a significant green power \nsource and greenhouse gas reduction for the campus. The project has been planned to \nincorporate campus research for PV systems which provides demonstration projects for \nstudents on the skills required for a new workforce for new building envelope technologies. The \nproject will have a significant visual impact that can be pointed to as a great example of a \nbuilding renewal incorporating green energy. \nGreen Labs Program \nThe University of Alberta's Green Labs program supports our research community in building \nhealthy, safe and green teaching and research labs. Labs can use considerable amounts of \nwater, electricity and consumable materials. This program makes it easier for researchers to \nmaintain environmentally-responsible and healthy laboratory workspaces and engage in \npractices that reduce their ecological footprint, improve energy efficiency, conserve water and \nreduce waste. This program influences change through networking behaviour change programs, \nand incenting the use of ecologically preferable equipment.  \nSouth Campus District Energy System \nThe U of A proposes building a District Energy System (DES), incorporating combined heat and \npower (CHP), to meet the energy requirements of new facilities and to transition existing \nfacilities to the DES. It will have the ability to service government facilities in the future as the \nC OMPR E HE N S I VE  I NS T I TU T ION A L  PL A N  -  DR A FT \n63 \nD\nR\nA\nF\nopportunity becomes available. DES, including CHP, can make significant contributions to \nreducing GHG emissions. \nHighlights \nSummary of ongoing major capital projects \n● Research and Collection Resource Facility: $30 million (debt financed), turnover planned \nfor Sept 2017.

On budget and \nschedule. \n● SIF: see above \nEnergy Management \nEnergy Management Program  \nGiven the success of the University of Alberta’s energy management program (EMP), the \nuniversity initiated a new round of energy projects for campus facilities. As in previous years, the \nnext generation of the EMP is financed through borrowing and paid back through resulting \nenergy savings. The accumulated impact of ongoing and significant investment in energy \nmanagement initiatives has aided in reducing greenhouse gas emissions and lowering operating \ncosts, added renewable energy to plant capacity, and contributed significantly in a partnership \napproach to the reduction of the deferred maintenance liability. For fiscal 2014-15 the utility cost \navoidance for the measures undertaken is estimated at $16,732,112. Since the inception of the \nUniversity of Alberta’s energy management program in 1975, the total accumulated cost \navoidance is estimated at $336 million. \nSustainability \nThe U of A’s Sustainability Commitment and Guiding Principles articulate our commitment to a \ncontinuous effort to instill sustainability into the many aspects of university life, on our \ncampuses, in our institution, and in the larger community of which we are part. The U of A \nstrives to manage all resources in harmony, recognizing the interconnectedness of ecological, \nsocial and economic systems.  \nThe U of A’s campus sustainability initiative is facilitated by the Office of Sustainability and \nguided by the goals and strategies outlined in both the Institutional Strategic Plan and \nSustainability Plan. The university monitors and reports our performance using the Sustainability \nTracking, Assessment & Rating System (STARS™). Developed by the Association for the \nAdvancement of Sustainability in Higher Education, this tool monitors performance in education \nand research, operations, planning, planning, administration, and engagement. The university \nattained a STARS™ Gold rating in 2014 (up from a Silver rating in 2012). The U of A will \ncomplete its third STARS™ assessment in 2017.  \nC OMPR E HE N S I VE  I NS T I TU T ION A L  PL A N  -  DR A FT \n64 \nD\nR\nA\nF\nUtilities \nThe District Energy System (DES), serving the U of A’s North Campus and other partners in the \nGreater Campus Area (GCA), has a number of priorities that address expansion and reliability \nissues. The first is to replace the aging electrical infrastructure in the Heating Plant. Phase two \nof approximately 8 phases has just been completed. This project is funded through Utilities \nreserves. The second major project is the expansion and upgrade of the electrical service from \nEPCOR’s Garneau substation to the U of A. This project is in preliminary design and regulatory \nphase and will require funding, for the GCA portion, from government to proceed. \nOn the U of A’s South Campus, in addition to the DES project identified above, the upgrade of \nbasic infrastructure, including the electrical service, needs to be addressed to accommodate \nfurther growth on this campus.  \nC OMPR E HE N S I VE  I NS T I TU T ION A L  PL A N  -  DR A FT \n65 \nD\nR\nA\nF\nAPPENDIX G \nINFORMATION TECHNOLOGY \nInformation Technology activities for the next three years will focus primarily on ensuring the \nadequacy and sustainability of institutional systems to support the university’s initiatives to drive \naccess, quality, coordination, and accountability and to implement the Institutional Strategic \nPlan, For the Public Good. There is a strong need to coordinate IT activities and acquisitions as \nIT infrastructure becomes fundamental to teaching, learning, research, data storage and \nreporting, and indeed living at the university. The university will pursue the following priorities \nover the next three year period:  \nInstitutional data and reporting \nThe university will pursue the continuous improvement and coordination of systems and \nprocedures through further development of the institutional data warehouse and associated \ninstitutional reporting, in support of the university’s coordination and accountability objectives. \nThis will be supported by base budget through the Campus Alberta Grant. \nBudgeting and Planning \nIn 2017-18, the U of A will implement new cloud-based capability for budgeting and planning. \nPhase one of the implementation will focus on the university’s operating fund, replacing the \nuniversity’s legacy budgeting systems and introducing best practices in budget planning and \nforecasting processes. Phase two of the project will allow faculties and portfolios to use the new \nbudget tool to budget across all funds at the university.  \nFinance and Student Systems Upgrades \nThe university is preparing for major upgrades of the financial and student information modules \nof PeopleSoft. The latter will enhance access and facilitate innovative teaching by improving \nflexibility in course duration, and therefore in program structure. For example, the “3-11” initiative \nat Augustana campus (splitting the traditional term into a 3-week and an 11-week segment, \nallowing for a 3 week intensive study period followed by a more traditional multiple course load) \nwill support strategic academic goals. Pre-upgrade assessments are required to define the \nscope of these two projects precisely; these assessments will be supported through the Campus \nAlberta Grant. The ensuing projects will require larger investments ($2 million to $5 million each) \nand may require incremental funding. \nStudent Life-Cycle Review \nInformation Services and Technology is currently leading a cross-institutional consultation on \nsystems and processes supporting the student lifecycle—from recruitment to alumni. These \nsystems underpin the university’s accessibility initiatives, including in recruitment, admission, \nand the provision of student supports. This project will lead to comprehensive system and \ncapability roadmaps and portfolio coordination beginning in 2017-18. The primary goal is to \nmeet medium-term institutional needs more cost-effectively by anticipating and combining \nrequirements across faculties and central units. Cost estimates for specific initiatives will \nbecome known during 2017-18. \nC OMPR E HE N S I VE  I NS T I TU T ION A L  PL A N  -  DR A FT \n66 \nD\nR\nA\nF\nFLE Enrolment, Credential, Program and Specialization\nThe following table aligns with the enrolment reporting requirements as outlined in Advanced Education's 2017-2020 Comprehensive Institutional Plan (CIP) Guidelines:\nIn addition to the information requested by the GOA, the table includes U of As faculty and academic career.
