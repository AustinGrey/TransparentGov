            "Description": "Purpose of the Proposal: To introduce the draft Student Groups Policy suite for discussion and invite feedback. Discussion: Dr Costopoulos reported that the draft policy represents an endeavour to replace the current Student Groups Procedure in UAPPOL. He indicated that it includes goals and principles of formal recognition between the university and student groups, and the obligations and privileges related to this formal relationship. Dr Zwicker added that research supports a link between extracurricular activities and mental health and academic performance. She then provided a summary of the procedures noting that they include a clear description of decision-making processes as well as clarification surrounding expectations and responsibilities for all involved parties, including appeal processes. During the discussion, members thanked the proposers for their consultation on the draft documents. In addition, they raised several points of clarification surrounding the draft proposal, including the denial of recognition of a student group based on duplication; the administrative burden of managing student groups; the timing of events approval; and the appeal processes. A member noted the Students’ Union (SU) objection to the utilization of the definition of Risk to Reputation and, in response, Dr Costopoulos replied that the Board of Governors must consider Risk to Reputation as part of their fiduciary duty and this definition evolved during the process of consultation. Members engaged in discussion related to the risk assessment process and security costs used for some events on campus. The Chair thanked Dr Costopoulos for his presentation. ",

​RESIDENCE​ ​DISCIPLINE​ ​STATISTICS​ ​2016-2017 \nSubmitted​ ​to​ ​the​ ​Campus​ ​Law​ ​Review​ ​Committee,​ ​September​ ​15th,​ ​2017.  \nIn​ ​accordance​ ​with​ ​the​ ​Campus​ ​Law​ ​Review​ ​Committee​ ​Terms​ ​of​ ​Reference​ ​the​ ​following \nResidence​ ​Discipline​ ​Report​ ​summarizes​ ​the​ ​period​ ​of​ ​May​ ​1st,​ ​2016​ ​to​ ​August​ ​31st,​ ​2017.  \nResidence​ ​Services​ ​has​ ​been​ ​utilizing​ ​Restorative​ ​Justice​ ​for​ ​six​ ​years​ ​now.​ ​We​ ​continue​ ​to​ ​see \nrestorative​ ​solutions​ ​being​ ​used​ ​as​ ​the​ ​primary​ ​mechanism​ ​for​ ​addressing​ ​student​ ​conduct​ ​in​ ​our \nresidence​ ​system.​ ​Anecdotally,​ ​our​ ​staff​ ​have​ ​also​ ​reported​ ​that​ ​student​ ​acceptance​ ​and​ ​usage​ ​of \nrestorative​ ​language​ ​and​ ​acceptance​ ​of​ ​the​ ​concept​ ​of​ ​Restorative​ ​Justice​ ​appears​ ​to​ ​be \nimproving​ ​as​ ​well.  \nDespite​ ​the​ ​successes​ ​we​ ​are​ ​seeing,​ ​we​ ​still​ ​face​ ​challenges.​ ​Last​ ​year​ ​we​ ​reported​ ​that​ ​we \nbegan​ ​utilizing​ ​Restorative​ ​Justice​ ​when​ ​dealing​ ​with​ ​Operations​ ​related​ ​issues.​ ​Such​ ​issues \ninclude:​ ​unauthorized​ ​tenants​ ​(subletting),​ ​cleanliness,​ ​and​ ​response​ ​to​ ​pest​ ​treatments.​ ​​ ​This \nprocess​ ​is​ ​continuing​ ​to​ ​develop​ ​and​ ​further​ ​training​ ​will​ ​be​ ​necessary​ ​within​ ​those​ ​units​ ​to \nensure​ ​consistent​ ​application​ ​of​ ​Restorative​ ​Justice​ ​and​ ​restorative​ ​principles.​ ​​ ​.​ ​We​ ​also​ ​look​ ​to \ncontinue​ ​to​ ​build​ ​capacity​ ​with​ ​our​ ​Residence​ ​Life​ ​professional​ ​staff,​ ​having​ ​lost​ ​many​ ​of​ ​our \nstaff​ ​with​ ​significant​ ​experience​ ​in​ ​facilitating​ ​Restorative​ ​Justice​ ​in​ ​recent​ ​years.  \nAs​ ​was​ ​reported​ ​last​ ​year,​ ​our​ ​Housing​ ​Management​ ​System​ ​software​ ​​ ​ceased​ ​support​ ​of​ ​​ ​the \njudicial​ ​module​ ​in​ ​July​ ​of​ ​2016.​ ​Data​ ​becomes​ ​increasingly​ ​difficult​ ​to​ ​scrub​ ​and​ ​though​ ​we​ ​do \nnot​ ​feel​ ​that​ ​the​ ​validity​ ​of​ ​our​ ​numbers​ ​is​ ​any​ ​less​ ​reliable,​ ​the​ ​need​ ​for​ ​a​ ​new​ ​system​ ​has \nbecome​ ​increasingly​ ​evident.​ ​When​ ​combing​ ​through​ ​this​ ​year’s​ ​numbers,​ ​we​ ​realized​ ​a​ ​glitch​ ​in \nthe​ ​calculation​ ​of​ ​last​ ​year’s​ ​statistics,​ ​as​ ​the​ ​default​ ​reporting​ ​causes​ ​some​ ​incidents​ ​to​ ​be \nreported​ ​twice.​ ​When​ ​we​ ​scrubbed​ ​the​ ​data​ ​this​ ​year​ ​we​ ​sought​ ​to​ ​remove​ ​these​ ​duplicates.​ ​It​ ​is \nunclear​ ​whether​ ​the​ ​duplicates​ ​from​ ​last​ ​year​ ​were​ ​material​ ​in​ ​the​ ​overall​ ​reporting.​ ​However,​ ​we \nfelt​ ​it​ ​important​ ​to​ ​bring​ ​to​ ​this​ ​group​ ​now​ ​that​ ​we’ve​ ​identified​ ​this​ ​software​ ​glitch. \nWe​ ​continue​ ​to​ ​track​ ​our​ ​judicial​ ​statistics​ ​using​ ​two​ ​criteria:​ ​violations,​ ​and​ ​sanctions.​ ​This \nallows​ ​us​ ​to​ ​more​ ​accurately​ ​reflect​ ​restorative​ ​principles​ ​in​ ​our​ ​judicial​ ​statistics.​ ​A​ ​key​ ​factor \nof​ ​Restorative​ ​Justice​ ​is​ ​that​ ​it​ ​does​ ​not​ ​focus​ ​on​ ​a​ ​‘rule’​ ​that​ ​was​ ​broken;​ ​instead​ ​it​ ​focuses​ ​on \nthe​ ​harms​ ​that​ ​come​ ​from​ ​a​ ​person’s​ ​actions.​ ​Accordingly,​ ​violations​ ​are​ ​based​ ​on​ ​the​ ​behaviour \nof​ ​the​ ​student​ ​that​ ​causes​ ​harm.​ ​Sanctions​ ​are​ ​the​ ​results​ ​of​ ​those​ ​violations.​ ​In​ ​many​ ​cases,​ ​a \nsingle​ ​restorative​ ​sanction​ ​can​ ​address​ ​the​ ​harms​ ​of​ ​several​ ​violations​ ​(for​ ​example,​ ​an​ ​apology \nto​ ​an​ ​entire​ ​community​ ​may​ ​be​ ​sufficient​ ​to​ ​address​ ​multiple​ ​harms​ ​caused).  \nIn​ ​2016/2017,​ ​we​ ​had​ ​1,446​ ​unique​ ​incidents.​ ​This​ ​represents​ ​a​ ​35%​ ​increase​ ​over​ ​last​ ​year’s \nnumber​ ​(1,064​ ​unique​ ​incidents);​ ​this​ ​increase​ ​is​ ​largely​ ​due​ ​to​ ​increase​ ​in​ ​the​ ​number​ ​of \nreported​ ​incidents​ ​(Maintenance,​ ​Operations,​ ​student​ ​staff)​ ​​ ​without​ ​any​ ​follow-up.  \nFor​ ​example,​ ​maintenance​ ​incidents​ ​get​ ​reported​ ​by​ ​our​ ​staff​ ​in​ ​the​ ​Housing​ ​Management \nSystem​ ​but​ ​there​ ​is​ ​rarely​ ​any​ ​follow-up​ ​initiated​ ​from​ ​our​ ​Residence​ ​Life​ ​team.​ ​Maintenance​ ​is \ndoubly​ ​reported​ ​through​ ​another​ ​system​ ​which​ ​initiates​ ​action​ ​on​ ​their​ ​part​ ​and​ ​the​ ​reporting​ ​in \nour​ ​Housing​ ​Management​ ​System​ ​merely​ ​serves​ ​as​ ​a​ ​backstop​ ​but​ ​also​ ​as​ ​a​ ​means​ ​for \ndocumenting​ ​our​ ​staff’s​ ​involvement​ ​in​ ​the​ ​community.​ ​The​ ​number​ ​of​ ​these​ ​types​ ​of​ ​‘none \nspecified’​ ​incidents​ ​accounted​ ​for​ ​49%​ ​of​ ​the​ ​unique​ ​incidents​ ​that​ ​were​ ​reported​ ​in​ ​the​ ​last​ ​year. \nOf​ ​the​ ​remaining​ ​735​ ​incidents,​ ​517​ ​or​ ​70%​ ​utilized​ ​restorative​ ​solutions​ ​(Community \nResolutions,​ ​Alcohol​ ​Abstention,​ ​Apology​ ​Letters,​ ​Restitution,​ ​Behavioural​ ​Agreements,​ ​or \nRestorative​ ​Agreements).​ ​This​ ​is​ ​a​ ​slight​ ​reduction​ ​from​ ​last​ ​year’s​ ​figure​ ​of​ ​83%,​ ​however​ ​the \ncontinued​ ​emphasis​ ​of​ ​utilizing​ ​Restorative​ ​Justice​

Student Conduct and Accountability Statistical Report \nPrepared by: <Deborah Eerkes, Director, SCA, deerkes@ualberta.ca> \nSTATISTICAL REPORT\n2016/17   ACADEMIC YEAR\nwww.ualberta.ca/studentconduct     \nSTUDENT CONDUCT AND \nACCOUNTABILITY (SCA)\nMANDATE\nStudent Conduct and Accountability (SCA) is mandated to deal \nwith issues around the Code of Student Behaviour. Approaching \nthe Code in terms of awareness, prevention and student \ndiscipline, SCA strives to ensure that students understand the \nexpectations placed upon them by the Code and are able to \nparticipate freely and fully in the university community.\nWhen students are alleged to have engaged in behaviour \nthat violates the Code of Student Behaviour, one of the two \nDiscipline Officers in SCA is assigned to make a decision \naccording to the procedures set out in the Code.  Faculty \nDeans (or designate) make recommendations for severe \nsanctions in academic misconduct cases, while University of \nThe two Discipline Officers completed a total of 46 decisions \nin the 2016/17 academic year. In order to align the numbers \nwith those collected by the Appeals and Compliance Officer, \nthe decisions counted in this report include those in which the \nappeal deadline falls between July 1, 2016, and June 30, 2017. \nThe matters before the Discipline Officers are complex, often \ninvolving legal or procedural considerations. Investigations take \non average 25.25 hours to complete, although the time required \nranged from 7 hours for the simplest decision to 85 hours for \nthe most complex. The majority of the cases fell within the  \n15-30 hour range. \nMost academic violations are handled solely at the Faculty level \nwith Intermediate Sanctions under the Code. Appropriately, \nonly the most egregious cases are referred to SCA with \nrecommendations for Severe Sanctions. These cases tend to \nbe more complex in nature and often involve prior offences. \nBecause the statistics cited herein apply strictly to Student \nConduct and Accountability, any trends identified in terms of \nacademic misconduct must not be generalized to the entire \nUniversity. For a total number of academic offences that did not \ninvolve a referral to the Discipline Officer, please refer to the \nAppeals Coordinator’s report from University Governance.\nAlberta Protective Services (UAPS) or Unit Directors make \nrecommendations for charges and sanctions in non-academic \nmisconduct cases. The Discipline Officer meets with the student \nalleged to have committed the misconduct, investigates the \ncomplaint if the facts are in dispute, and makes a finding on \nwhether the student violated the Code. If the student is found \nresponsible, the Discipline Officer decides what sanctions are \nwarranted, using the recommendation from the complainant as \na starting point.\nThroughout the 2016/17 academic year, Deborah Eerkes and \nChris Hackett were the two Discipline Officers under the Code \nof Student Behaviour.\nUAPS investigates allegations of non-academic misconduct, \nand of those that fall under the Code of Student Behaviour, \nsends recommendations for charges and sanctions to the \nDiscipline Officer. In addition, Unit Directors can recommend \ncharges and sanctions to the Discipline Officer for allegations \nof Inappropriate Use of University Property and Resources \nrelating to their own units. \nFinally, the Discipline Officers are responsible to make decisions \nin two kinds of appeals: \n1. Students can appeal a UAPS Violation Notice to the \nDiscipline Officer when they are disputing the facts. The \nDiscipline Officer can uphold or deny the appeal, or vary \nthe fine on the Violation Notice. \n2. The second type of appeal relates to complaints made to \nUAPS in which the Director decides not to recommend \ncharges under the Code. The complainant can appeal to \nthe Discipline Officer, who makes a decision on whether \nit was reasonable not to lay charges under the Code, or \nwhether an investigation should proceed. In the latter case, \nthe Discipline Officer will initiate an investigation, make a \nfinding and render a decision. This is a change to procedure \nin the Code of Student Behaviour that took effect in \nSeptember 2015, and significantly simplifies the process.\nDISCIPLINE CASES\n2\nThe 46 case files for the 2016/17 academic year showed a \nsignificant decrease from the previous year. 1 of those cases was \na student appeal, and did not involve charges against a student. \nThe complexity and seriousness of the offences is reflected in \nthe sanctions imposed in the remaining 45 cases, including 5 \nTRENDS\nexpulsions, 3 exclusions, 14 suspensions, 28 orders of conduct \nprobation, 1 suspension of services, 1 order of restitution \nand one case in which no additional sanctions were imposed. \nCharges were dismissed in 5 cases.  \nDisposition\n2016/17 Sanctions\nConduct Probation  53%\nExpulsion  9%\nExclusion 6%\nSuspend Services  2%\nRestitution  2%\nNo Add’l sanction  2%\nSuspension  26%\nFig. 1  Disposition of Decisions of the Discipline Officer\n3\nFig. 2  Severe Sanctions - 3 year comparison\nSuspension\nExpulsion\n0\n12\n6\n18\n3\n15\n24\n27\n30\n9\n21\n2014/15 2015/16\nN\nu\nm\nb\ner\n o\nf S\nan\nct\nio\nn\ns\n2016/17\n18\n29\n3\n14\n55\nFig. 3  Disposition of Decisions of the Discipline Officer – 3 year comparison\nNote: Some cases result in multiple sanctions, therefore the total number of sanctions imposed (58) is greater than the number of cases (45).\n* In addition to any sanctions imposed by Dean or Unit Director\nDISCIPLINE OFFICER SANCTION*\nNUMBER IMPOSED\n2014/15 2015/16 2016/17\nExpulsion 5 3 5\nSuspension 18 29 14\nConduct Probation 27 45 28\nFine 2 3 0\nExclusion 7 9 3\nSuspension University Resources 0 0 1\nRestitution 2 2 1\nReprimand 0 0 0\nCharges upheld; no additional sanctions 0 0 1\nCharges dismissed; no sanction 4 3 5\nTotal Sanctions 65 94 58\nCOMPLAINANT \nNUMBER OF CASES COMPLETED\n2014/15 2015/16 2016/17\nACADEMIC\nAgricultural, Life and Environmental Sciences 2 0 1\nArts 6 10 8\nAugustana 0 2 0\nBusiness 1 6 1\nEngineering 1 1 1\nExtension 2 2 0\nFaculty of Graduate Studies and Research 3 1 3\nNursing 0 0 1\nPharmacy 0 0 1\nScience 3 1 3\nNON-\nACADEMIC\nUniversity of Alberta Protective Services 25 35 26\nStudent - Appeal of Violation Notice 0 1 0\nStudent - Appeal of UAPS decision not to proceed N/A 2 1\nFaculties submitted 19 of our 46 files in which students were \ncharged with academic offences, while roughly 60% came \nOf the 45 cases involving charges, 1 was appealed to the University Appeal Board (UAB), and that appeal was denied.\nfrom University of Alberta Protective Services (non-academic \nmisconduct).

The remaining \n5 violations were deemed sufficiently serious to warrant a \nsevere sanction for a first offence. \nAs is often the case, gender plays a role in non-academic \noffences: 25 out of 26 students who committed non-academic \noffences were male, 1 was female. Academic offences were \nroughly evenly split between the genders.  \nGender\nMALE FEMALE\n2014/15\nAcademic 13 6\nNon-Academic 20 5\n2015/16\nAcademic 13 10\nNon-Academic 22 13\n2016/17\nAcademic 10 9\nNon-Academic 25 1\nFig. 5  Case by Type and Gender (excluding student appeals)\nOf the 18 charges of Violation of Safety or Dignity, 13 involved \ngender-based violence. The nature of the conduct included \nsexual harassment, threats of violence, creating a condition that \nthreatens the safety or wellbeing of others, and sexual assault. \nIt must be understood that this number refers to only complaints \nmade under the Code of Student Behaviour to University of \nAlberta Protective Services, which are investigated and \nforwarded to the Discipline Officer with recommendations for \ncharges and sanctions. Thus, it represents a very specific part of \nthe picture of sexual violence at the University of Alberta. Code \ncharges can only be applied when 1) the person under allegation \nGender-Based Violence\nInternational students figured prominently as well: overall, \n44% of the students seeing a Discipline Officer in 2016/17 \nwere international students. The offences for which they were \nbeing charged weighed more heavily toward serious academic \noffences (12) than non-academic offences (8). \nInternational Students\n2014/15 2015/16 2016/17\nAcademic 11 10 12\nNon-academic 12 16 8\nTotal International students 23 26 20\nFig. 6  International students by case type – 3 year comparison \n5\nis a Student as defined by the Code, and 2) there is a “real and \nsubstantial link” to the University. \nIn addition, many who experience sexual violence choose only \nto disclose (without making a complaint) or not to tell anyone. \nThe Sexual Violence Policy, which came into effect in June 2017, \nhas made clear that students, staff and faculty will have access \nto support by the University whether they disclose or make a \ncomplaint of sexual violence. Note that the incidents recorded \nin this reporting year occurred before the implementation of \nthe Sexual Violence Policy and, therefore, are being reported \nusing the definitions under the Code.\nStudents are entitled to bring an Advisor of their choice with \nthem to meetings and hearings throughout the Code of Student \nBehaviour process. In 2016/17, 9 students brought advisors \nto their meetings with the Discipline Officer, all of them from \nOf the 45 cases in which students were charged under the \nCode, those students in upper years were more likely to \ncommit serious academic misconduct (either had a prior \noffence or committed a serious first offence).  By contrast, \nnon-academic offences were spread relatively evenly over \nthe year, being most common in 2nd or 3rd year. In total, 6 \nfirst-year students, 7 second-year students, 11 third-year \nstudents, and 1 fourth-year students committed violations. \nIn addition, 5 graduate students – 3 in Doctoral programs and \n2 working toward Masters’ degrees – were referred to SCA \nlast year.

Some statistics for previous years are also included \nfor comparison. \nThis report sets out information about discipline decisions and the appeal process under the Code of Student \nBehaviour (COSB) and the Code of Applicant Behaviour (COAB), with a focus on the university appeal level of the \nUniversity Appeal Board (UAB). This report also sets out information for the two other university level appeal \nbodies, the General Faculties Council Academic Appeals Committee (GFC AAC) and the General Faculties Council \nPractice Review Board (GFC PRB). \nRole of the Appeals Coordinator \nAs Appeals and Compliance Officer, I carry out the role of the Appeals Coordinator under the COSB, COAB, \nUniversity of Alberta Academic Appeals Policy and University of Alberta Practicum Intervention Policy for the \nUAB, GFC AAC and GFC PRB. In this role I am neutral and do not advocate for either party in an appeal. I \nfacilitate or administer the appeal process steps from the time an appeal is received, through the hearing and decision \nmade by an appeal panel, to distribution of the written decision. I also provide procedural information to the parties \nto an appeal and to the appeal panel throughout the appeal process. \nApart from individual appeals, I oversee the university level appeal system to ensure that the university continues to \nimplement a fair process by which to address appeals. This includes helping to educate panel members as to the \nframework within which they work when hearing appeals and helping the university community understand that \nframework.  \nUniversity Level Appeal Process \nThe university level appeal system is made up of three appeal bodies – the UAB, the GFC AAC and the GFC PRB. \nDiscipline decisions arise as a result of a student being charged with an offence (academic and/or non-academic) \nunder the COSB or COAB. When the appropriate decision-maker has made a final decision finding an offence and \nimposing a sanction, the parties to that decision have a final appeal to the UAB. \nPage 1 of 4\nAttachment 1.0 \nThe UAB generally hears appeals from students charged under the COSB or COAB who disagree with the discipline \ndecisions. UAB decisions are final and binding, within the university, subject to judicial review. Under the COSB \nthe UAB has the broad authority to determine whether an offence was committed and to confirm, vary or quash \nsanctions imposed. \nUnder the Academic Appeals Policy, academic standing issues are heard by the GFC AAC. The GFC AAC hears \nappeals from students wishing to appeal faculty decisions on matters of academic standing, including matters such \nas a requirement to withdraw, denial of graduation or promotion. The GFC AAC hears appeals from students after \nthey have exhausted all other avenues of appeal within a faculty. GFC AAC decisions are final and binding, within \nthe university, subject to judicial review. The authority of the GFC AAC is to uphold (and award any remedy not \ncontrary to faculty rules) or deny an appeal depending upon whether a miscarriage of justice, as defined by the \nAcademic Appeals Policy, occurred within the faculty process.  \nUnder the Practicum Intervention Policy, appeals concerning practicum interventions are heard by the GFC PRB. \nThe GFC PRB’s decisions are final and binding, within the university, subject to judicial review. \nPrinciples of the Appeal Process \nAppeals at the university level deal with complex issues affecting students, faculties and the university as a whole. \nGiven this impact, and the fact that this final level of appeal is the last opportunity for issues to be heard within the \nuniversity, it is very important that the appeal process is fair and perceived to be fair. Coming to decisions through a \nfair process also promotes confidence in those decisions by the parties and the appeal panels themselves. Being the \nfinal level of appeal, the decisions or process may also be subject to judicial scrutiny. \nThe authority of the appeal bodies (UAB/GFC AAC/GFC PRB) flows from the powers delegated under the Post-\nSecondary Learning Act. The appeal bodies carry out their authority as outlined in the applicable university appeal \npolicy, in keeping with the principles of administrative fairness. The principles of administrative fairness are the \nbasis for our appeals policies, help us to interpret those policies and provide the framework within which our appeal \npanels make decisions.    \nThe formal steps of our appeals process recognize the impact and finality of these decisions and ensure the \nopportunity for parties to an appeal to make their best cases and be heard. Our appeals process is not a court process, \nbut has been designed to allow for students and university decision-makers to be able to be heard by an objective \npanel coming from the university community. The system is flexible in that it is able to deal with a wide variety of \nappeals and circumstances (from students and university staff representing themselves or being helped by an advisor \nof their choosing) through consistently applying basic principles of administrative fairness. At its core, our appeals \nsystem involves the parties fully making their cases in writing and knowing the case of the other side before an \nappeal hearing takes place, then appearing at a hearing where they are able to present their arguments and \ninformation, subject to questioning, before an objective appeal panel.  (The UAB process also allows for the option \nof a paper-only or documentary review hearing, rather than an in-person hearing, when only the severity of sanction, \nPage 2 of 4\nAttachment 1.0 \nand not the offence, is being appealed.) The appeal panel then considers and weighs all of the submissions of the \nparties and comes to a decision, which it fully explains to the parties in writing. If any process issues or requests \narise before or during a hearing, the appeal panel chair (sometimes with the full appeal panel) decides how to fairly \naddress the issues, keeping in mind the relevant appeals policy and the principles of administrative fairness, \nincluding the aim of providing both parties a fair opportunity to be heard. \nCurrent Statistics \nLooking at the attached statistics, this year saw a small decrease in the number of UAB appeals but a similar overall \nnumber of appeals received at the university level compared to the previous year. Compared to the previous year, \n2016-2017 also saw a decrease in the number of discipline decisions made by Deans and Discipline Officers (381 \nthis year versus 429 the previous year), with the majority of those decisions concerning the academic offences of \nplagiarism and cheating. Although not statistically tracked, a significant number of appeals are received from \ninternational students.   \nWhile the provided statistics include general outcomes of the appeals heard, caution should be used before taking \nany trends from these outcomes. The sample size is very small and each case was decided on its own unique merits, \nwith the resulting statistics providing simply a snapshot of the outcomes for those particular cases heard and \ndecided.       \nAppeal Panel Membership \nThe university level appeal panels are made up of volunteer panel members. While the exact makeup of a panel \ndepends on the applicable appeal policy, generally the panels are a combination of undergraduate/graduate students \nand academic staff selected from the university’s appeal panel membership lists. (Membership is determined by an \napplication process and ultimately by approval of applicants by GFC.) Members serve on approximately six appeal \npanels within a calendar year, but this number varies depending on the number of appeals received and the faculties \ninvolved. Appeal panel members come from the greatest possible variety of faculties and the broadest possible \nrepresentation of the university community. For objectivity, no appeal panel member may sit on an appeal involving \na party from their faculty. Appeal hearings are scheduled throughout the academic year, including summer, mostly \nin evenings around academic schedules. Student panel members usually serve for terms of two years, while \nacademic staff panel members usually serve for terms of three years (with the possibility of serving additional \nterms).  \nIn addition to their understanding of the university environment from their experience as students (both \nundergraduate and graduate) and academic staff, our panel members are provided ongoing training in understanding \nthe principles of administrative fairness within which their tribunals operate. This helps to ensure that, as discussed \nabove, the appeal process is a fair one.     \nThe service of appeal panel members is a significant commitment, including considering and addressing procedural \nissues arising before and during hearings, conducting hearings, deliberating and drafting written reasons for  \nPage 3 of 4\nAttachment 1.0 \ndecisions. All of our panel members recognize the need to objectively hear submissions from parties to an appeal, \nanalyze and weigh evidence, then come to reasonable decisions based on that evidence. Part of my role is to ensure \nthat appeal panels have all the needed resources to perform their role. I thank all of our appeal panel members for \ntheir commitment and service to our university community. Their work is a very important contribution to fostering \nand maintaining the values of the university, for all members of our community. \nMichael Peterson \nAppeals and Compliance Officer \nUniversity Governance, University of Alberta  \nOctober 18, 2017 \nAttachments: Statistics for Discipline Decisions and the University Level Appeal Process \n[Statistics based upon year of appeal deadline.]   \nPage 4 of 4\nIndex of Attachments                            Attachment 2.0 \nINDEX OF ATTACHMENTS \nNumber of Appeals Attachment 2.1 \nFigure 1 ...................................................................................................................................................

At the same time, the University is responsible for taking reasonable steps to ensure the safety \nof all members of the University community and its visitors, to ensure the proper functioning of the \nUniversity, and for protecting and managing its property and reputation. In the context of these \nresponsibilities, the University of Alberta supports and encourages participation in Recognized Student \nGroups and in their events and activities as a valuable part of students’ University experience. \nThis policy and its related procedures do not limit the freedom of students and others to associate. \nStudents who associate as part of an unrecognized group, however, do not have access to the privileges \nthat are available to Recognized Student Groups. \nPROCEDURES THAT APPLY TO RECOGNIZED STUDENT GROUPS AND THEIR MEMBERS \n U of A Policies and Procedures On-Line (UAPPOL) \nThe Student Groups Recognition Procedure sets out the process to form a Recognized Student Group, \nthe privileges and responsibilities of recognition, when recognition may be denied or revoked, and a \nprocess of review where Recognition has been denied or revoked. \nThe Student Groups Activities and Events Procedure sets out general responsibilities in connection with \nStudent Group Events and Activities, the obligation of Recognized Student Groups to submit their \nproposed events for review and approval, some of the conditions that event approvals may be subject to, \nand a process of reconsideration where event approval has been denied or revoked.  \nThe Code of Student Behaviour applies to individual students of the University and its application is not \nprecluded by reason of an individual’s membership in a Recognized Student Group or where an \nindividual’s misconduct occurs in connection with a Student Group Event and Activity.   \nVALUES AND PRINCIPLES \nThe following values and principles guide the application of this policy and its related procedures.  \n1. Opportunities for students to engage in diverse co-curricular and extracurricular activities, \nincluding those offered through Recognized Student Groups, is a valuable part of students’ \nUniversity experience and should be supported. \n2. The University is responsible for taking reasonable steps to ensure the safety of all members of \nthe University community and its visitors, to ensure the proper functioning of the University, and \nfor protecting and managing its property and reputation.. \n3. Recognized Student Groups acknowledge the University’s responsibilities and that both they and \nthe University have obligations to maintain a safe and proper functioning living, learning, and \nworking environment. \n4. Transparency, open communication, and a collaborative approach should characterize the \nrelationship between Recognized Student Groups and the University. \n5. Recognized Student Groups are responsible for funding and bearing the costs occasioned by \ntheir events and activities, noting that the University contributes many other resources to support \nRecognized Student Groups and their events and activities. \nDEFINITIONS \nAny definitions listed in the following table apply to this document only with no implied or intended \ninstitution-wide use.

The University environment encourages the formation of different Student Groups. These groups may be \ndefined in a variety of ways, according to, for example, a shared program of study, a commitment to service, a \ncommon activity, philosophy or background or particular perspective. When considering a group’s application for \nRegistration, the University takes into account the group’s stated purposes, goals, activities, membership criteria and \nother attributes. The University desires to support the activities of Student Groups, but also recognizes the need to\nregulate them for the benefit of the groups themselves and the University community. When a Student Group is \nRecognized by the University, responsibilities and benefits result for both. \nWhen sponsoring or conducting a Student Group Event or Activity, Student Groups are also accountable to the \nUniversity for the conduct of their members and/or guests. While Student Group status is considered in this \nProcedure, complaints regarding the conduct of individual members of a group and their guests will be addressed \nunder the Code of Student Behaviour and/or through other University policies, procedures or other appropriate \nprocesses. \nPurpose\nTo outline the University’s processes for the administration of Student Groups. \nPROCEDURE\n1. RESPONSIBILITIES AND BENEFITS \nIn Registering with the University, a Student Group accepts the following responsibilities: \nTo abide by all University policies and procedures, and all applicable municipal bylaws, Provincial \nand Federal statutes and regulations; \nTo uphold the good name of the University; \nTo live up to the group's stated purpose by acting in accordance with the group’s constitution, \nbylaws and polices;\nTo respect the safety, security and inherent dignity of each member of the University community; \nTo be responsible for members' conduct when members are representing the group, and therefore \nthe University, on and off-campus; and\nTo manage the group’s assets (financial or otherwise) in a responsible and ethical manner.\nU of A Policies and Procedures On-Line (UAPPOL)\nA Student Group enjoys a number of benefits, including: \nAbility to book space with the University;\nUse of the University's institutional liquor licenses and the ability to receive permission for gaming \nevents; \nUse of the University's name and insignia; \nExclusive use of the group's name on campus;\nAccess to and ability to rent University property and equipment; \nUse of campus facilities for solicitation of membership.\nAll of the above benefits are subject to applicable University of Alberta policies, procedures and regulations.\nThis Procedure in no way limits the freedom of students and others to associate; however, groups of \nstudents not Recognized by the Dean of Students will not have access to the above benefits. \n2. REGISTRATION REQUIREMENTS \nIn order to be Recognized as a Student Group, approval must be obtained by following these registration \nprocedures.\nStudent Groups must file a Registration application annually with the University through Student Group \nServices. In addition to Registering with the University, Student Groups may also register with the Students’ \nUnion or the Graduate Students’ Association subject to meeting the requirements for those organizations. \nTo become a Recognized University of Alberta Student Group, a group must complete the appropriate \nRegistration Form (available on www.bearsden.ualberta.ca) and must be able to provide satisfactory \nevidence of the following: \nThat a minimum of ten (10) students are members of the group and that and all of the executive \nmembers with voting privileges are currently part-time or full-time University of Alberta students.\nWhen groups have more than ten (10) student members, the remaining ratio of members must be \ncomprised of two-thirds current University of Alberta students. In relation to Fraternities and\nSororities, the membership must be composed entirely of part-time or full-time University of Alberta \nstudents registered during the current academic year.  \nThat an acceptable constitution exists.
