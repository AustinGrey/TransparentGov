Discussion: Ms Collins provided members with a summary the Undergraduate National Recruitment Strategy and Key Performance Indicators and Measures. She noted that the strategy was developed in a highly consultative manner. She reported on the continued emphasis on access for Alberta students and alignment with For the Public Good. Ms Padfield explained that as part of this strategy, national recruitment efforts have increased. She explained that interest has been good in the targeted markets as well as from within the Alberta. Members discussed the time between application and letters of acceptance at the University of Alberta. In response, Ms Collins noted that a 2015 survey of students who declined admission reflected that only 9% cited early admission offers and that other factors such as location and funding are also contributing factors. Members engaged in discussion regarding how the strategy varies from province to province. A member enquired whether there has been an increase of applicants from within Alberta due to the current economic climate. Members also discussed a potential strategy towards offering more information to high school students about the transition into the post-secondary environment, as well as a focus on recruiting within Quebec to both Faculté Saint-Jean and to programs for English language students.",

She reported that the changes would not impact the courses offered, but rather would broaden the list of options available for students.

Summary of PVC Review for FoMD (page(s) 1 – 6) \nPrepared by: Bobbi Schiestel, Director, Office of the President, bobbi.schiestel@ualberta.ca \nItem 5 - page 3\nFaculty of Medicine Dentistry Response\n2016 President's Visiting Committee Report\nVersion 5 September 12, 2016 1 of 5\nFOMD Response To PVC Accountable Lead Timeline PVC Recommendations, focus on Central Central Administration Response to PVC Resourcing\n(3.5) \nConsequences of \nstructural deficit \nin FoMD budget\n(a) Working with the provost and the \npresident, identify all opportunities for \ngenerating new revenues and re-directing \nexisting revenues to support recruitment of \nassistant professors and to sustain salary \nsupport for the researchers who contribute \nto high quality research \nWithin its sphere of influence the \nFoMD has implemented TRIP (an \naggressive retirement plan) and is \nevaluating faculty endowments and \nallocating CRC's, to improve faculty \nrenewal. The FoMD is also working \nwith the provost on renewal funding \nfor assistant professors, and with AIHS \non a new investigator program. Finally, \nthe FoMD is seeking replacement \nfunding on secondments. Using the \nabove approach we anticipate 10 \nnew assistant professor positions will \nbe filled in 2016-2017.\nDean, Vice Dean \nResearch and COO\nSix months \nand one year\n(c) New revenues and redirection of \nexisting revenues are necessary to \nempower the FoMD department chairs to \nrenew and stabilize the existing research \nfaculty complement. Review by the \nprovost of the current university budget \nallocation to the FoMD and its utilization \nfor faculty salary support will be very \nimportant \nIt makes sense to separate the natural renewal from the \nAHFMR legacy issues.  The data in the PVC report clearly \nshows that a significant backlog in renewal has occurred due \nmainly to the AHFMR funding issue.  As tenure track positions \nhave been freed up, they have been used to fund the AHFMR \nstaff rather than to renew the faculty with early career \nappointments.  There are therefore two backlogs: (1) the \nAHFMR staff  (2) the backlog of early career staff going back \nabout 5 years.  It is good to see that the TRIP strategy is \nachieving its goal of starting the renewal of early career staff.  \nCentral administration will work with the faculty and engage \nwith the provincial government to find solutions to the \nAHFMR funding challenges. \nThe FoMD has limted resources to \nfund new faculty positions. Currently \n70 per cent of its faculty salary are \nsoft funded, which typically comes \nwith restrictions on the type of \npositions funded. For 2016-2017 the \nfollowing resources have been found: \n2 x CRC + $1 M Provost + 5 x TRIP. We \nanticipate 10 new assistant \nprofessors will be hired in 2016-17. \nTo bring the faculty back to viable \nstatus and to cover AHFMR faculty, \n30 new faculty positions are required. \n(3.5) \nConsequences of \nstructural deficit \nin FoMD budget\n(b) Stop referring to the AHFMR funded \nfaculty as a separate group and incorporate \nthem into the department and research \ninstitute cohort of “funded faculty” \nCompleted. We no longer refer to \n'AHFMR faculty' distictly . Efforts to \naddress AFHMR funding gap have \nbeen ongoing. A solution has been \ncrafted up until 2021; however, after \nthat point there is no funding for \napproximately 30 AHFMR-faculty \nmembers.  \nDean and COO\nImmediately \nand two \nyears\n(c) Review by the provost of the current \nuniversity budget allocation to the FoMD \nand its utilization for faculty salary \nsupport will be very important \nPlease see response above.\nTo bring the faculty back to viable \nstatus and to cover AHFMR faculty, \n30 new faculty positions are \nrequired.\n(3.6) measuring \nresearch \nperformance  \n(c) Create a new framework for measuring \nresearch performance using feasible \nindicators relevant to all academic units and \nthe FoMD as a whole \nThe FoMD is currently revising its FEC \ncriteria for research and education \nusing a matrix approach.

We are \ncurrently developing a governance \nmodel for FoMD institutes and a \nshared location. Recruitment of new \nassistant professors will be aligned to \ninstitutes as well as to departments. \nThis is a fundamental shift in philosphy \nfor the faculty.\nVice-Dean, Research\nSix months to \nthree years\nCentral administration supports the implementation of the \nnew structures in FoMD in principle and looks forward to \nbeing engaged in further discussion as details emerge in the \ncoming months.  \nThe FoMD has the internal resources \nto effect this recommendation of \ndeveloping institutes, setting a \ngovernance model and developing a \nreturn on investment criteria. Central \nsupport will be required for this \nlinked department and institute \nmodel.  \n(3.4) Partnering \nfor successful \nrenewal of \nresearch\n(f) Identify those research leaders who are \nable and willing to lead new “big science” \ninitiatives.  In collaboration with the \nUniversity's Office of Research, provide \nthem with the “research business support” \nnecessary to prepare high quality, \ncompetitive applications. Many of these \napplications require matched funding (CFI, \nSPOR, CECR, Genome Canada, etc.) which \nnecessitates further support from the \nUniversity, the FoMD, and their \nAdvancement teams \nThe FoMD is currently developing and \nfunding a research grant business \nservices role, to identify, initiate and \nassist in the application of the large \nmultidisciplinary grants. In addition, \nwe are working to secure a stable fund \nfor matching funding. The HR change \nprocess to enable this \nrecommendation has been initiated. \nAim to open a future research \nfaciliation office.\nVice-Dean, Research One year\n(f) Facilitation and advice from the \npresident, and support from the central U \nof A Office of Research to provide \n“research business support” will be critical \nfor successful “big science” applications in \nthe field of health and biomedical \nresearch\n(g) Coordination and collaboration with \ncentral U of A Advancement and \ncampaign infrastructure support will be \nnecessary for the FoMD to achieve their \nfundraising goals and the new revenues \nfor improved research performance and \nimpact\nThe offices of the Provost and the VP (Research) have \nlaunched a signature areas identification process at the \nUniversity, as identified in the new strategic plan For the \nPublic Good . The objective is to build a portfolio of signature \nresearch and teaching areas where the University of Alberta \nis or will be recognized as a global leader. Through this \nprocess, the Faculties will have the opportunity to develop \nmultidisciplinary proposals for institutional areas and the \nFaculty of Medicine and Dentistry should consider how its \nwork in health and biomedical research feeds into that \nprocess.  \nThe VP (Research) and Provost are prepared to collaborate \nwith FoMD on the deployment of Faculty-based research \nsupport structures. \nFoMD has dedicated resources to hire \n(1) research facilitator. \nAdditional resources are required to \nhire (3) additional research grant \nbusiness support officers. In \naddition, matching funds are \nrequired to ensure national and \ninternational competativeness for \n\"big science\" inititiatives. \nItem 5 - page 5\nFaculty of Medicine Dentistry Response\n2016 President's Visiting Committee Report\nVersion 5 September 12, 2016 3 of 5\nFOMD Response To PVC Accountable Lead Timeline PVC Recommendations, focus on Central Central Administration Response to PVC Resourcing\nKey Finding\nCentral Administration Action ItemsFoMD Action Items \nPVC Recommendations, focus of FoMD\n(3.3) AHS and AI \nare ready to \npartner in \nresearch \n(3.4) Partnering \nfor successful \nrenewal of \nresearch\n(g) Working closely with counterparts at the \nUniversity of Calgary, identify specific \ntactics to establish strategic partnerships \nwith AHS to more effectively plan and \nadvocate for enhanced research investment \nfrom AI and the Government of Alberta.  \nThis may require activation of an effective \nAlberta Academic Health Science Network \nThe dean has initiated revival of the \nAcademic Health Network and \nCommittee of Academic Medicine \nwith the University of Calgary and \nthe G o A .

The data in the PVC report clearly \nshows that a significant backlog in renewal has occurred due \nmainly to the AHFMR funding issue.  As tenure track positions \nhave been freed up, they have been used to fund the AHFMR \nstaff rather than to renew the faculty with early career \nappointments.  There are therefore two backlogs: (1) the \nAHFMR staff  (2) the backlog of early career staff going back \nabout 5 years.  It is good to see that the TRIP strategy is \nachieving its goal of starting the renewal of early career staff.  \nCentral administration will work with the faculty and engage \nwith the provincial government to find solutions to the \nAHFMR funding challenges. \nThe FoMD has limted resources to \nfund new faculty positions.

ASSESSMENT ..................................................................................................................37 \nPage | 3  \n1. INTRODUCTION \nAs the leading university within Alberta, and a globally-ranked university among the Top 5 in \nCanada1, the University of Alberta is focused on attracting and recruiting exceptional students \nfrom across the country. Our current state recruitment strategy includes a heavy emphasis of \nrecruitment efforts and resources within Alberta, with a limited out-of-province focus within areas \nof British Columbia, Ontario, Saskatchewan, and the Northwest Territories. \nMaintaining a strong foothold with prospective students and stakeholders in our home province \nis critical to ensure that we are delivering on our promise to serve Albertans. At this time, \napproximately 74% of our applicants are applying from within Alberta2, making an Alberta-\nspecific recruitment strategy, comprised of multiple touch-points, a critical effort expended in \norder to recruit and retain our best and brightest students. Recruitment of Alberta students \nrequires a unique and tailored, multi-faceted approach to ensure that top students choose to \nstay in their home province.  \nNot only has the creation of additional degree granting institutions within Alberta increased local \ncompetition for high school students, but the strong reputation of Alberta’s standardized K-12 \ncurriculum and the competitive landscape for prospective students across Canada3 have \nresulted in increased competition with our out-of-province post-secondary competitors. It is now \nmore important than ever to ensure that we continue to maintain our robust and dedicated \nrecruitment focus in Alberta in order to nurture the strong, well established relationships we \nhave built with prospective students, parents, and counsellors from within the province. \nAt the same time, fewer than one in ten of our undergraduate students currently come from \noutside Alberta, undermining the institutional diversity that is a hallmark of any great university \nand a key building block of both reputation and student experience. Our goal is to ensure that all \nUniversity of Alberta students have a chance to interact and study with the best and brightest \nfrom across Canada. Furthering our efforts, in support of the goals set forth in the University’s \nInstitutional Strategic Plan (ISP), the Undergraduate National Recruitment Strategy will work to \nexpand out-of-province undergraduate enrolment with the intention of increasing the overall \nproportion of high-achieving students, as well as increasing the number of applicants who \npresent admission averages above the mean competitive average for their faculty. These \ninitiatives will be additive to the expansive and critically important recruitment initiatives already \nin place within our Alberta market. This strategy is led by the Office of the Registrar and will be \nimplemented in collaboration with faculty stakeholders and multiple campus partners. \nOur primary target audiences both inside and outside of the province will include high-achieving \nand above-competitive-average high school students, with additional emphasis on recruiting \nAboriginal students, students studying enriched curricula such as the Advanced Placement (AP) \nand International Baccalaureate (IB) programs, transfer students, international students already \n1 As per the 2015 QS World University Rankings, and the 2015 Maclean's University Rankings \n2 University of Alberta Annual Report of Enrolment 2015/16, page 24. \n3 Annual Demographic Estimates: Canada, Provinces and Territories. Statistics Canada, 2014. \nhttp://www.topuniversities.com/university-rankings/university-subject-rankings/2015/education-training#sorting=rank+region=+country=+faculty=+stars=false+search=\nhttp://www.macleans.ca/education/unirankings/2015-university-rankings-medical-doctoral/\nhttp://www.statcan.gc.ca/pub/91-215-x/91-215-x2015000-eng.pdf\nPage | 4  \nin Canada (Maple Leaf), and students from rural communities. Students studying in \nFrancophone and French immersion schools will also be a priority focus.  \nA number of region-specific initiatives in urban centres outside of Alberta, as well as select rural \ncommunities, reflect a targeted approach to prospective student recruitment by province, based \non the needs, motivators, influencers, and opportunities in each region. Influencers, such as \nhigh school counsellors and parents, will also be targeted. As we increase our activities in these \nmarkets, we will be flexible and adapt tactics as target audiences respond. \nSome of the proposed tactics in this strategy can be implemented immediately and will require \nminimal resources; others are multi-year and require significant investment. Several are region \nspecific, but most are broad and apply to all national markets. All tactics will benefit from \ndeliberate collaboration between central units and faculties. \nUndergraduate recruitment at the University of Alberta is a decentralized function, with \nrecruitment staff, strategies, and materials existing in central units such as the Office of the \nRegistrar, as well as within direct-entry faculties and Residence Services. Crucial to the success \nof this plan is ensuring we have effective coordination between all teams. Groups such as the \nRecruitment Network, the Advisory Committee on Enrolment Management (ACEM), as well as \nstrong relationships between and among the faculties and the Registrar’s Office are critical. In \naddition, the appropriate infrastructure, processes, and policies are needed to support \nprospective students in their admission journey. \nAs our various campuses have unique prospective student markets, recruitment for Augustana \nCampus and Campus Saint-Jean will require tailored approaches. Recruitment activities for \nthese campuses will continue to require campus-specific investments of time and resources at \nthe faculty level, as well as in collaboration with central units. \nBuilding the profile and awareness of the University of Alberta as a Top 5 comprehensive and \nresearch-intensive university, particularly in out-of-province markets, will be necessary to \nincrease both familiarity and favourability towards the institution. A national University \nAwareness campaign, led by University Relations, will be required. Materials and messages \noutside of Alberta will need to speak to a larger national audience, and include a positive identity \nfor Edmonton, for Alberta, as well as for Camrose as it relates to promotion of Augustana \nCampus.  \nOptimizing the use of technology for the purpose of broader accessibility and reputation building \namong prospective students and their influencers is critical. Prospective high school students \nare Generation Z – while printed materials are still in demand, prospective students have a clear \nexpectation that they can engage and learn more about universities online. \nCultivating a network of front line advocates, such as high school counsellors and alumni, allows \nus to expand our reach through targeted stewardship and engagement. Current University of \nAlberta students provide a unique recruitment asset that operates from a peer-to-peer \nperspective. And providing prospective students, and their influencers, with the opportunity to \nexperience all of our campus options for themselves provides an avenue to envision themselves \nas a part of the university community. \nPage | 5  \nAll students have non-negotiable needs that must be met in order to study at a post-secondary \ninstitution. Out-of-province students have the additional costs of moving, so a factor in their \ndecision is having access to adequate funding to offset additional study costs incurred by being \nfurther away from home. Our ability to meet this need and increase out-of-province enrolment \nwill rely on the implementation of the Undergraduate Financial Five strategy, which addresses \ngaps in current financial supports. Although the establishment of new needs-based bursary \nprogramming will initially focus on increasing access for incoming Alberta students, \nconsideration of possible expansion to include out-of-province students in future years will be \nrequired.  \nResidence Services is a key campus partner when implementing this recruitment strategy. \nMany of our Alberta, as well as all of our out-of-province, students will need to move away from \nhome in order to attend the University of Alberta and we want to ensure that we provide them \nwith residence options that will allow them to have an exceptional, safe, and welcoming \nexperience. \nYielding top prospective students from Alberta and out-of-province will also take coordinated \nefforts across central units and faculties to ensure a smooth admission process. Delivery of the \nAutomatic Admission Evaluation functionality within our admissions system will mean faster \nprocessing, efficiently moving applicants through the recruitment funnel. Ensuring that we audit \nout-of-province courses to confirm that we are accepting the appropriate academic subjects will \nalso be key, allowing us to increase eligibility for these students. \nDevelopment of this strategy has followed a highly consultative and collaborative process which \nwill continue through implementation. As we move forward with the recommendations and \ninitiatives outlined, close attention to both Alberta and out-of-province enrolment data, such as \napplicant numbers and yield, will be required. In addition, we will need to ensure diligence in \ncapturing prospective student data at events to engage, gauge effectiveness of initiatives, and \nmonitor their progress throughout the enrolment cycle. \n2. RATIONALE FOR STRATEGY \nSupporting the goals set forth in the Institutional Strategic Plan (ISP)4, the Office of the \nRegistrar, in collaboration with faculty stakeholders and partners, has developed this \nUndergraduate National Recruitment Strategy. Building on the existing strengths of a robust \nAlberta-based recruitment strategy, we are focused on expanding initiatives outside the \nprovince, driving the University of Alberta towards achieving its institutional goal of “building a \ndiverse, inclusive community of exceptional students, faculty, and staff from Alberta, Canada, \nand the world”. This strategy is the tactically focused extension of the Undergraduate (Out-of-\nProvince) National Recruitment Strategy Discussion Paper circulated in November 2015. \nAt the highest level, this strategy is focused on drawing a greater proportion of high-achieving \nstudents who typically present overall averages in the range of 90%+, as well as increasing the \nnumber of applicants to faculties who present admission averages above the mean competitive \n4 Page 5 of the draft University of Alberta Institutional Strategic Plan, March 2016 \nPage | 6  \naverage. The overarching goal is to ensure that all University of Alberta students have a chance \nto interact and study with the best and brightest from Alberta, as well as from across Canada. \nWhile Alberta high school students will remain a critical focus of our recruitment efforts, our \nprimary audiences outside the province will include high-achieving high school students \ngenerally, with additional emphasis on recruiting Aboriginal students, students studying enriched \ncurricula such as the Advanced Placement and International Baccalaureate programs, transfer \nstudents, international students already in Canada (Maple Leaf), and students from rural \ncommunities. Students studying in Francophone or French immersion schools will also be a \nfocus. \nThe overarching objectives for this strategy are to: \n1. Provide exceptional service in target markets to attract and retain high-achieving and eligible \nhigh school students. \n2. Enhance e-recruitment endeavours and leverage new technology for the purpose of broader \naccessibility and reputation building. \n3. Leverage resources and expertise through collaboration with key on-campus stakeholders. \n4. Cultivate a network of advocates that allow us to expand our reach through targeted \nstewardship and engagement. \n5. Build awareness and reputation through the creation of a coordinated University Awareness \nstrategy.  \nThis strategy has been developed in collaboration and consultation with the President and \nProvost, direct-entry faculties from across our campuses, University Relations, Marketing and \nCommunications, Vancouver and Toronto-based market advisory groups, and the \nUndergraduate National Recruitment Steering Committee. Continued collaboration between \ncentral and faculty units, including Residence Services, will be imperative to the successful \nincreased recruitment of out-of-province undergraduate students.  \nBuilding from the Institutional Strategic Plan5 (ISP), this strategy has been structured to address \nall five goals: \n○ BUILD a diverse, inclusive community of exceptional undergraduate students from \nEdmonton, Alberta, Canada, and the world. \n○ EXPERIENCE diverse and rewarding learning opportunities that inspire us, nurture our \ntalents, expand our knowledge and skills, and enable our success.  \n○ EXCEL as individuals, and together, sustain a culture that fosters and champions \ndistinction and distinctiveness in teaching, learning, research, and service.  \n○ ENGAGE communities across our campuses, the province, Canada, and the world to \ncreate reciprocal, mutually beneficial learning experiences, research projects, \npartnerships, and collaborations. \n○ SUSTAIN our people, our work, and the environment by attracting and stewarding the \nresources we need to deliver excellence to the benefit of all Albertans.  \n5 Page 5 of the draft University of Alberta Institutional Strategic Plan, March 2016 \nPage | 7  \nIn order to effectively support these goals and objectives we will capitalize on our strengths as a \ncomprehensive, research-intensive, multi-campus university, offering top-quality education in a \nwide variety of programs, with unique opportunities for students who choose to study in French \nor those who want to study at a small liberal arts campus. We will also develop and implement \nan undergraduate recruitment strategy to attract top Aboriginal students.  \nIt is critical that the institution has a core focus on institutional branding; this focus would \nunderpin national recruitment efforts just as those efforts would work in concert with branding \nefforts. Improved institutional branding will help raise awareness of the University of Alberta as a \nTop 5 national university that competes at the highest levels. Prospective students need to hear \nthe University story in order to realize the opportunities that are available to them. \nAs an institution, central units will work collaboratively with faculty partners to align our initiatives \nso that we can build our institutional brand, familiarity, and recognisability as a collective whole. \nBy pursuing a coordinated, strategic approach to national recruitment, we have the opportunity \nto realize the goals set forth in the ISP.  \n3. UNDERSTANDING THE STAGES OF RECRUITMENT \nAs we shift into the discussion of strategy-specific initiatives, first we will give a brief overview of \nthe basic stages of the recruitment cycle. The traditional enrolment funnel6 used in recruitment \nfocuses on four distinct stages with the end goal of enrolment.  \nAt the widest point of the funnel, we focus on engaging Prospects with the intention of \nincreasing general knowledge and awareness of the University, program options, the City of \n6 https://www.researchgate.net/figure/273477795_fig1_Figure-1-The-Traditional-Enrollment-Funnel \nPage | 8  \nEdmonton, and so on. Prospect initiatives may include things such as presence at education \nfairs, prospective student handbooks, and presentations in high schools.  \nThe Inquiry stage is representative of the moment in which the prospective student shifts from \nsimply gathering information to engaging in an inquiry process to get further details. Inquiry \nfocused initiatives would include things such as campus visits, online chat rooms, advising \nsessions, providing transfer credit estimates for those already studying at a post-secondary \ninstitution, and specialized recruitment events. Prospective students are able to sign up for \ncommunications notifying them of future events in their area, and we are able to use this \ninformation to track their university interactions, as well as application status, using a \nProspective Student Database. This allows us to maintain engagement with these students \nthroughout the cycle, and encourage advancement to the narrowing sections of the funnel.  \nThe Applicant stage signals that a student is more serious about their potential to enrol at the \nuniversity and has decided to submit their application for admission. To support this stage, \nrecruitment initiatives may include application and on-site admission workshops in schools \nand/or regions, providing information on our admission criteria, and supporting applicants in \nunderstanding what further steps are required in order to receive their admission offer. \nThe Admit stage focuses on assessing incoming applications and providing eligible students \nwith an admission offer. To support this stage, recruitment initiatives may include detailed \nadvising that includes communications regarding their application status, steps on how to \nupdate courses and marks once new information that can be used for admission is available, \ndirections on how to submit required transcripts, information on important deadlines such as \nadmission offer acceptance, and answering admission inquiries from students via email, phone, \nand in-person advising.  \nThe final stage, Enrolled, becomes very focused on yield and conversion activities, with the \nprimary goal of converting admitted applicants to enrolled (i.e. offer is accepted and they have \nregistered in courses). This stage is heavily focused on initiatives such as competitive \nscholarship offers, peer mentorship programs (i.e. current student partnered with admitted \nstudent), special events celebrating their offer of admission and final steps to become a \nuniversity student, course registration workshops in schools and/or regions, and \ncommunications-focused yield campaigns delivering messaging that gears admits towards \nseeing themselves as part of the University of Alberta story. Once students transition into the \nUniversity as a current student, they begin a new phase in the strategic enrolment cycle that \nincludes retention of current students, degree completion, and transition to alumni status. \nPage | 9  \n4. STRATEGY OVERVIEW  \nBuilding our national recruitment strategy initiatives and tactics on the basis of the traditional \nenrolment management funnel, outlined in Section 4, comes with the necessary steps of \nidentifying target numbers, target regions and audiences, as well as the needs, motivators, and \ninfluencers for those regions and audiences. Underpinning the success of any of our efforts will \nbe the branding and profile building of our institution in markets that are less familiar with our \nreputation, the securing of the necessary resources to mount a comprehensive campaign, and \nthe coordinated efforts of central and faculty units within a decentralized recruitment model. \nFor more than a hundred years, the University of Alberta has worked alongside the provincial \ngovernment to inspire Albertans and to forge a province that is vibrant and competitive across \nCanada, as well as around the world. As the destination of choice for hundreds of Alberta’s top \nhigh school students each year, we are committed to maintaining and enriching our connections \nto these students, as well as their influencers.  \nThe Alberta recruitment strategy has been well-established over the last 20 years, resulting in \nwell-founded relationships with high schools, high school counsellors, and exceptional \nrecruitment initiatives scheduled over the course of the recruitment cycle. Our in-province \nstrategy is supported by a combination of targeted in-person visits, special events, publications, \nand web-based initiatives, geographically tailored to fit the needs of each target audience.  \nAs we move towards expanding our out-of-province reach, we are able to maximize on the \nexperience, strengths, and expertise of our existing recruitment practice, customizing our \napproach to meet the needs and interests of particular areas, regions, and groups of \nprospective students. \nTarget Groups \nOur primary target audiences in all markets will include high-achieving and eligible high school \nstudents, with additional emphasis on recruiting Aboriginal students, students studying enriched \ncurricula such as the Advanced Placement and International Baccalaureate programs, transfer \nstudents, international students already in Canada (Maple Leaf), and students from rural \ncommunities. Students studying in Francophone and French immersion schools will also be a \npriority focus.  \nHigh School Students \nHigh school students are our primary focus of investment, both in terms of dollars and \nresources. Our focus has and will continue to be recruiting top students with a high school \naverage above 90%; however, within the province we also look to attract solid students who \nmeet the competitive average requirements, ensuring that we remain first and foremost \naccessible to Albertans.  \nPage | 10  \nIn terms of how we approach high school students, we must consider that the majority of our \nprospective students are part of Generation Z, characterized by their lifelong exposure7 to \nadvanced technologies, their optimistic belief in their ability to change the world, their \nwillingness to embrace diversity, their desire to make a difference doing something meaningful, \nand the desire to ensure that they will get a return on dollar investment in their education. These \nwill be important factors in the consideration of our messaging and tactics, particularly with \nrespect to social media and recruitment publications. \nIn some out-of-province target regions, well-ranked private schools may also be considered. \nInternational Baccalaureate and Advanced Placement Students \nAlberta has a large number of schools offering enriched curricula, including the International \nBaccalaureate (IB) and Advanced Placement (AP) curriculums. Both of these programs are \ninternationally recognized, tend to attract high-achieving students, and create opportunities for \nhigh school students to engage in coursework that is, in some instances, equivalent to \nuniversity-level study (with some qualifying for transferable credit). Students who have studied \nin IB and AP programs are well-geared towards university studies and tend to perform well.  \nSchools offering IB and AP programs tend to be located in cities, with a significant concentration \nin Edmonton and Calgary. In markets that will be newer to us, we will look to schools offering \nthese types of programs as indicators of academic suitability, as well as building on our \nreputation as a university of choice for IB and AP students. \nFrench Immersion and Francophone Schools \nFrench immersion and Francophone schools are a niche market, creating an opportunity to \ncapture the attention of students with strong academic backgrounds who may wish to study in \nFrench (for their entire degree, for year one of their program, or even a few classes). Applicants \nfrom French Immersion and Francophone schools may choose to apply to study at Campus \nSaint-Jean (CSJ), in a program or Faculty that holds a partnership with CSJ (i.e. Education, \nbilingual Nursing program, etc.), or in an English instruction faculty knowing that they may have \noptions to take a handful of courses through FSJ that would be taught in French.  \nBoth Edmonton and Calgary, as well as select schools in other cities within Alberta, have a \nlarge number of these schools, many of which we have been working closely with for years. We \nhave identified, though, that the concentration of schools within Calgary, combined with the fact \nthat there are no French-language post-secondary options within the Calgary area, makes this \nregion an area of specific interest for further expansion of efforts.  \nOutside Alberta, leveraging the uniqueness of our French campus, as well as opportunities to \nlearn in French for a portion or all of their degree, may create opportunities to build interest not \nonly for these programs, but also at the institutional level. \n7 This is Gen Z booklet, http://ologie.com/gen-z/ \nhttp://ologie.com/gen-z/\nPage | 11  \nTransfer Students \nThe transfer system within the Campus Alberta system is strong and effective. In addition to the \ncollaborative programs already in place in faculties such as Education and Nursing, there is \nsubstantial opportunity for students to transfer to the University of Alberta after one to two years \nof study (for many programs), and in some instances in the latter years or after completion of \ntheir degree. \nWithin Alberta, a number of our faculties have strong connections with other Alberta post-\nsecondary institutions, particularly with colleges and with specific transfer program advisors. \nOverall, our faculties play the primary role in transfer-focused recruitment initiatives due to the \nspecific transfer credit considerations for these prospective students.  \nTransfer students play a large role in meeting University enrolment targets. While there is \nworthy potential in exploring post-secondary transfer student recruitment opportunities outside \nof Alberta, due to the specific transfer credit considerations these prospects have as priority \nfactors in their decision making, faculties need to play a large role in transfer-focused \nrecruitment initiatives. A more detailed explanation to the approach for transfer credit \nrecruitment will be discussed in Section 5.1 Overarching Initiatives. \nAboriginal Students \nAs per the draft Institutional Strategic Plan, an Indigenous Strategic Plan will be developed \nunder the leadership of the Provost’s Office. This plan will capture our current state Aboriginal \nStudent recruitment initiatives, as well as an expanded scope for new initiatives within and \noutside of Alberta.  \nParticular efforts on attracting and recruiting students who identify as Aboriginal is a priority, and \nrequires a tailored approach, such as an emphasis on connecting with youth prior to high \nschool. As stated in the ISP, we need to, “develop and implement an undergraduate and \ngraduate recruitment and retention strategy to attract top Indigenous students.”8  \nWhile many of the tactics and initiatives planned for out-of-province recruitment will undoubtedly \napply and appeal to Aboriginal students in the markets we are targeting in this strategy, \nparticularly in British Columbia, Saskatchewan, Manitoba, and the North, we must go further in \norder to acknowledge the needs, motivators, and influencers that will best support the \nsuccessful recruitment and retention of Aboriginal students. This will include leveraging unique \nprograms and services, such as the Faculty of Native Studies, the Transition Year Program, and \nthe Aboriginal Student Services Centre.   \n8 Page 7 of the draft University of Alberta Institutional Strategic Plan, March 2016 \nPage | 12  \nMaple Leaf (International Students already in Canada) \nThe University’s second largest source country for international undergraduate student \nenrolment is Canada – our Maple Leaf students. While some Maple Leaf applicants are coming \nfrom post-secondary institutions across Canada, many of these students are those who have \ncome to Canada to complete high school, the majority planning to continue their post-secondary \nstudies within Canada. Over the years we have developed strong connections with schools, as \nwell as school districts, which have large numbers of international students.  \nThese students often look for top-ranking universities that offer degrees that are recognized and \nrespected internationally, making branding and awareness efforts a critical need in these \nmarkets.  \nRural Students \nRecruitment of rural students is an important focus for the institution generally and builds on the \nISP goal of diversity. In order to grow the number of highly qualified rural students, we need to \nincrease the perception of accessibility and the strength of our University community for rural \ncommunities and schools, both within Alberta and out-of-province. \nWithin Alberta, rural communities are a high priority to Augustana Campus, as well as other \nfaculties. Some of our rural prospective students will consider moving to an urban centre directly \nafter high school to start at the University of Alberta in year one, where others may choose to \nmove to a regional college for one or two years as part of a collaborative or transfer program. \nParents \nDirectly linked to initiatives targeted at students, the needs, motivators, and influencing potential \nof parents will be factored into our tactics. Parents are often looking for detailed information on \ninstitutional reputation, program quality, costs, scholarships, housing, safety, services, and \nsupports. While these varying pieces are of interest to many parents, generally, the further away \nfrom Alberta a prospective student currently lives, there are greater parental concerns and \ncareful consideration of suitability and fit. \nHigh School Counsellors \nDeveloping strong and sustained relationships with counsellors in target region high schools will \nbe a particular focus within our strategy. They have the potential to raise awareness of the \nUniversity of Alberta based on their opinion and experience with our university and serve as the \nconstant within markets in which we will likely only visit two or three times within a recruitment \ncycle.  \nPage | 13  \nTeacher Alumni Working in Schools in Target Regions \nSimilar to the effectiveness of engaging counsellors, University alumni working as teachers are \nalso positioned to share their experiences with students with whom they are likely to have a \nmore frequent and involved relationship. Enthusiastic alumni can share their story, helping \nprospective students see themselves within our community throughout the recruitment process.  \nAfter identifying who these alumni are and where they are located, we can request their support \nby letting them know we will be visiting their region, inviting their support in stimulating interest \nwith their students, and supplying them with promotional items that they can place in their \nclassrooms to build institutional branding and awareness. \n5. FOCUS: ALBERTA  \nTarget Capacity  \nOur recruitment efforts within Alberta current state are already yielding exceptional results, with \n74% of our applicants (approximately 23,000) applying from within the province. While \ncontinuing to provide access to qualified Albertan students as a priority applicant group, we will \nalso focus on attracting a larger share of Alberta’s top students, namely those who have \nachieved an overall academic average in the range of 90%+. Competitor universities from other \nprovinces recruit in Alberta specifically to pursue these same students, and it therefore makes \nsense for Alberta as a province (and for UAlberta as a university) to retain as many of these \nbright minds as possible, at least for their post-secondary studies.   Recognizing the diversity of \nour programs and our commitment to access for Albertans, our strategy will continue to also \nfocus on attracting those applicants who meet, or exceed, the competitive admission averages \nto all programs. This approach ensures that we are meeting the diverse enrolment needs of all \nof our faculties. \nTarget Regions \nThis strategy will focus continued efforts in the following regions: \n• Edmonton and Surrounding Areas: With the increased number of post-secondary \ncompetitor options in Edmonton, there is still room to grow and deepen our penetration \nof the Edmonton and surrounding areas market. We will continue to strengthen our ties \nwith high schools, as well as transfer/upgrading institutions, to ensure the continued flow \nof high achieving students to the university. \n• Calgary: The Calgary region has become increasingly competitive over the last 5-10 \nyears, with an increased number of out-of-province institutions actively recruiting local \nstudents. As a result, we must invest additional efforts in this market to keep these \nstudents in Alberta. \n• Small Cities in Alberta: Ensuring that UAlberta is presented as an accessible and \nattainable institution of choice to students in small cities and rural communities is a \npriority. The prevalence of transfer institutions in small cities requires that we work \ntogether to establish the best-fit post-secondary pathway for students, and provide \nstudents with the appropriate information to select their institution of choice. The bulk of \nPage | 14  \nresources will be focused on Red Deer, Fort McMurray, and Grande Prairie, as well as \nsmaller cities within Southern Alberta, such as Medicine Hat and Lethbridge. \n• Rural Communities: Understanding that rural students may have fewer opportunities to \nexplore post-secondary options due to proximity, it is important that we service these \ncommunities to nurture the strong ties created historically with these communities, \nincrease awareness of the opportunities available at UAlberta, and promote accessibility.  \n6. FOCUS: OUT-OF-PROVINCE  \nTarget Capacity  \nWith a goal of recruiting high-achieving undergraduate students, we will focus on increasing the \nproportion of out-of-province applicants who have achieved an overall academic average in the \nrange of 90%+. This serves to increase the quality of students on our campus and also \nimproves the quality of educational experience for all of our students as they learn among peers \nwho bring a strong academic track record.  \nRecognizing the diversity of our programs, current-state enrolment numbers across faculties, \nand existing entrance averages, this strategy will focus not only on seeking high-achieving \nstudents, but also on attracting those applicants who will present an admission average that is \nat least three to five percent higher than the mean competitive average for the faculty they have \napplied to. While applicants will continue to be admitted based on a faculty’s competitive \naverage, the goal will be to recruit applicants with higher-than-competitive averages. For \nexample, if a faculty has a mean competitive average of XX%, the goal will be to recruit out-of-\nprovince students who present admission averages in the range of XX +3% to +5%. This \napproach ensures that we are meeting the diverse enrolment needs of all of our faculties. \nApproach \nWe will implement a multi-year strategy and phased approach in order to ensure success. \nGeneral standards within recruitment suggest that it can take up to three years to create impact \nwithin a new market, necessitating multi-year strategies with phased measures of success. It \nwill take time, significant investment, and a coordinated approach by University Relations, \nNational Recruitment, faculties, and other campus partners, to move from low out-of-province \nawareness to high levels of familiarity and favourability that will result in action, such as applying \nand ultimately enrolling.  \nEach of the next four intake cycles will have a particular area of focus: \nPage | 15  \nTarget Regions \nTarget regions will predominantly include large urban centres in out-of-province markets, as well \nas high potential pockets in rural communities. As part of the consultation process with \nUniversity faculties and units, we examined all provinces and territories in Canada to assess \npotential and suitability. While our recruitment initiatives will have some amount of reach in all \nareas of Canada through our website and marketing materials, there are a number of regions \nthat have been specifically identified as having higher potential to attract prospective students or \nare markets that would yield more students if our institutional awareness became more familiar \nand favourable. Within each region we have examined the needs, motivators, and influencers \nfor prospective students (discussed further below), which informs our potential to yield these \nprospects. A detailed outline of the prioritized regions selected will be covered in Section 8.3, \nRegion-Specific Initiatives: Out-of-Province. \n7. APPROACH \nNeeds/Motivators/Influencers \nWhile developing the out-of-province component of this strategy, our approach in the working \nsessions was to examine all of our market opportunities in terms of the relevant needs, \nmotivators, and influencers at play in each market. These have informed not only the choice of \ntarget regions, but also the specific tactics, messaging, and University story each market needs \nin order to yield prospective students. \nFrom a series of prospective student surveys done with high school students from across \nCanada, as well as with University prospective students specifically, we know that the three \nprimary factors that influence the decision to attend the University of Alberta include our \nreputation, location, and offering their program of choice9. We know the same three factors, in \nslightly different order, impact a prospective student’s decision to decline an admission offer. \nNeeds \n“Needs” are non-negotiable and must be met to make out-of-province study possible. They may \ninclude things such as eligibility to enrol in their primary program of choice, knowledge of \ntransfer credit potential (for those already in post-secondary studies), adequate funding to offset \nany potential additional study costs being further away from home, secured quality housing \noptions, and having a sense of community in the city to which they plan to relocate.   \nExamples of region-specific needs that were identified in the working sessions include: \n● Prospective students coming from a further distance will have (or believe they will have) \nhigher costs associated with relocating to Alberta as compared to staying in their home \nprovince or a neighbouring province/territory. Attracting prospects from these markets may \ninclude offering additional new student funding to help offset some of these costs. \n9 Page 3, Prospective Student Decision Making Surveys Summary \nPage | 16  \n● Prospective students who do not have reasonably easy access to our campuses may not \nhave the benefit of exploring our campus(es) and/or city(ies). We will need to ensure that our \nonline presence will meet their needs and provide the information/experience out-of-province \nstudents are looking for in order to help them make us their university of choice.  \nMotivators \nMotivators point to those things that would motivate a student to consider studying at the \nUniversity of Alberta. These may include scholarships, unique facilities or programs, or our \nreputation as a top institution. Other motivating factors might include the desire to explore a new \npart of Canada and/or travel further away from home to have a more independent experience. \nExamples of region-specific motivators that were identified in the working sessions include:  \n● Prospective students who are interested in a specific program, experience, or reputational \nranking, such as studying on a French campus, gaining admission to a Nursing program that \nranks fourth in the world10, or studying at an accredited Business school with an extensive \nlist of majors, will be motivated to consider the University based on program fit, quality, and \navailability at other schools. \n● Prospective students coming from regions that have a strong sense of pride and community \nmay be more motivated to consider the University of Alberta if they can see themselves as \npart of our community before making their choice. Prospective students from Saskatchewan, \nfor example, may have a strong sense of pride associated with their home province (as we \nsee, for example, in the strong affiliation to their provincial football team). Creating \nopportunities for Saskatchewan prospective students to become part of the University \ncommunity, possibly by matching them with current students also from Saskatchewan \nthrough a mentorship program, may serve to motivate applicants to see themselves on our \ncampus through shared “community” connections. \nOut-of-province influencers \nInfluencers are those factors and people that will support a prospective student in making their \ndecision. Influencers could include counsellors and teachers, influential, regional, and \nfamily/familiar alumni, and current students from the home region (i.e. university mentor that \nreaches out to applicant). Influence can also come in the form of connection with high-level \nuniversity officials (i.e. President’s reception in Toronto), well-spoken university recruiters, and \nexceptional front line staff in service units across campus(es) who applicants will connect with \nwhen they reach out for support. \nExamples of initiatives targeting influencers identified in the working sessions include: \n● High School Counsellors have the potential to have significant influence over post-secondary \ndecision making, we have an opportunity to invite targeted out-of-province counsellors to \ncome to campus and spend a few days with us - introduce them to our university community, \nhave them experience our state-of-the-art facilities, explore Edmonton, and Alberta. They \ncan then take their first-hand experience back to future cohorts of prospective students. \n10 QS World University Rankings by Subject 2016 - Nursing  \nhttp://www.topuniversities.com/university-rankings/university-subject-rankings/2016/nursing#sorting=rank+region=+country=+faculty=+stars=false+search=\nPage | 17  \n● Alumni, whether prominent or passionate, can be extremely effective in creating a positive \nimpression of the university, especially when the prospect and alumnus are from the same \nhome region. There are opportunities for prospect involvement at alumni events already \noccurring in recruitment target regions, as well as engaging alumni in reaching out to \napplicants for yield purposes. \nBranding and Awareness \nBuilding the profile and awareness of the University of Alberta as a Top 5 comprehensive and \nresearch-intensive university in local, provincial, and out-of-province markets will increase both \nfamiliarity and favourability towards the institution and ultimately foster increases in enrolment.  \nThe University of Alberta 2014 Higher Education Reputation Syndicated Study, procured by \nUniversity Relations in Fall 2014, confirms that the level of awareness about the University is \nsignificantly lower in the rest of Canada relative to levels within Alberta11. This was further \nreflected in discussions with special advisory groups in Vancouver and Toronto (facilitated by \nUniversity Relations and in collaboration with the Office of the Registrar).  \nOur research and discussions further confirm that opinions about the overall reputation and \nacademic excellence are largely positive in Alberta, but lower for the rest of Canada. \nFortunately, few Canadians have a poor opinion of the University of Alberta; rather opinions are \ngenerally neutral, likely due to a lack of knowledge about the institution and/or our location. In \ncore reputational metrics identified in the Ipsos Reid Reputation Pyramid12, the University of \nAlberta rates lowest on favourability (20th) out of the Top 20 institutions.  \nIt will take time, significant new investment, and a coordinated approach by University Relations, \nNational Recruitment, faculties, and other University partners to move the out-of-province \nprospective student audience from a low level of awareness to high levels of familiarity and \nfavourability, supporting even the shorter term goal of engaging Prospects through to \nApplicants. The approaches that could be taken for a branding campaign are extensive and \ncould include print, radio, and other media campaigns, social media and web campaigns, and \nmore. \nAs we move forward into upcoming recruitment cycles, University Relations, Marketing and \nCommunications, and the Office of the Registrar (Communications and National Recruitment \nunits) will continue to work together to create a University Awareness campaign and will ensure \nthis critical base requirement is successful. \nLeveraging Location \nWhile distinct from the needs surrounding the branding of our institution, the location of our \ncampuses are key factors influencing prospective student decision making. As such, we will \nalso focus on creating a positive identity for Edmonton, as well as Alberta, when recruiting out-\n11 Page 5, University of Alberta 2014 Higher Education Reputation Syndicated Study \n12 Page 2, University of Alberta 2014 Higher Education Reputation Syndicated Study \nPage | 18  \nof-province. In addition, we need to ensure that we feature Camrose in all Augustana-specific \ncommunications. \nA key initiative to promote location is to create Edmonton-based recruitment materials, such as \nan Edmonton-specific handbook or banner displays, to be used at out-of-province recruitment \nevents.  \nAdditional examples of how we can profile the City of Edmonton to our best advantage include:  \n● developing a city of Edmonton feature page on recruitment focused web pages,  \n● including Edmonton information on University social media accounts,  \n● increasing the use of vibrant Edmonton photography,  \n● including an Edmonton Experience element to on-campus events,  \n● working in partnership with groups in Edmonton who are creating a vibrant, \nentrepreneurial image and message for our city (e.g. Make Something Edmonton, \n#YEGLongDay) \n● optimize search engine functionality to ensure University of Alberta information appears \nwhen searching for universities, Edmonton, and Alberta,  \n● position moving away from home and coming to Edmonton as an adventure/journey by \nsharing the stories of current students from similar regions, and \n● celebrate the four seasons within Alberta. \n8. INITIATIVES \nThe recommended initiatives in this section outline a targeted approach to prospective high \nschool student recruitment based on the needs, motivators, influencers, and barriers identified \nby the working groups, as well as the competitive landscape in these markets.  \nMarkets have been thoroughly researched and prioritized according to the following criteria: \n● high populations of target students, such as Aboriginal students, international students, \nrural students, and enriched curricula programs, \n● large populations of students who hold the potential to be academically admissible (i.e. \nhave access to the academic courses required to attend the University of Alberta), \n● well-founded relationships with Registrar’s Office recruiters, \n● pockets of applications already received from the region, indicating the existence of an \nawareness of the University of Alberta within the region/school, \n● regions that require high-achieving students to relocate if they are seeking a Top 5 \nuniversity experience, and \n● strong presence of enthusiastic and supportive University alumni. \nPage | 19  \n8.1 Initiatives for All Markets \nTo begin, we will look to several initiatives that are intended for all markets, developed with the \nneeds, motivators, and influencers of prospective high school students, as well as the \ncompetitive landscape, at top of mind. NOTE: order does not indicate priority. \nRecruitment Materials \nCommunication materials, such as the Undergraduate Viewbook, presentations, and other \ncollateral, will include inspiring and motivating photography and messaging, showcasing what it \nwill be like for prospective students to live in Edmonton, and be a University of Alberta student.  \nAs we engage out-of-province students, we will assess our key institutional and recruitment \nmessages to ensure that they are relevant to a larger national audience and address their \nspecific needs and motivators. \nAdditional materials that further speak to the differentiating needs of out-of-province students \ncan be created as needed such as province specific print materials, and province specific \npresentation messaging. Current materials, such as Yield Campaign Packages, will also include \nmessaging directed towards engaging out-of-province admitted students, and print quantities \nwill increase to support a wider national reach.  \nE-recruitment \nLeveraging technology for the purpose of broader accessibility and reputation building among \nprospective students and their influencers is critical. Our target audience in all markets is \nGeneration Z students, who have the expectation that they can engage and learn more about \nuniversities online and through various forms of media. This will also require optimizing e-\nrecruitment platforms for mobile use, which will require a substantial investment of both time \nand resources. \nE-Recruitment channels include our institutional and prospective student websites, along with \ntargeted email campaigns, blogs, and online chats. Social media is an important area of focus \nfor prospects, particularly for branding and in the narrower bands of the recruitment funnel, and \nmust be done using relevant tools with content that is developed specifically to engage their \ninterests.  \nOther innovative e-recruitment initiatives may include hosting an online Open House for \nstudents who are not able to easily visit in person, utilizing and expanding the University Virtual \nTour, hosting online presentations and workshops (both general and faculty-specific), as well as \ndeveloping an online video presence showcasing videos from current students, the City of \nEdmonton, and from across our campuses. \nPage | 20  \nCounsellor Engagement \nRelationship-building is an essential piece of a successful recruitment strategy, and is \nparticularly important within Alberta.  As the leading university within our province, counsellors \nexpect a high level of service for their students. Therefore, regular and ongoing engagement \nwith Alberta counsellor stakeholders is critical. Examples of existing and successful counsellor \ninitiatives within Alberta include: \n● hosting and/or attending regional counsellor events, \n● providing materials (e.g. publications, promotional items) to support their advising of \nstudents, as well as a monthly e-newsletter, \n● hosting online counsellor update events that focus on program highlights, significant \nchanges, and advising support for those who cannot attend in-person, and \n● having one-on-one meetings and counsellor roundtables to learn more about their high \nschool students and their individual needs. \nAs we consider our initiatives out-of-province, cultivating a network of front line advocates such \nas high school counsellors, allows us to expand our reach through targeted stewardship and \nengagement. High school counsellors have the potential to influence prospective students and \ntheir families, from introducing the University of Alberta as an option for study, to supporting the \ntransition from admitted applicant to enrolled student. They are also our local advocates in \ntarget high schools in which we will reasonably have only a handful of in-person touch points \nover the course of a recruitment cycle. \nEngaging counsellors on campus from our target regions outside Alberta is a critical tactic. \nMaking an investment to get them on our campus(es) for a few days, introducing them to our \ncommunity, showcasing our top-quality facilities, exploring Edmonton (and Camrose where \napplicable) and enjoying highlights of Alberta allows counsellors to experience first-hand the \nbenefits and highlights of our university that they can then take back to their high schools to \nshare with their students. \nAdditional examples of counsellor engagement initiatives include:  \n● leveraging connections with alumni teaching in high schools (both teachers and \ncounsellors), and \n● creating a Campus Saint-Jean specific counsellor e-newsletter to increase our reach in \nfrancophone schools across Canada.  \nCollege/Transfer Student Recruitment \nRecruitment of transfer students will require a highly coordinated effort between the Office of the \nRegistrar and faculties, each playing a unique role. The Registrar’s Office will play a \ncoordinating role, organizing visits and logistics, providing University promotional materials, and \npromoting the institution as a Top 5 university. Invested faculties will play a critical role in \nidentifying relevant institutions (based on the potential to admit students based on fit, quality, \nand transfer credit potential), assessing potential transfer credit to support prospects and \ninquiries focused on determining transfer credit potential, and collaborating among faculties to \nPage | 21  \ndevelop and maintain an out-of-province transfer guide. As there is varied interest by faculties \nsurrounding transfer student recruitment (with primary concerns tied to the demands of transfer \ncredit assessment), it is suggested that we begin by targeting four or five out-of-province \ntransfer institutions with those faculties who are invested, as well as initiate the development of \nan out-of-province transfer guide. \nCurrent Student Engagement  \nCurrent University students provide a unique recruitment asset that operates from a peer-to-\npeer perspective. These students have a voice and can offer perspectives that are often seen to \nbe genuine, “real,” and relevant to what a prospective student may perceive their experience will \nultimately be like. \nAt the institutional level, we already engage current students through our University \nAmbassador program and mentorship program volunteers situated in faculties. These current \nstudents energetically engage with prospective students through campus tours, presentations, \nmentorship pairings, and by sharing testimonials of their experiences. Building on these existing \nefforts, we will look for opportunities to have current students engage prospects in their home \ncommunities, especially those that are originally from a specific target region or high school. For \nexample, a current student returning to their home community for fall or spring Reading Week \ncould host a pizza lunch in their former high school and share their positive University of Alberta \nexperience with prospective students. \nWe will also identify and match current students from target regions/high schools to make \ncongratulatory phone calls to newly admitted students, increase the social media presence of \ncurrent student blogs and videos, and faculties may explore more formal peer mentorship \nopportunities to engage newly admitted students at the level of their academic program. \nOn-Campus Initiatives \nA campus experience, whether positive or negative, will greatly influence the final decision of a \nprospective student in terms of which institution they will attend. Providing prospective students, \nand their influencers, with the opportunity to experience all of our campus options for \nthemselves provides an avenue to envision themselves as a part of the University of Alberta \ncommunity.  \nIn addition to opportunities such as campus visits and tours, the university could host and \npartner with an existing major youth conference (e.g. Model United Nations Conference, or a \nnational mathematics competition) or a major Canadian athletics tournament, profiling the \nuniversity alongside externally organized events (hosted inside and outside Alberta). We could \nalso partner with units across campus(es) to host our own conference that is geared to the \ninterests of engaged youth, such as Inspiring Social Change, Globalization, or a leadership \nfocus in partnership with the Peter Lougheed Leadership College (PLLC). \nPage | 22  \nAdditional examples on on-campus initiatives include:  \n● expanding and customizing the Campus Visit Program, \n● extending Open House to a weekend event, \n● identifying exposure opportunities with youth already attending on-campus camps (e.g. \nsummer sport camps, DiscoverE Engineering camps, Philosophy camps such as \nEurekamp), \n● partnering with Edmonton-based youth conferences or events to draw event participants \nto our campus(es) as part of their conference program (e.g. group tours, topic-specific \nlectures with an engaging professor), \n● developing partnerships with travel companies (e.g. Red Arrow, Greyhound, Air Canada, \nand WestJet) to offer more affordable or subsidized travel options to bring prospective \nstudents to existing university events, and \n● partnering with Residence Services to provide an overnight experience for prospective \nstudents. \nStudent Financial Support Initiatives \nAccess to financial support is a significant factor in student post-secondary institution decision \nmaking13. In order to be competitive, financial support programs must address the needs of \nincoming students by providing comprehensive merit and need-based opportunities. \nTop Alberta students are highly sought after by both out-of-province and Alberta-based \ninstitutions. As such, the university offers awards for high achieving students, as well as \nstudents who excel in leadership. In addition to our awards program, the university will \nimplement a needs-based funding model for incoming Alberta students. This will maintain \naccess for eligible students who could not otherwise afford to attend UAlberta.  \nAs outlined in the Needs section above, out-of-province students have non-negotiable needs \nthat must be met in order to study away from home, such as having access to adequate funding \nto offset additional study costs incurred by being further away from home, whether perceived or \nreal.  \nOur ability to meet this need will rely on the implementation of the Undergraduate Student \nFinancial Support Strategy (the ‘Financial Five’, in consultation at time of writing), which \naddresses gaps in current financial supports. An example would be creating new merit-based \nscholarship opportunities for out-of-province target groups. Needs-based funding for out-of-\nprovince students may also be a possibility for future years and should be considered after the \ncurrent initiative to increase needs-based funding for Albertan students is achieved.  \nRegional working sessions recommended implementing a “Return Home” award that would \nallow out-of-province students to travel home in their first year of university. This would \ndemonstrate the importance of community to the university, and may diminish the cost-barrier \nfor these students to maintain connections with their families and communities while studying at \n13 studentawards inc 2011, Price of Knowledge 2004 \nhttp://www.heqco.ca/SiteCollectionDocuments/Suzanne%20Tyson_Student%20Attitudes%20Toward%20Higher%20Education.pdf\nhttps://qspace.library.queensu.ca/bitstream/1974/5782/1/Price_of_Knowledge-2004.pdf\nPage | 23  \nUniversity of Alberta. To leverage their experience, a social media campaign will be created to \nshowcase what students have done during their “trip home,” which can be highlighted in future \nrecruitment initiatives. \nOther initiatives for both Alberta and out-of-province students include establishing a promotional \nprogram that recognizes award recipients in their home communities and high schools, \nincreasing the value and number of renewable scholarships, streamlining award application \nprocesses by creating one application for all financial supports, and updating our website and \nonline presence to clearly provide prospective students with the information and tools they need \nto inform them of the financial support options. \nAlumni \nWe will engage high profile and/or enthusiastic alumni from across Canada to support both the \nprofile-building of the institution, as well as increasing interest in attending, and yielding eligible \napplicants. This approach we believe directly supports the Institutional Strategic Plan key \nstrategy towards building a sense of belonging among all members of the University community \nby, “identify(ing) and increase(ing) opportunities to engage alumni and volunteers as valued \nadvisors, mentors, volunteers, and interested constituents.”14  \nWorking with Alumni Relations through the Office of Advancement, we will look at existing \nalumni-hosted events to find opportunities to incorporate recruitment elements, as well as \nexplore ways to engage enthusiastic alumni living in target regions. Examples may include \nhaving alumni make congratulatory phone calls to newly admitted students in their home region, \ninviting high profile local alumni to recruitment events as keynote speakers, and inviting \nprospective students to appropriate alumni events to network with alumni. \nResidence \nResidence Services will be a key stakeholder when implementing an out-of-province recruitment \nstrategy. Out-of-province students will need to move away from home to attend the University of \nAlberta, and we want to ensure that we provide them with residence options that will allow them \nto have an exceptional, safe, and welcoming experience. The initiative to guarantee a spot in \nresidence to every first-year student will resonate with students and parents.  \nAmong other initiatives to promote residence options with prospective students, such as \nproviding residence tours, and incorporating residence messaging in recruitment materials, we \nwill work with Residence Services to provide prospective students with an overnight campus \nresidence experience – an excellent way to build the profile and perceived quality of the on-\ncampus living experience. \n14 Page 9 of the draft University of Alberta Institutional Strategic Plan, March 2016 \nPage | 24  \n8.2 Region-specific Initiatives: Alberta \nOur Alberta strategy and initiatives are well established as part of our current state.

FACTORS FOR SUCCESS \nRelated, yet distinct from specific national recruitment tactics and initiatives, is ensuring that we \nhave effective coordination with university faculty and unit stakeholders, such as the \nRecruitment Network, as well as the appropriate infrastructure, processes, and policies to \nsupport out-of-province students in their admission journey. \nCoordinating Efforts \nUndergraduate recruitment within the University of Alberta is a decentralized function, with \nrecruitment staff, strategies, and materials existing in central units such as the Office of the \nRegistrar, as well as within many of the direct-entry faculties, as well as Business.  \nThe National Recruitment unit within the RO invests 80% of their time and resources to the top \nof the traditional Enrolment Funnel, captured in section 4, which is comprised of the Prospect \nand Inquiry phases, as well as a significant investment in the Applicant/Admitted phase. \nTwenty% of the National Recruitment unit’s focus is on the bottom half of the funnel, which is \ndedicated to yielding these eligible applicants. \nAcknowledging the strengths of our decentralized model, ideally faculties will have an inverse \nmodel, expending 80% of their resources on the lower half of the funnel focused on Admits and \nEnrolment phases, with the primary goal of increasing yield. This model would suggest that \nfaculties focus on ensuring that students who have received an offer to their program will follow \nthrough and accept their offer, register in classes, and engage them in “New to the U” activities \nin September. Knowing that there is value in having faculty-specific presence at key recruitment \nevents, 20% of a faculty’s recruitment focus ideally would be at the top half of funnel, focussing \non educating prospective students about their programs and offering program-specific advising. \nIt is important to note that a one-size fits all approach will not work for every faculty, and that \npercentages of investment at various stages of the traditional enrolment funnel may vary by \nfaculty, specifically for those who need to grow enrolment, versus selector faculties.  \nAugustana Campus and Campus Saint-Jean will each require a unique and tailored approach to \nthe enrolment funnel, compared to most North-Campus faculties. These campuses will require a \nlarger proportion of their investment of time and resources at the top of the funnel to recruit for \ntheir respective programs, highlight their differentiating factors, and connect with markets that \nsuggest potential for good fit. Faculty-based recruitment staff at these campuses will also need \nto continue to invest their resources at the bottom half of the funnel to ultimately yield their \neligible applicants, resulting in a hybrid approach.   \nWorking within a decentralized recruitment model offers many benefits in terms of the \nspecialized program knowledge, connections to academics, and relationships with students, not \nonly as newly admitted students, but also in an advising capacity with continuing students within \nthe faculty. This creates a sense of confidence and familiarity for new students.  \nPage | 34  \nDecentralization also comes with a number of challenges. While institutional pockets appear to \nbe deep if we combine all of the recruitment dollars currently being spent across campus, those \npockets are much more shallow in individual units, sometimes limiting the scope of what can be \nimplemented unless there is a willingness for both functional and financial collaboration.  \nAnother challenge is that each faculty has their own unique visual identity, often designed and \nimplemented to align with other faculty directed initiatives and functions (i.e. alumni \nengagement, industry relationships, etc.). Faculty-based recruiters have shared that the visual \nidentity of their recruitment materials sometimes lies outside of their control due to other \npriorities within the faculty. Throughout our consultations with faculties, they have shared that it \nwill require senior-level central support and direction to move towards cohesiveness.  \nThe primary issue here is that the existence of 10-12 different visual identities, although \ncompliant with institutional branding guidelines, creates confusion in terms of a clear visual \nUniversity of Alberta identity, as well as visual clutter or even dissonance, at multi-\nrepresentative recruitment events. While this has not been as much of a barrier when recruiting \nwithin Edmonton, it will be detrimental to our overarching need to have a strong institutional \nbrand and awareness in regions that are not yet familiar with us. Ensuring that all out-of-\nprovince marketing and materials consistently lead with the cohesive University of Alberta visual \nidentity is crucial to the success of these recruiting activities. All materials used to recruit out-of-\nprovince students will need to be clearly linked to our institutional brand, clearly indicate \nUniversity of Alberta, and share a similar look and feel. \nMoving forward, we need to align ourselves in the following ways: \n● institutional look/visual consistency for pull up banners, table cloths, and other collateral \nused to visually represent the University when recruiting students, and  \n● visual consistency amongst central and faculty prospective student publications. \nCollaborating and coordinating is key to our success out-of-province, an area of required \nimprovement current state. To support this strategy, as well as undergraduate recruitment more \ngenerally, there is a proposed restructuring of the decision-making process around recruitment, \nwhich has previously existed primarily within the Recruitment Network. While this is an \nimportant network of recruitment professionals from across campus, there are varying levels of \ndecision-making authority and experience at the table, making it very difficult to move forward \non higher level strategic thinking and decisions. The Recruitment Network should remain active \nand can focus on tactical initiatives, aligning travel schedules, and developing larger team \nidentity. However, it is proposed that a National Recruitment Advisory Group be established, \nmade up of decision makers surrounding recruitment, who can work together to develop a more \ncollaborative approach to undergraduate recruitment for the institution, work to time initiatives \naccording to a student-centred perspective, and discuss respective recruitment mandates and \nstrategies. \nPage | 35  \nAutomatic Admission Evaluation \nAs part of the University’s 10 Point Enrolment Management Plan, the Registrar’s Office is \nworking to implement automatic admission evaluation in Campus Solutions for high school \napplicants applying to 2017-18. This will decrease the amount of time required of Admissions \nAdvisors to process these files and in turn will speed the processing of other applicants, moving \nthem through the recruitment funnel more quickly.  \nApproved Out-of-Province Courses for Admission \nIn order to be competitive, we will ensure that we are accepting the appropriate academic \nsubjects offered within out-of-province markets, specifically those that are accepted by other \nTop 5 Canadian institutions. This could increase overall eligibility of quality out-of-province \nstudents who may present subjects that we may not accept current state. Related to this, we will \nalso explore variations in admission standards for out-of-province students if they were to apply \nto a home province university comparable to the University of Alberta. For example, if they \nwould be admissible to an equivalently competitive institution in their home province on a \ndifferent set of requirements, we need to consider the potential to adjust our admission \nrequirements to ensure that we remain competitive in our capacity to attract exceptional \nundergraduate students. In addition, for transfer student recruitment to be successful, faculties \nand the RO must work together to establish a database of accepted out-of-province transfer \ncourses for the purpose of advising and recruiting these students. \nApplicant Experience \nThe multi-phase Undergraduate Admissions Project, also currently underway, is focused on \nimproving the Applicant experience, which is inclusive of admission communications. Campus \nSolutions, as well as Bear Tracks, our current online student system, present several challenges \nwith respect to communicating with applicants. For example, many students have difficulty \nfinding information about their admission status in Bear Tracks and/or the specific comments \nmade by an admissions advisor that are critical to their admission. Plans are currently in place \nto replace our admission system, which will allow us to more effectively communicate with \napplicants. This will be helpful for recruiting out-of-province students (and their high school \ncounsellors or college advisors) who are less familiar with University of Alberta’s admission \npractices. \nPage | 36  \n10. PROCESS \nDevelopment of this strategy has followed a highly consultative and collaborative process which \nwill continue to be required in order to support the successful implementation of this strategy. \nBuilding on the advice and guidance provided for the writing of the Undergraduate National \nRecruitment Discussion paper (November 2015), the Undergraduate National Recruitment \nSteering Committee has continued to be a strong support base for the strategy.  \nThroughout the consultation pathway with the discussion paper, by late 2015 it was apparent \nthat we needed more and deeper engagement with our direct-entry faculties (and Business) in \norder to ensure that the perspectives and interests of both central and faculty-based recruitment \nfunctions are represented in this strategy. Through a combination of one-on-one meetings with \n11 faculties, as well as 22 regional and topic-specific working sessions made up of a diverse \ngroup of faculty representatives, we have facilitated a total of 33 discussions in early 2016 that \nserved to stimulate thought and rich discussion, which ultimately resulted in recommendations \nthat have helped shape this strategy.  \nTo address the critical need for branding and awareness in markets we are currently not active \nin, a University Awareness working group, made up of representatives from Marketing and \nCommunications, University Relations, as well as the National Recruitment and \nCommunications units from the Office of the Registrar, was created. The group focused on \ntactical approach options to build awareness among prospective students and their influencers \nin various markets, and the importance of collaboration and alignment of efforts moving forward, \nas University Relations develops an institutional awareness campaign.  \nUniversity Relations will be targeting prospective students and their influencers as two of the \naudiences of interest in their future awareness campaigns and will therefore focus some of their \nactivities on target markets similar to those that are identified for our out-of-province recruitment \nactivities. University Relations will lead the creative work (and related resourcing request) for \nthis awareness campaign separately, in addition to and complementary to this national \nrecruitment strategy. All out-of-province national recruitment marketing will align with the overall \ninstitutional awareness and messaging, but include the calls to action such as visit campus, \napply, and attend. It is agreed that for us to be successful recruiting out-of-province students, an \ninstitutional awareness campaign will be required.  \nThis strategy document is considered to be a living document that will continue to evolve as we \nshare it across campus and through various consultations with faculties and administrative \nunits. Tactical recruitment plans will be designed and drawn from the scope contained within \nthis document. \nPage | 37  \n11. ASSESSMENT \nAs we move forward with implementing the recommendations and initiatives outlined above, it is \nimportant to assess our progress and accomplishments, and adapt as we learn more through \nour work, both in Alberta and out-of-province. We will pay close attention to enrolment data in \nour target regions, such as applicant numbers and yield rates, as well as ensuring diligence in \ncapturing prospective student data at events to engage, gauge effectiveness of initiatives, and \nmonitor their progress throughout the admission cycle. Other key performance indicators will be \ncreated by region, such as establishing event attendance benchmarks. \nPreliminary Assessment Plan \nWrapping back to our multi-year strategic approach, we know that it will take approximately \nthree years to measure enrolment results. Here is our plan for initial assessment: \n● Monitor increases in Prospect and Inquiry interest, as captured in our Prospect tracking \ndatabase \n● Assess eligibility of applications from our target regions on an annual basis, \n● Track the completeness of applications (i.e. did they submit their application and all of \nthe necessary documents to be considered for admission or did they leave the process \nbefore submitting) for target region applicants \n● Measure the number of applicants that accept their offers of admission and register in \nclasses, as well as total number of enrolled undergraduate students from out-of-province \n● Investigate admissibility challenges by region based on UDYAN comments utilized, \n● Evaluate recruitment initiatives by tracking overall attendance and levels of interest \nwithin each region, and \n● Once evaluations are complete, and enrolment data outlines our progress, we will adjust \ntarget regions and initiatives as required \n1 \nSeptember 30, 2016  Draft \nKey Performance Indicators and Measures for the Undergraduate \nNational Recruitment Strategy \n1. Background  \n● With the release of the Undergraduate National Recruitment Strategy, and specifically the new \ninitiatives outlined for out-of-province recruitment, it is important to note how success will be \nmeasured in each year of the plan.1 \n● Increasing awareness, and ultimately enrolment, of out-of-province students requires a phased \napproach between Fall 2016 and 2020. Therefore, outcomes for each region, depending on their \ncurrent level of UAlberta awareness, will vary. 2016 will be used as a baseline to establish \nregional targets. \n2. Phases and Measures of Success \n● Given the varying levels of UAlberta awareness in out-of-province target regions, some markets \nmay experience accelerated growth while others may have slower growth rates.  \n● The majority of target regions outside Alberta which have been identified for recruitment \nexpansion have low awareness of UAlberta overall. All regions/initiatives will be assessed and \nmeasured in the following ways: \nENGAGE – Year 1 \n• The Engage phase is characterised by a focus on increasing opportunities for students to connect \nwith and learn about UAlberta. It is also focused on generating interest and leads for the \nUniversity of Alberta. The outcomes from Engage phase, primarily measured through leads, will \nbe used to create a baseline for determining regional specific targets and growth plans. \n• Primary Measure \no Leads: Each initiative connecting prospective students to UAlberta will provide the \n1 The Alberta initiatives outlined in the Undergraduate National Recruitment Strategy will continue to be \nevaluated as per previous years, with specific attention to quality of applicants and overall yield by region.  \n2 \nopportunity for us to generate “leads” or potential recruits. Students will be able to provide \ntheir contact information for the purpose of receiving communication and engagement \nopportunities throughout the recruitment cycle. This information is used to track the type \nof attendees (i.e. grade, or whether they are Aboriginal, etc.), as well as assess the \neffectiveness of the initiative. The contact management system, Salesforce, loads and \nmatches applicant data from Campus Solutions to existing prospect information, allowing \ntrends to be identified, such as which event brings the highest percentage of attendees \nwho submit a UAlberta application for admission.  \no Specific measures include tracking: The number of leads per event, the percentage of \napplicants, eligible and registered students by event attended, grade of attending \nstudents, type of attending student (AP, IB, Aboriginal, International within Canada, etc.), \nnumber of events attended per student, comparing yield rates of in-person attended \nevents vs attendance at online events, and lastly, assist in identifying “sweet-spots” such \nas the number of prospective student events attended vs likelihood to yield a student. \no Goal: Acquire 16 leads per in-person recruitment week in target regions. \n• Secondary Measure \no Event Attendance: Each initiative attended or hosted by National Recruitment will be \nevaluated. Data collected includes the total number of attendees, number of publications \ndistributed at the event, number of students who provide us with their contact information, \nnotes on the event itself, and an overall rating by the attending staff member out of 10 for \nquality/usefulness of event. For larger events, participant survey data is collected and \nanalyzed for future improvements. In addition, all online initiatives are tracked, i.e. \nattendance numbers for online presentations and chat events. \no Goal: Fall 2016 will be a baseline year to create future year measures. Increase \nattendance numbers at each event by 10% in Fall 2017. \nAPPLY – Year 2 \n• The apply phase will focus on increasing the number of applications received in target regions. \nThis will be inclusive of noting the percentage of top students (90%), as well as the percentage of \nstudents who present admission averages that exceed established competitive admission \naverages by faculty.  \n• Primary Measure \no Applicants2: Using Campus Solutions Queries to assess applicant numbers within the \ncurrent recruitment cycle is key. Applicant numbers will be pulled throughout the cycle \nreflecting individual applicants, last school attended, and region. Applications to date will \nbe compared to historical applicant information from the previous two admission cycles in \norder to identify trends and areas of growth.  \no Goal: Identify trends in applicants by region/last school attended based on baseline year. \nRefine regional specific targets and goals. The number of applications received will \nindicate the overall movement from the interest phase to action phase.  \no  \n• Secondary Measure \no Eligible Applicant Data: A key metric of our success is the number of eligible applicants \n2 Note: In addition to noting overall numbers of applicants, we also sort data to assess trends by applicant \ntype, such as Aboriginal, International Students studying in Canada, IB and AP, as well as transfer and \nmature students. \n3 \n(i.e. the number of applicants who receive an offer of admission).  \nACCEPT/ENROL – Year 3 \n• Increase the number of eligible applicants who accept their offer of admission, and register in \nclasses (enrol). \n• Primary Measure: \no Eligible Applicant Data: During this third year, eligible applicants will move from a \nsecondary measure to a primary measure. We will look specifically at high achieving and \nhighly eligible students (defined above) as subsets of this measure. \no High Achieving Students: The overall percentage of eligible applicants who have an \nadmission average of 90.0% or higher in our target regions will be of particular interest. \no Goal: Increase the percentage of 90.0%+ students by 1.0% as an aggregate for out-of-\nprovince in year 2. \no Highly Eligible Students: The overall percentage of eligible applicants who have \nadmission averages that are 3 to 5% above the mean competitive average for their \nfaculty of choice will be noted. \no Goal: Increase the number of students in this category by 2% as an aggregate for out-of-\nprovince in year 2. \n• Secondary Measure: \no Conversion (Yield):  We will capture information on the number of students in each \ntarget region who have accepted their offer of admission, and use “Registered” numbers \nto determine yield percentages by region and by school.  \no Goal: Increase overall enrolment in the first two years by 0.5%, and by 1.5% in year 3. \nNoting conversion rates will inform the future investment of resources, and areas of \nopportunity. \nENROL – Year 4 \n• Increase the number of out-of-province students enrolled at UAlberta, and at minimum maintain \ntarget market share in each target region thereafter.  \n• Primary Measure: \no Conversion (Yield):  We will capture information on the number of students in each \ntarget region who have accepted their offer of admission, and use “Registered” numbers \nto determine yield percentages by region and by school.  \no Goal: Increase overall enrolment in the first two years by 0.5%, and by 1.5% in year 4. \nNoting conversion rates will inform the future investment of resources, and areas of \nopportunity \n4 \n3. Enrolment Targets \nAs a result of our phased approach, slower out-of-province enrolment growth rates are anticipated within \nthe first 2 years (a 0.5% increase per year in first 2 years) followed by a 1.5% increase per year in last 2 \nyears. Although these increases may seem minimal, they are quite aggressive given current enrolment \ngrowth trends in these markets, as well as the competitive recruitment landscape.3 The table below \noutlines the projected growth pattern.4  \nGrowth Scenario for Total Out-of-Province Enrolment (New plus Continuing) \n4. Measures of Interest  \nThere are additional measures that will be tracked over time to ensure that the recruitment objectives \noutlined in the National Recruitment Strategy support the retention and enrolment objectives of the \nuniversity. \n● First year performance: Once the overall enrolment of out-of-province students has increased, \nassessing first year academic performance relative to students from Alberta will be required. This \ninformation will be used to refine future recruitment strategies. Having multi-year data to \neffectively assess the first year performance of out-of-province students will be critical for strategy \ndevelopment and evaluation. \n● Program Diversity: The distribution of applicants across direct-entry faculties will be assessed \nfor the purpose of noting programs of interest by region. We will also use this information to \nidentify areas of opportunity for faculties who are under-enrolled or who would like to increase \nnational representation in their programs. \n3 Goals and numbers for out of province enrolment at Canadian universities are not easily obtained. For \nsome context the University of British Columbia 2014 Annual Report on Enrolment: Vancouver Campus, \nthe University reports that they will “expand the proportion of undergraduate students from other \nCanadian provinces” but do not provide current out of province enrolment data. The University of Toronto \n2015 Enrolment Report, provides information that 7.8% of undergraduate students are from other \nprovinces in Canada but provides no goals suggesting either an increase or decrease in that figure. \n4 Note: These numbers are for illustration purposes only, and are not concrete. Numbers reflect total out-\nof-province enrolment. \nhttps://senate.ubc.ca/sites/senate.ubc.ca/files/downloads/2014-15%20Vancouver%20Enrolment%20report%20%2820%20February%202015%29.pdf\nhttp://www.provost.utoronto.ca/Assets/Provost+Digital+Assets/Enrolment+Report+2015-16+(R).pdf\nhttp://www.provost.utoronto.ca/Assets/Provost+Digital+Assets/Enrolment+Report+2015-16+(R).pdf\n5 \n● Degree Completion/Retention: Six-year degree completion rates and year over year retention \nrates of out-of-province students will be tracked and compared across target regions. This \ninformation will help to indicate out of province student quality and again assist in refining and \ndeveloping the recruitment strategy over time. \n• Undergraduate Student Financial Strategy: Undergraduate financial support is a critical \ncomponent in student recruitment. As the Undergraduate Student Financial Strategy is \ndeveloped, we will cross-reference measurement between both strategies. \nItem No. 7 \nGFC ACADEMIC PLANNING COMMITTEE \nFor the Meeting of October 26, 2016 \n OUTLINE OF ISSUE \nAction Item \nAgenda Title: Proposed Changes to the Statement on Equity in Student Affairs \nMotion:  THAT the GFC Academic Planning Committee, under delegated authority from General Faculties \nCouncil, recommend to General Faculties Council, proposed changes to the Statement on Equity in Student \nAffairs found in the section University Regulations and Information for Students/General University \nPolicies/Statement on Equity in Student Affairs of the University Calendar as submitted by the Office of the \nRegistrar and as set forth in Attachment 1, to take effect upon final approval. \nItem   \nAction Requested Approval Recommendation   \nProposed by Lisa Collins, Vice-Provost and University Registrar \nPresenter Lisa Collins, Vice-Provost and University Registrar \nDetails \nResponsibility Provost and Vice-President (Academic) \nThe Purpose of the Proposal is \n(please be specific) \nTo revise the Student Statement on Equity to reflect changes to Alberta \nHuman Rights Legislation and changing norms in diversity and equity \nwithin the academy. \nThe Impact of the Proposal is The proposed changes align with the University Statement on Equity \nwhich is used on all academic and support staff job postings as outlined \nin the UAPPOL Procedures for Academic Staff Posting and Advertising \nand Support Staff Posting and Advertising.  \nReplaces/Revises (eg, policies, \nresolutions) \nRevises Statement on Equity in Student Affairs, the General Admission \nRequirements and the Evaluation Procedures and Grading System of \nthe University Calendar \nTimeline/Implementation Date 2017-2018 University Calendar \nEstimated Cost and funding \nsource \nN/A \nNext Steps (ie.: \nCommunications Plan, \nImplementation plans) \nThe revised Statement on Equity in Student Affairs would be included in \nthe 2017-18 University Calendar. \nSupplementary Notes and \ncontext \nEngagement and Routing (Include meeting dates) \nParticipation: \n(parties who have seen the \nproposal and in what capacity) \n<For further information see \nthe link posted on \nthe Governance Toolkit section \nStudent Participation Protocol> \nThose who have been informed: \n• Jay Spark Vice-Provost & Associate VP (HR) and the Office of \nFaculty Relations - August 19, 2015 \nThose who have been consulted: \n• Heather Zwicker, Vice-Provost  Interim Dean, FGSR - August 20, \n2015 \n• Employment and Equity Advisory Committee (HRS)  - September \n17, 2015 \n• Jax Oltean, University General Counsel - September 21, 2015 \n• Mike MacGregor, Vice Provost and Associate Vice-President, \nItem 7 - page 1\nhttps://policiesonline.ualberta.ca/PoliciesProcedures/Procedures/Academic-Staff-Posting-and-Advertising-Procedure.pdf\nhttps://policiesonline.ualberta.ca/PoliciesProcedures/Procedures/Support-Staff-Posting-and-Advertising-Procedure.pdf\nhttp://www.governance.ualberta.ca/GovernanceToolkit/Toolkit.aspx\nhttp://www.governance.ualberta.ca/GovernanceToolkit/Toolkit.aspx\nItem No. 7 \nGFC ACADEMIC PLANNING COMMITTEE \nFor the Meeting of October 26, 2016 \nInformation Services and Technology - September 26, 2015 \n• Dr. Fraser Brenneis, Vice-Dean, Education, Faculty of Medicine \nand Dentistry - December 23, 2016 \n• Dr. Lise Gotell, Acting Dean, Faculty of Arts - December 23, 2016 \n• Roger Graves, Director, Centre for Teaching and Learning - \nDecember 23, 2015 \n• Cody Bondarchuk, VP External, Students Union – February 8, \n2016 \n• Harsh Thaker, Graduate Students Association – February 8, \n2016 \n• Human Resource Services Team – March 7, 2016 \n• Vice-Provost Council – April 4, 2016 \n• Council on Aboriginal Initiatives - April 17, 2016 \n• Phyllis Clark, VP Finance and Administration – April 26, 2016 \n• President’s Executive Committee (Operations) - April 28, 2016 \n• Brad Hamdon, University General Counsel – April 29, 2016 \n• Committee on the Learning Environment - June 1, 2016 \n• Dean’s Council – June 1, 2016 \n• Academic standards committee  - May 19, 2016 – For \nreview/advice \n• Employment and Equity Advisory Committee – August 9, 2016 \nThose who are actively participating: \nThe Statement on Equity Working Group is responsible for the \ndevelopment of the University and Student Statements of Equity.

In this manner the \nUniversity demonstrates its commitment to \nimproving the representativeness of its \ncommunities. \nThe Alberta Human Rights Act, sections \n3 and 11.1, requires that no individual be \ndiscriminated against on the basis of race, \nreligious beliefs, color, gender, physical \ndisability, mental disability, marital status, \nage, ancestry, or place of origin, family status, \nor source of income except where \nthe discrimination can be shown to be \nreasonable and justifiable. The University of \nAlberta recognizes and accepts its \nresponsibility to comply with the requirements \nof this Act in its consideration of students for \nadmission, promotion, and graduation. Of its \nown volition the University of Alberta does not \ndiscriminate on the basis of sexual orientation \nor political belief. \nSubject to the limits set out in the \nAlberta Human Rights Act, the University of \nAlberta affirms its right to determine the \ncriteria by which applicants are accepted into \nthe University community. Individuals seeking \nadmission to or continuance in academic \nprograms must meet the qualifications and \nperformance standards set out by the \nUniversity Equity Statement in Student \nAffairs \nThe University recognizes the diversity of the \nCanadian population and obligation to be \naccessible to all sectors of society. The \nUniversity therefore encourages diversity and \nwelcomes applications from all qualified \npersons including women, members of visible \nminorities, First Nations, Métis, and Inuit, \npersons with disabilities, and sexual and \ngender minorities. The University Calendar \nwill use gender inclusive language when \nreferring to members of the University \nCommunity. This demonstrates the \nUniversity’s commitment to accommodating \nand improving the representativeness of \nits diverse communities. \nThe Alberta Human Rights Act, prohibits \ndiscrimination against any person because \nof race, religious beliefs, colour, \ngender, gender identity, gender expression, \nphysical disability, mental disability, ancestry, \nplace of origin, marital status, source of \nincome, family status or sexual \norientation, except where the distinction can \nbe shown to be reasonable and justifiable in \nthe circumstances. The University of \nAlberta complies with the Act when it \nconsiders students for admission, promotion, \nand graduation. Of its own volition, the \nUniversity of Alberta does not discriminate on \nthe basis of political belief.  \nSubject to the limits set out in the Alberta \nHuman Rights Act, the University of Alberta \naffirms its right to determine the criteria by \nwhich applicants are accepted into the \nUniversity community.

The proposed changes to consolidate our undergraduate honors \nand specialization programs will enhance undergraduate student experiences and more \naccurately communicate the breadth, strengths and focus of the Biological Sciences \nprograms. We are a large and diverse department that provides substantive experiential \nlearning, however the size of our department can pose challenges for undergraduate \nstudents trying to choose our programs or discern differences amongst the breadth of \ndisciplines. We currently offer seven honors and seven specialization programs, which \nmostly reflected outdated boundaries of departments that were merged into a larger \nBiological Sciences Department over 20 years ago. The proposed changes avoid taxonomic \ndesignations (e.g., Animal Biology, Plant Biology) and more appropriately reflect broader \nareas in Biological Sciences, rather than revolve content around specific organisms that \nmay be used to study these important disciplines. The outcome of this re-evaluation is a \nreduction in our total number of programs, while still providing students with an exemplary \neducation that reflects appropriate depth and breadth to meet the challenges of changing \nand broad career opportunities in the Biological Sciences. \nThe set of Program Name Changes and Program Suspension submitted reflects this \ndepartmental-wide consolidation of seven honors/specialization programs (Animal \nBiology, Ecology, Evolutionary Biology, Molecular Genetics, Microbiology, Physiology \nand Developmental Biology, and Plant Biology) to three:  \n(1) Ecology, Evolution and Environmental Biology (newly proposed name for Ecology); \n(2) Integrative Physiology (newly proposed name for Physiology and Developmental \nBiology); and \n(3) Molecular, Cellular and Developmental Biology (newly proposed name for Molecular \nGenetics). \nSimultaneously, we propose to suspend the following honors/specialization programs: \n(1) Animal Biology \n(2) Evolutionary Biology \n(3) Microbiology \n(4) Plant Biology \nWe are not proposing changes to either of our joint programs: (1) Immunology and \nInfection (joint with Medical Microbiology and Immunology) or (2) Paleontology (joint \nwith Department of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences).  Nor are we proposing any changes \nto the General Biological Sciences Major. \nThese changes result in programs that have broad appeal, provide greater flexibility, and \naccurately describe program learning outcomes and content.  We are not changing the core \nrequirements of any of the three newly named programs but rather highlighting expanded \n3 \nlistings of course choices to meet the learning outcomes of the programs. All programs \ncontinue to share a common set of first year course requirements.  \nAll students in suspended programs will be given the opportunity to complete their \nprograms. For those students who are interested in these suspended programs, all of them \nare fully captured in the three renamed programs. Depending on interests, there is one of \nthe newly named programs that is a natural fit, for others, there may be more than one of \nthe newly named programs that would work. For example, Evolutionary Biology has \nalways been an integral part of the Ecology program. Similarly, Microbiology and Plant \nBiology courses were incorporated into and remain key to our Molecular, Cellular and \nDevelopmental Biology Programs (newly proposed name for Molecular Genetics \nPrograms). Students interested in the Plant Biology and Microbiology programs will just as \neasily fit in the Ecology, Evolution and Environmental Biology Programs (newly proposed \nname for Ecology Programs) if they are more interested how these organisms evolve and \ninteract in their environment than their molecular basis. Along these veins, all three newly \nnamed programs would fulfill goals of students interested in Animal Biology, depending on \nwhether they wanted to focus on their physiology, their ecology and evolution, or their \nmolecular and cellular processes.  \nThis consolidation of programs also permits students to explore more of the large and \ndiverse Department of Biological Sciences offerings. If they discover an unexpected \ninterest (ie, genetics students discovering love for plant biology), they are now able to more \neasily take additional courses in that area without having to formally change programs. \nSwitching programs often results in students taking an extra term or extra year to complete \nrequirements. Similarly, students who have identified and maintain a particular fascination \n(e.g., animal biology) will have the direction to take classes that provide substantial depth \nof knowledge in that discipline. The consolidated course listings within the three renamed \nprograms makes them less restrictive for undergraduate students, thus taking perhaps \noverly complicated programs to ones that provide more choice. The learning outcomes, \ncore requirements, rigor, depth, and excellence of our programs remain the same.  \nFurther, the newly structured programs maintain and increase the flexibility for students to \nparticipate in the Science Internship Program (SIP) and/or completion of the Research \nCertificate in Science (Biological Sciences). These two opportunities are aligned with the \nUniversity of Alberta’s new Institutional Strategic Plan “For the Public Good” that sets out \nto increase access to internships and support for excellence in teaching, particularly \nexperiential learning, as objectives. \nThis restructuring was initiated at a Department of Biological Sciences Executive Retreat \nin November 2014, wherein we challenged ourselves to reexamine our undergraduate \nprograms as though they were new rather than products of historical departments. The \nproposed restructuring was then discussed and/or voted on at three departmental council \nmeetings (15 April 2015, 9 December 2015, 10 February 2016).  Further, we facilitated \ndepartment-wide discussion of changes via two avenues. First, we developed a \ndepartmental website that included our student survey (see below) and proposed changes to \n4 \nour programs. Second, we coordinated three informal meetings to which our invested \nstakeholders attended and discussed changes to our newly named programs (30 November \n2015, 1 December 2015, 4 December 2015).  \nImportantly, students also support this restructuring. In March 2015, we conducted an \nanonymous online survey of our Biological Sciences students. We also led three focal \nmeetings with groups of students including students registered in our honors/specialization \nprograms and in the general program (two on 27 March 2015, one on 30 March 2015). Of \nthe 554 respondents to the online survey, 192 were in our honor/specialization programs (= \n44% of total students enrolled in the honors/specialization programs) and 353 were in the \nGeneral Biological Sciences Program (= 23% of the total number of students in the General \nProgram). The majority of these respondents (71%) stated that our seven \nhonors/specialization programs have limited (which allowed us to determine which \nprograms to maintain) and strong (which allowed us to determine which programs to \nsuspend) overlap. Similarly, students indicated that having three honors/specialization \nprograms versus seven was acceptable (29%), slightly acceptable (26%), neutral (20%), \nslightly unacceptable (18%), and unacceptable (7%).  In sum, 75% of the students surveyed \neither accepted or were neutral about the consolidation to three honors/specialization \nprograms. A few comments regarding these changes are provided here: \n● “I actually quite like the idea of three overarching areas of study. It makes decision-\nmaking easier and less overwhelming while still maintaining the aspect of choice.” \n● “It is confusing distinguishing between the many different programs.” \n● “It can be a little bit overwhelming differentiating between all of the programs.” \n● “There is so much overlap between all of the biological sciences programs – \nespecially between different ‘animal related’/‘plant’/‘ecology’ related programs that \neven though there are quite a few different programs offered, the overlap effectively \nreduces the number of programs offered because they’re all so similar.” \n● “I feel as though the programs that exist are not easily understandable.” \nConversely, a small minority opinion is that the focus of seven programs provides \nappropriate depth for students who have a passion in one of these areas (e.g., Microbiology, \nPlant Biology). We greatly appreciate these concerns and will ameliorate them in three \nways. First, we will effectively use our departmental website to help students choose \ncourses that meet degree requirements and emphasize particular subdisciplines by \nidentifying informal streams within newly named programs. Second, we will maintain our \nset of faculty advisors who can actively help students identify interests and understand \nappropriate course sequences to achieve their academic goals. Finally, we are not changing \nour course offerings, such that with few minor exceptions all of our current courses are still \navailable to our students. In other words, all newly named programs accommodate these \ninterests. \nRationale for name change of Ecology Programs \n5 \nThe newly proposed name Ecology, Evolution, and Environmental Biology more \nappropriately reflects the breadth of this area of biology, the importance of the integration \nof fields, the goals and outcomes of this program, and our strong reputation as Canadian \nleaders this field. Ecology does not fully articulate the contents of this program or field of \nscience, which has always emphasized evolutionary biology and environmental sciences. In \nfact, this program was formerly named Environmental Biology, which exemplifies the \nchallenges of settling on a narrowly defined name for this program.  \nEcology, evolutionary biology and environmental biology are integrated areas of biology, \nas reflected in the common departmental name of Ecology and Evolutionary Biology at \nother institutions (e.g., University of Toronto) and in the Canadian Society for Ecology and \nEvolution (CSEE). For example, community and population ecology impacts biological \ndiversity and macroevolution and vice versa.  In sum, the proposed name more accurately \nreflects that academic preparation we provide our students for a range of career \nopportunities.  \nThe description of the first two years of the program remains almost identical to the current \ncalendar description for Ecology Program (and Evolutionary Biology program). However, \nthe course lists (from which students choose a set number to complete to meet their \nprogram requirements) beyond this core were reorganized into broader themes in Ecology, \nEvolution, and Environmental Biology: \n(1) Biological Diversity, \n(2) Biological Processes, \n(3) Ecology and Environmental Biology, \n(4) Evolution and Systematics, and \n(5) Scientific Methodology \nThese restructured lists provide more flexible options in which students will deepen and \nbroaden their knowledge. Further, these lists highlight the incorporation of evolutionary \nand environmental biology that was already integral to the Ecology Program. The rigor of \nthe program is maintained, if not enhanced, by the consolidating of course lists. In other \nwords, we are providing undergraduate students with a program in which they may explore \nthe many integrated facets of Ecology, Evolution, and Environmental Biology. The explicit \nnaming of these lists makes the goals of the program clear to the students so they have a \nbetter understanding of why we are requiring them to take a subset of those classes.  \nThe inclusion of evolution and environmental biology in the name of the Ecology program \ngenerally aligns with other institutions in Campus Alberta that offer BSc degrees in \nBiology, although there is wide variation in names across the province. MacEwan \nUniversity offers a general program in Biology with two streams (comparable stream to our \nnewly named program is Ecology/Environmental biology).  The University of Calgary \noffers programs in Biological Sciences (comparable to our general program), Ecology, and \nEnvironmental Science – Biological Sciences Concentration. The following Albertan \n6 \ninstitutions have general degrees in Biology without further formal divisions (similar to \nMacEwan): Concordia University, University of Lethbridge, Mount Royal University, and \nSt. Mary’s University. \nThis new program name more closely aligns with trends at larger Canadian institutions, \nalthough we must emphasize the breadth that Biological Sciences encompasses, providing \nmany opportunities for division. University of British Columbia offers BSc degrees in (a) \nEcology and Environmental Biology and (b) Environmental Biology.  The Department of \nEcology and Evolutionary Biology, University of Toronto, offers programs in (a) Ecology \nand Evolutionary Biology, (b) Environmental Biology, and (c) Biodiversity and \nConservation.  It is interesting to note that this UoT department discontinued their separate \nEcology and Evolutionary Biology programs in January 2011.  \n4. Impacts on students (active, stop-outs, graduates) and plans to ameliorate these impacts.  \nInclude evidence of consultation with students, as well as plans to allow active students the \nopportunity to graduate with the established credential (should they wish), and plans to deal \nwith graduates of the program coming forward to request an exchange of their credential \nfor the new. \nOur online survey revealed that students that were opposed to three honors/specialization \nversus seven programs were mostly concerned for two reasons: (1) they did not have \nadequate information on what the three programs would entail thus were concerned they \ncould not specialize in Ecology and (2) they did not want to take courses that were not of \ninterest to them. The first year of the program remains completely unchanged and common \nto all our honors and specialization programs. All the courses listed in the Ecology program \nare listed in the Ecology, Evolution, and Environmental Biology program; they are simply \nre-arranged into more flexible and larger listings of courses from which students can \nchoose courses to meet their program requirements. As such, the depth of the programs \nremains unchanged, but does provide more options for students who want increased \nbreadth. In sum, there is no effect on content and quality of the programs and the core and \nfocus remains unchanged.  We have simply broadened our existing course lists to provide \nmore options and more flexibility. \n5. Provide evidence of consultation with relevant external stakeholders, for instance \nemployers, professional/regulatory organizations or other post-secondary institutions.  \nIdentify anticipated impacts on stakeholder groups (if any) and outline plans to ameliorate \nimpacts. \nJennifer Sipkens, Executive Director, Alberta Society of Professional Biologists was \nconsulted about all proposed changes to our programs, including all proposed name \nchanges and suspensions. Because requirements for membership are based on total number \n7 \nof courses, not specific program names, these changes will not affect this organization or \nour students’ eligibility to apply for Professional Biologist status.  \nProposed name changes were presented at ACAT Sciences Articulation Committee 9 May \n2016. No concerns were voiced. Attendees included representatives from Ambrose \nUniversity, Univ. of Lethbridge, MacEwan, Grand Prairie Regional College, Lakeland \nCollege, Mount Royale Univ., Red Deer College, Univ. of Alberta, Univ. of Calgary, \nMedicine Hat College, and St. Mary’s University.  ACAT secretariats (Clare Ard and Eric \nDohei) and Caroline Nixon from Alberta Education were also in attendance. \n6. Identify anticipated impacts on relevant units within the institution (e.g. Registrar’s Office, \nCommunications) and summarize the implications of the proposed change for institutional \nresources. \nThe proposed name change to the degree title for honors and specialization will not impact \nthe number of students admitted to the Faculty of Science either by an increase or decrease. \nThe proposed name change may increase the number of students admitted to the honors \nand specialization program given that this change occurs with subsequent proposed \nsuspensions of other programs (Animal Biology, Evolutionary Biology, Microbiology and \nPlant Biology). We will monitor the impact of names change on demand for the degree.  \nThe Department of Biological Sciences and the Faculty of Science will revise the records \nand documents under their respective control to incorporate the new degree name. These \nwill include, but are not limited to, Departmental and Faculty forms and Departmental and \nFaculty websites. The University will revise records and documents under its control, \nincluding the University website and University publications.  If approved, we will \nundertake the formal procedures to revise references to the program in the University \nCalendar and any University policy or procedure that references or mentions the Ecology \nProgram. These changes will be advertised in the University Calendar for one year before \nimplementation. The costs associated with these revisions would not result in any new \nexpenses for the Faculty or the University as they would be absorbed in existing budgets, \nwhich take into account ongoing revision of forms, websites, and calendar changes. \nThe proposed degree name changes will affect the Office of the Registrar in two contexts. \nFirst, changes will need to be made to degree codes, program codes and application \nprocesses. The costs associated with these revisions would not result in any new expenses \nfor the Faculty or the University as they would be absorbed in existing budgets. Second, \nstudents who begin the first year of the program in the year that the degree title changes \nwill graduate with a BSc Specialization and Honors in Ecology, Evolution and \nEnvironmental Biology. Students further along in their programs will be permitted to \nchoose which program name appears on their Degree Parchment, either honors or \nspecialization degree in Ecology or Ecology, Evolution and Environmental Biology. \nStudents who choose the former name of Ecology would have 5 years to complete their \n8 \nprograms with this name available for their Degree Parchment. The Department of \nBiological Sciences and the Faculty of Science will communicate with enrolled students \nabout their choices for which name of program would be listed on degree parchment. \n1 \nProposal Template: Program/Specialization Name Changes \nThis template is for the presentation of proposals to change the title of an existing program or \nspecialization within an existing program.

The outcome of this re-evaluation is a \nreduction in our total number of programs, while still providing students with an exemplary \neducation that reflects appropriate depth and breadth to meet the challenges of changing \nand broad career opportunities in the Biological Sciences. \nThe set of Program Name Changes and Program Suspension submitted reflects this \ndepartmental-wide consolidation of seven honors/specialization programs (Animal \nBiology, Ecology, Evolutionary Biology, Molecular Genetics, Microbiology, Physiology \nand Developmental Biology, and Plant Biology) to three:  \n(1) Ecology, Evolution and Environmental Biology (newly proposed name for Ecology); \n(2) Integrative Physiology (newly proposed name for Physiology and Developmental \nBiology); and \n(3) Molecular, Cellular and Developmental Biology (newly proposed name for Molecular \nGenetics). \nSimultaneously, we propose to suspend the following honors/specialization programs: \n(1) Animal Biology \n(2) Evolutionary Biology \n(3) Microbiology \n(4) Plant Biology \nWe are not proposing changes to either of our joint programs: (1) Immunology and \nInfection (joint with Medical Microbiology and Immunology) or (2) Paleontology (joint \n1 Please note that this section entitled “Summary of Suite of Program Changes in the Department of Biological” is repeated \nin seven documents submitted at same time: Animal Biology Suspension, Ecology Name Change, Evolutionary Biology \nSuspension, Microbiology Suspension, Molecular Genetics Name Change, Physiology and Developmental Biology Name \nChange, and Plant Biology Suspension. \n3 \nwith Department of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences).  Nor are we proposing any changes \nto the General Biological Sciences Major. \nThese changes result in programs that have broad appeal, provide greater flexibility, and \naccurately describe program learning outcomes and content.  We are not changing the core \nrequirements of any of the three newly named programs but rather highlighting expanded \nlistings of course choices to meet the learning outcomes of the programs. All programs \ncontinue to share a common set of first year course requirements.  \nAll students in suspended programs will be given the opportunity to complete their \nprograms. For those students who are interested in these suspended programs, all of them \nare fully captured in the three renamed programs. Depending on interests, there is one of \nthe newly named programs that is a natural fit, for others, there may be more than one of \nthe newly named programs that would work. For example, Evolutionary Biology has \nalways been an integral part of the Ecology program. Similarly, Microbiology and Plant \nBiology courses were incorporated into and remain key to our Molecular, Cellular and \nDevelopmental Biology Programs (newly proposed name for Molecular Genetics \nPrograms). Students interested in the Plant Biology and Microbiology programs will just as \neasily fit in the Ecology, Evolution and Environmental Biology Programs (newly proposed \nname for Ecology Programs) if they are more interested how these organisms evolve and \ninteract in their environment than their molecular basis. Along these veins, all three newly \nnamed programs would fulfill goals of students interested in Animal Biology, depending on \nwhether they wanted to focus on their physiology, their ecology and evolution, or their \nmolecular and cellular processes.  \nThis consolidation of programs also permits students to explore more of the large and \ndiverse Department of Biological Sciences offerings. If they discover an unexpected \ninterest (ie, genetics students discovering love for plant biology), they are now able to more \neasily take additional courses in that area without having to formally change programs. \nSwitching programs often results in students taking an extra term or extra year to complete \nrequirements. Similarly, students who have identified and maintain a particular fascination \n(e.g., animal biology) will have the direction to take classes that provide substantial depth \nof knowledge in that discipline. The consolidated course listings within the three renamed \nprograms makes them less restrictive for undergraduate students, thus taking perhaps \noverly complicated programs to ones that provide more choice. The learning outcomes, \ncore requirements, rigor, depth, and excellence of our programs remain the same.  \nFurther, the newly structured programs maintain and increase the flexibility for students to \nparticipate in the Science Internship Program (SIP) and/or completion of the Research \nCertificate in Science (Biological Sciences). These two opportunities are aligned with the \nUniversity of Alberta’s new Institutional Strategic Plan “For the Public Good” that sets out \nto increase access to internships and support for excellence in teaching, particularly \nexperiential learning, as objectives. \n4 \nThis restructuring was initiated at a Department of Biological Sciences Executive Retreat \nin November 2014, wherein we challenged ourselves to reexamine our undergraduate \nprograms as though they were new rather than products of historical departments. The \nproposed restructuring was then discussed and/or voted on at three departmental council \nmeetings (15 April 2015, 9 December 2015, 10 February 2016).  Further, we facilitated \ndepartment-wide discussion of changes via two avenues. First, we developed a \ndepartmental website that included our student survey (see below) and proposed changes to \nour programs. Second, we coordinated three informal meetings to which our invested \nstakeholders attended and discussed changes to our newly named programs (30 November \n2015, 1 December 2015, 4 December 2015).  \nImportantly, students also support this restructuring. In March 2015, we conducted an \nanonymous online survey of our Biological Sciences students. We also led three focal \nmeetings with groups of students including students registered in our honors/specialization \nprograms and in the general program (two on 27 March 2015, one on 30 March 2015). Of \nthe 554 respondents to the online survey, 192 were in our honor/specialization programs (= \n44% of total students enrolled in the honors/specialization programs) and 353 were in the \nGeneral Biological Sciences Program (= 23% of the total number of students in the General \nProgram). The majority of these respondents (71%) stated that our seven \nhonors/specialization programs have limited (which allowed us to determine which \nprograms to maintain) and strong (which allowed us to determine which programs to \nsuspend) overlap. Similarly, students indicated that having three honors/specialization \nprograms versus seven was acceptable (29%), slightly acceptable (26%), neutral (20%), \nslightly unacceptable (18%), and unacceptable (7%).  In sum, 75% of the students surveyed \neither accepted or were neutral about the consolidation to three honors/specialization \nprograms. A few comments regarding these changes are provided here: \n● “I actually quite like the idea of three overarching areas of study. It makes decision-\nmaking easier and less overwhelming while still maintaining the aspect of choice.” \n● “It is confusing distinguishing between the many different programs.” \n● “It can be a little bit overwhelming differentiating between all of the programs.” \n● “There is so much overlap between all of the biological sciences programs – \nespecially between different ‘animal related’/‘plant’/‘ecology’ related programs that \neven though there are quite a few different programs offered, the overlap effectively \nreduces the number of programs offered because they’re all so similar.” \n● “I feel as though the programs that exist are not easily understandable.” \nConversely, a small minority opinion is that the focus of seven programs provides \nappropriate depth for students who have a passion in one of these areas (e.g., Microbiology, \nPlant Biology). We greatly appreciate these concerns and will ameliorate them in three \nways. First, we will effectively use our departmental website to help students choose \ncourses that meet degree requirements and emphasize particular subdisciplines by \nidentifying informal streams within newly named programs. Second, we will maintain our \n5 \nset of faculty advisors who can actively help students identify interests and understand \nappropriate course sequences to achieve their academic goals. Finally, we are not changing \nour course offerings, such that with few minor exceptions all of our current courses are still \navailable to our students. In other words, all newly named programs accommodate these \ninterests. \nRationale for name change of Molecular Genetics Programs \nThe name Molecular, Cellular and Developmental Biology accurately reflects the goals and \noutcomes of this program. Molecular genetics is a somewhat outdated term for a broad \nfield investigating the underlying molecular and genetic mechanisms of biological and \ncellular processes. Moreover, it does not appropriately reflect the broad range of \nspecialized disciplines that our courses and instructors offer, including molecular biology, \ngenetics, genomics, bioinformatics, cell biology, developmental biology, microbiology, and \nmolecular plant sciences. Thus, this broader name more accurately captures the breadth of \nknowledge emphasized through this degree and reflects the academic preparation we \nprovide our students for a variety of career opportunities. \nThe newly named Molecular, Cellular, and Developmental Biology Programs have \nequivalent training in genetics, microbiology, and molecular plant sciences in the first two \nyears of the program. This increase in breadth in the newly named Molecular, Cellular, and \nDevelopmental Biology Programs was achieved by requiring a single additional course to \nthe second year: Fundamentals of Plant Biology (BOT 205).  \nMicrobiology was always an integral component of these programs as were upper division \nplant biology courses. For years three and four, undergraduate students can continue to mix \nthese interests or choose to follow courses that emphasize genetics, microbiology, or plants. \nAgain we emphasize that these options were previously available in the Molecular Genetics \nprograms, but now they have been highlighted by re-organizing the lists of courses and \nincreasing the number of approved science options. In other words, the course lists (from \nwhich students choose a set number to complete to meet their program requirements) were \nrearranged to provide greater flexibility. \nWe re-iterate that the core of the Molecular Genetics honors and specialization programs \nhas not been altered. Rather the restructured programs offer students different pathways to \nunderstand general molecular and cellular processes across a range of taxa. Regardless of \nwhether students study animals, microbes, plants or a combination, they will gain an \nunderstanding of the different physical, chemical, and molecular processes that occur in \nand between cells. They will also learn about the significant molecular and cell-based \nmethods used to expand our fundamental understanding of chemical, molecular, and \ncellular processes that take place in animals, microbes and plants.   \nThe incorporation of cellular and developmental biology with genetics is generally \nmirrored with other institutions in Campus Alberta that offer BSc in Biology, although \nthere is wide variation in names of Biology degrees in the province. MacEwan University \noffers a general program in Biology with two streams (comparable stream to our newly \n6 \nnamed program is molecular/cellular biology).  The University of Calgary offers programs \nin Cellular, Molecular and Microbial Biology. The following Albertan institutions have \ngeneral degrees in Biology without further formal subdivisions (similar to MacEwan): \nConcordia University, University of Lethbridge, Mount Royal University, and St. Mary’s \nUniversity. \nThis new program name more closely aligns with trends in larger Canadian institutions, \nalthough we must emphasize the breadth of science that Biological Sciences encompasses, \nproviding many opportunities for division. University of British Columbia offers BSc \ndegrees in Cell and Developmental Biology.  The Department of Cell and Systems \nBiology, University of Toronto, offers programs in (a) Cell and Molecular Biology \n(specialist and Major options), (b) Genome biology (major), and (c) Developmental \nbiology (specialist). The University of Manitoba offers a program in Cell, Molecular, and \nDevelopmental Biology. Queens University suggests a Genetic and Molecular Biology \nStream through their Department of Biology. McMaster University offers an honors \nprogram in Molecular Biology and Genetics. The University of Regina offers programs in \nCellular and Molecular Biology.   \n4. Impacts on students (active, stop-outs, graduates) and plans to ameliorate these impacts.  \nInclude evidence of consultation with students, as well as plans to allow active students the \nopportunity to graduate with the established credential (should they wish), and plans to deal \nwith graduates of the program coming forward to request an exchange of their credential \nfor the new. \nThe first year of the program is unchanged and common to all our honors and \nspecialization programs. All the courses listed in the Molecular Genetics honors and \nspecialization programs are listed in the newly named Molecular, Cellular and \nDevelopmental honors and specialization programs with one exception that now BOT 205 \nis added as a required course. All other required courses are simply re-arranged into more \nflexible course lists that include a broader range of options. As such, the depth of the \nprograms remains unchanged, but does provide more options for students who want \nbreadth across different taxa. In sum, there is no impact on content and quality of the \nprograms and the core and focus remains unchanged. We have simply broadened our \nexisting lists to provide more options and more flexibility. \n5. Provide evidence of consultation with relevant external stakeholders, for instance \nemployers, professional/regulatory organizations or other post-secondary institutions.  \nIdentify anticipated impacts on stakeholder groups (if any) and outline plans to ameliorate \nimpacts. \nJennifer Sipkens, Executive Director, Alberta Society of Professional Biologists was \nconsulted about all proposed changes to our programs, including all proposed name \nchanges and suspensions. Because requirements for membership are based on total number \n7 \nof courses, not specific program, these changes will not affect this organization or our \nstudents’ eligibility to apply for Professional Biologist status.  \nProposed name changes were presented at ACAT Sciences Articulation Committee 9 May \n2016. No concerns were voiced. Attendees included representatives from Ambrose \nUniversity, Univ. of Lethbridge, MacEwan, Grand Prairie Regional College, Lakeland \nCollege, Mount Royale Univ., Red Deer College, Univ. of Alberta, Univ. of Calgary, \nMedicine Hat College, and St. Mary’s University.  ACAT secretariats (Clare Ard and Eric \nDohei) and Caroline Nixon from Alberta Education were also in attendance. \n6. Identify anticipated impacts on relevant units within the institution (e.g. Registrar’s Office, \nCommunications) and summarize the implications of the proposed change for institutional \nresources. \nThe proposed name change to the degree title for honors and specialization will not impact \nthe number of students admitted to the Faculty of Science either by an increase or decrease. \nThe proposed name change may increase the number of students admitted to the honors \nand specialization program given that change occurs with subsequent proposed suspensions \nof other programs (Animal Biology, Evolutionary Biology, Microbiology and Plant \nBiology). We will monitor the impact of names change on demand for the degree.  \nThe Department of Biological Sciences and the Faculty of Science will revise the records \nand documents under their respective control to incorporate the new degree name. These \nwill include, but are not limited to, Departmental and Faculty forms and Departmental and \nFaculty websites. The University will revise records and documents under its control, \nincluding the University website and University publications.  If approved, we will \nundertake the formal procedures to revise references to the program in the University \nCalendar and any University policy or procedure that references or mentions the Molecular \nGenetics Program. These changes will be advertised in the University Calendar for one \nyear before implementation. The costs associated with these revisions would not result in \nany new expenses for the Faculty or the University as they would be absorbed in existing \nbudgets, which take into account revision of forms, websites, and ongoing calendar \nchanges. \nThe proposed degree name changes will affect the Office of the Registrar in two contexts. \nFirst, changes will need to be made to degree codes, program codes and application \nprocesses.  The costs associated with these revisions would not result in any new expenses \nfor the Faculty or the University as they would be absorbed in existing budgets. Second, \nstudents who begin the first year of the program in the year that the degree title changes \nwill graduate with a BSc Specialization and Honors in Molecular, Cellular and \nDevelopmental Biology.  Students further along in their programs will be permitted to \nchoose which program name appears on their Degree Parchment, either Molecular Genetics \nor Molecular, Cellular and Developmental Biology. Students who choose the former name \n8 \nof Molecular Genetics would have 5 years to complete their programs with this name \navailable for their Degree Parchment. The Department of Biological Sciences and the \nFaculty of Science will communicate with enrolled students about their choices for which \nname of program would be listed on degree parchment. \n1 \nProposal Template: Program/Specialization Name Changes \nThis template is for the presentation of proposals to change the title of an existing program or \nspecialization within an existing program.

The proposed changes to consolidate our undergraduate honors \nand specialization programs will enhance undergraduate student experiences and more \naccurately communicate the breadth, strengths and focus of the Biological Sciences \nprograms. We are a large and diverse department that provides substantive experiential \nlearning, however the size of our department can pose challenges for undergraduate \nstudents trying to choose our programs or discern differences amongst the breadth of \ndisciplines. We currently offer seven honors and seven specialization programs, which \nmostly reflected outdated boundaries of departments that were merged into a larger \nBiological Sciences Department over 20 years ago. The proposed changes avoid taxonomic \ndesignations (e.g., Animal Biology, Plant Biology) and more appropriately reflect broader \nareas in Biological Sciences, rather than revolve content around specific organisms that \nmay be used to study these important disciplines. The outcome of this re-evaluation is a \nreduction in our total number of programs, while still providing students with an exemplary \neducation that reflects appropriate depth and breadth to meet the challenges of changing \nand broad career opportunities in the Biological Sciences. \nThe set of Program Name Changes and Program Suspension submitted reflects this \ndepartmental-wide consolidation of seven honors/specialization programs (Animal \nBiology, Ecology, Evolutionary Biology, Molecular Genetics, Microbiology, Physiology \nand Developmental Biology, and Plant Biology) to three:  \n(1) Ecology, Evolution and Environmental Biology (newly proposed name for Ecology); \n(2) Integrative Physiology (newly proposed name for Physiology and Developmental \nBiology); and \n(3) Molecular, Cellular and Developmental Biology (newly proposed name for Molecular \nGenetics). \nSimultaneously, we propose to suspend the following honors/specialization programs: \n(1) Animal Biology \n(2) Evolutionary Biology \n(3) Microbiology \n(4) Plant Biology \nWe are not proposing changes to either of our joint programs: (1) Immunology and \nInfection (joint with Medical Microbiology and Immunology) or (2) Paleontology (joint \n1 Please note that this section entitled “Summary of Suite of Program Changes in the Department of Biological” is repeated \nin seven documents submitted at same time: Animal Biology Suspension, Ecology Name Change, Evolutionary Biology \nSuspension, Microbiology Suspension, Molecular Genetics Name Change, Physiology and Developmental Biology Name \nChange, and Plant Biology Suspension. \n3 \nwith Department of Earth and Atmospheric Sciences).  Nor are we proposing any changes \nto the General Biological Sciences Major. \nThese changes result in programs that have broad appeal, provide greater flexibility, and \naccurately describe program learning outcomes and content.

These two opportunities are aligned with the \nUniversity of Alberta’s new Institutional Strategic Plan “For the Public Good” that sets out \nto increase access to internships and support for excellence in teaching, particularly \nexperiential learning, as objectives. \n4 \nThis restructuring was initiated at a Department of Biological Sciences Executive Retreat \nin November 2014, wherein we challenged ourselves to reexamine our undergraduate \nprograms as though they were new rather than products of historical departments.

In March 2015, we conducted an \nanonymous online survey of our Biological Sciences students. We also led three focal \nmeetings with groups of students including students registered in our honors/specialization \nprograms and in the general program (two on 27 March 2015, one on 30 March 2015). Of \nthe 554 respondents to the online survey, 192 were in our honor/specialization programs (= \n44% of total students enrolled in the honors/specialization programs) and 353 were in the \nGeneral Biological Sciences Program (= 23% of the total number of students in the General \nProgram). The majority of these respondents (71%) stated that our seven \nhonors/specialization programs have limited (which allowed us to determine which \nprograms to maintain) and strong (which allowed us to determine which programs to \nsuspend) overlap.

Finally, we are not changing \nour course offerings, such that with few minor exceptions all of our current courses are still \navailable to our students. In other words, all newly named programs accommodate these \ninterests. \nRationale for name change of Physiology and Developmental Biology Programs \nIntegrative Physiology is a more accurate name than Physiology and Developmental \nBiology for our honors and specialization programs. The honors and specialization \nprograms in Physiology and Developmental Biology provide a foundation of physiological \nprinciples and their application to the functioning of wide range of organisms. However, it \nis the emphasis on the range of taxa that is particularly important to capture in the proposed \nname, wherein students take courses not only focusing on many groups of vertebrates, but \nalso insects, microbes, and plants.  \nThe proposed name further differentiates our programs from the honors program in \nPhysiology, offered by the Department of Physiology in the Faculty of Medicine and \nDentistry through the Faculty of Science, which is focused on human physiology with the \ngoal of students potentially pursuing health-related careers. In sum, Integrative Physiology \nis a more accurate term for our programs that incorporate knowledge across physiological \nlevels of organization (molecular, cellular, organ, and organism), span many taxonomic \ngroups, and examine how internal and external environmental factors affect physiology. \nThe first year of this program remains unchanged and the second through fourth years were \nslightly restructured to reflect the breadth described above and, more importantly, provide \nstudents more flexible course options to pursue in the latter years of their degree. The \nsecond year course lists (from which students choose a set number to complete to meet \ntheir program requirements) were slightly modified to encourage broader interest in \ninvertebrates, microbiology, and plants. For students who are most interested in vertebrate \nphysiology, the requirements for year 2 are unchanged. In addition, courses were added to \nlists for years 3 and 4 to provide students with more options to pursue potential interests in \nplants and insects, while still maintaining our established focus on vertebrate physiology.  \nWe re-iterate that these options were previously available in programs, but now they have \nbeen highlighted by re-organizing the lists of courses and increasing the number of \napproved science options.  \nSimilar to our currently named program, there are few to no comparators across Alberta for \nour newly proposed name of Integrative Physiology, highlighting the value and breadth of \nprograms we offer through our department. There is substantial variation in names of \nBiology degrees in the province. MacEwan University offers a general program in Biology \nwith two streams, neither of which emphasizes physiology. The University of Calgary \noffers diverse programs, none of which align with a physiological emphasis. The following \nAlbertan institutions have general degrees in Biology without further formal divisions \n6 \n(similar to MacEwan): Concordia University, University of Lethbridge, Mount Royal \nUniversity, and St. Mary’s University. \nThis new program name more closely aligns with trends at larger Canadian institutions, \nalthough we must emphasize the breadth of science that Biological Sciences encompasses, \nproviding many opportunities for division and lack of direct comparators. The University \nof British Columbia offers BScs in Cellular, Anatomical and Physiological Sciences \n(emphasis is in human physiology, though, and not a direct comparison). The Department \nof Cell and Systems Biology, University of Toronto, offers programs in (a) Animal \nPhysiology and (b) Physiology. The University of Manitoba offers programs in (a) \nEnvironmental and Integrative Physiology and (b) Integrative Biology. Neither Queens \nUniversity nor the University of Regina lists specific physiological streams through their \nrespective Departments of Biology.  McMaster University offers an honors program with \nPhysiology Specialization.  \n4. Impacts on students (active, stop-outs, graduates) and plans to ameliorate these impacts.  \nInclude evidence of consultation with students, as well as plans to allow active students the \nopportunity to graduate with the established credential (should they wish), and plans to deal \nwith graduates of the program coming forward to request an exchange of their credential \nfor the new. \nThe first year of the program remains completely unchanged and common to all our honors \nand specialization programs. All the courses listed in the Physiology and Developmental \nBiology honors and specialization programs are listed in the Integrative Physiology honors \nand specialization programs. The course lists have been expanded to provide additional \napproved courses. As such, the depth of the programs remains unchanged, but does provide \nmore options for students who want additional breadth. In sum, there is no impact on \ncontent and quality of the programs and the core and focus remains unchanged. We simply \nbroadened our existing lists to provide more options and more flexibility. \nFirst, we will effectively use our departmental website to help students choose courses that \nmeet degree requirements and emphasize particular subdisciplines by identifying informal \nstreams. Second, we will maintain our set of faculty advisors who can actively help \nstudents identify interests and understand appropriate courses sequences to achieve their \nacademic goals. Finally, we are not changing our course offerings, such that with few \nminor exceptions all of our current courses are still available to our students.  \n5. Provide evidence of consultation with relevant external stakeholders, for instance \nemployers, professional/regulatory organizations or other post-secondary institutions.  \nIdentify anticipated impacts on stakeholder groups (if any) and outline plans to ameliorate \nimpacts. \n7 \nJennifer Sipkens, Executive Director, Alberta Society of Professional Biologists was \nconsulted about all proposed changes to our programs, including all proposed name \nchanges and suspensions. Because requirements for membership are based on total number \nof courses, not specific program, these changes will not affect this organization or our \nstudents’ eligibility to apply for Professional Biologist status.  \nProposed name changes were presented at ACAT Sciences Articulation Committee 9 May \n2016. No concerns were voiced. Attendees included representatives from Ambrose \nUniversity, Univ. of Lethbridge, MacEwan, Grand Prairie Regional College, Lakeland \nCollege, Mount Royale Univ., Red Deer College, Univ. of Alberta, Univ. of Calgary, \nMedicine Hat College, and St. Mary’s University.  ACAT secretariats (Clare Ard and Eric \nDohei) and Caroline Nixon from Alberta Education were also in attendance. \n6. Identify anticipated impacts on relevant units within the institution (e.g. Registrar’s Office, \nCommunications) and summarize the implications of the proposed change for institutional \nresources. \nThe proposed name change to the degree title for honors and specialization will not impact \nthe number of students admitted to the Faculty of Science either by an increase or decrease. \nThe proposed name change may increase the number of students admitted to the honors \nand specialization program given that change occurs with subsequent proposed suspensions \nof other programs (animal biology, evolutionary biology, microbiology, and plant biology). \nWe will monitor the impact of names change on demand for the degree.  \nThe Department of Biological Sciences and the Faculty of Science will revise the records \nand documents under their respective control to incorporate the new degree name. These \nwill include, but are not limited to, Departmental and Faculty forms and Departmental and \nFaculty websites. The University will revise records and documents under its control, \nincluding the University website and University publications.  If approved, we will \nundertake the formal procedures to revise references to the program in the University \nCalendar and any University policy or procedure that references or mentions the \nPhysiology and Developmental Biology Programs. These changes will be advertised in the \nUniversity Calendar for one year before implementation. The costs associated with these \nrevisions would not result in any new expenses for the Faculty or the University as they \nwould be absorbed in existing budgets, which take into account revision of forms, websites, \nand ongoing calendar changes. \nThe proposed degree name changes will affect the Office of the Registrar in two contexts. \nFirst, changes will need to be made to degree codes, program codes and application \nprocesses. The costs associated with these revisions would not result in any new expenses \nfor the Faculty or the University as they would be absorbed in existing budgets.
