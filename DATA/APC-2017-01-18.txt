In addition to the recruitment of Alberta students, other areas of focus include national high-achieving students, Aboriginal students, Francophone students, and international students. During the ensuing discussion, members expressed several comments, including the current political climate and its impact on international student applications, as well as how lower-income international students fit into the current strategy, such as those from Africa. Ms Collins provided clarification on the current strategy towards attracting Aboriginal students, and retention rates. Ms Padfield reported that applications for the current cycle look positive and gave some comparisons to the previous year.",

While some of \nour programs remain quite accessible, admission to other programs is highly competitive. Though the \nuniversity’s supply of seats in programs is relatively steady over time, demand for programs does fluctuate \nfrom year to year. Demand drivers include the economy, labour markets, and inter-institutional competition \nin provincial, national, and international applicant pools. In this environment, active management of \nenrolment is required to ensure that the university enrolls to its published targets. \nAs we work towards “build(ing) a diverse, inclusive community of exceptional students from Edmonton, \nAlberta, Canada, and the world1”, enrolment management plays a significant role in bringing those students \nto campus. The Office of the Registrar is committed to working with our partners in faculties and \nadministrative units to develop and implement strategies to support students throughout the enrolment \ncycle, from early inquiry as a prospective student to graduation and transition to alumni status.   \nWith the fourth Annual Report on Undergraduate Enrolment, we are pleased to highlight significant \nprogress. We have fundamentally changed our enrolment management processes, and we are succeeding. \nThe university’s undergraduate full-load-equivalent enrolments for 2016/17 are projected to land within one \npercent of institutional targets. As a result of the implementation of the Ten Point Plan on Undergraduate \nEnrolment Management, faculties now set and adjust admission averages throughout the enrolment cycle, \nin direct response to the size and qualifications of their applicants. As we now base admission and \nscholarship decisions on the early indicators of academic performance, students receive earlier offers. \nThese offers also have fewer conditions on them, reflecting a firmer commitment to the student. Admitted \nstudents are invited to formally commit to us by accepting their offers of admission. This provides critical \ninformation about how many seats remain open in a program as admission evaluations continue throughout \nthe cycle. The rate at which the university revokes admission offers began dropping significantly beginning \nin 2015/16, and it continues to fall. Multi-year trend data on admit rates, yield rates for admitted students, \nand mean competitive admission averages all reflect health and quality in the university’s applicant pools.  \nThe university continues to actively recruit Albertan students as our largest applicant group. Enticing high-\nachieving Albertan students to attend post-secondary education in their home province is an area of focus. \nOther priorities include Aboriginal students, rural students, Francophone students, high-achieving out-of-\nprovince students, and international students. Together, these groups form a diverse class of \nundergraduate students from a wide variety of backgrounds. We have seen important increases in the \nAboriginal applications, admissions, and enrolments, all positive signs for this high priority group. \nInternational enrolments remain stable and close to the university’s target of 15 percent, while also \nreflecting increased diversity in the international student body. \nIt is my hope that this year’s data will contribute to shared understanding and support evidence-based \ndecision making. While this report is a retrospective annual assessment, it also signals opportunity for \nfuture innovation. I look forward to what each year brings.   \nLisa Collins \nVice-Provost & University Registrar  \n1 University of Alberta Institutional Strategic Plan, For the Public Good \nAnnual Report on Undergraduate Enrolment 2016/17 2 \nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY \nThe Annual Report on Undergraduate Enrolment provides an overview of key undergraduate enrolment \nstatistics in each academic year (September 1 – August 31). Application, admission and enrolment statistics \nare collected as of December 1 each year. The 2016/17 report is the fourth such annual report issued by the \nOffice of the Registrar. The Report includes information about total enrolment, expressed in headcount, as \nwell as enrolment expressed by post-secondary institutions in the Province of Alberta as Full Load \nEquivalents (FLEs). In addition to tracking total enrolment, the report looks at three specific areas: \n1. Student intake: applications, admissions, and registrations, including selectivity and yield rates; \n2. Basic demographic data about the student body, and key populations within it; \n3.

The 2016 yield rate of 67 percent \nis significant in that it represents the first time the university has seen an increase in yield in seven years. \nMean admission averages for undergraduate direct entry programs experienced improvement relative to \nthe past several academic years, reflecting an overall improvement in the quality of our applicant pool. \nAdmission offer revocation rates continued their downward trend and fell even further to 2 percent, \nconfirming that recent improvements to enrolment processes are beneficial to both the university and \nstudents.  \nInternational \nTop source countries, by last \nschool location \nChina: \n55% \nCanada: \n23% \nIndia: \n2% \nMalaysia: 1%, Brazil: 1%, Saudi Arabia: 1%, \nJapan: 1%, Nigeria: 1% \nTotal country citizenship in \ninternational headcount \n102 Three countries (China, India, Nigeria) each having 100 or more \nstudents within the population. \nAnnual Report on Undergraduate Enrolment 2016/17 3 \nThe 2016/17 international undergraduate ratio continues in its steady state of 14 percent, same as the \nprevious two years, which is close to the institutional target of 15 percent of total undergraduate enrolment. \nWhile China continues to remain the top citizenship country of our international students, the proportion of \nstudents with Chinese citizenship in total international enrolment decreased by 2 percent. This marks the \nfirst time in at least six years that the proportion of students with Chinese citizenship has decreased rather \nthan increased, this trend aligns with the institutional goal of increasing international diversity.  \nDomestic \nOrigin of undergraduates – based on \npermanent home address \n% of \nheadcount \nEdmonton & area 49%  \nRest of Alberta 25%  \nCanada (excluding Alberta) 9% Notably British Columbia, Saskatchewan and Ontario \nOutside of Canada 17%  \nDomestic student headcount represents 86 percent of our total undergraduate headcount, which is similar \nto the ratios for the two previous years. Although 86 percent of our students are domestic, only 84 percent \nof all students have permanent home address in Canada with the remainder 16 percent having permanent \naddresses outside of Canada. This suggests that some of our domestic students come from outside of \nCanada in much the same way as some international students come from within Canada.  \nAboriginal Enrolment \nTotal Aboriginal enrolment 1,012   \nTotal Aboriginal applicants 1,038 New Aboriginal applicants 744 \nTotal Aboriginal applicants admitted 664 Total new Aboriginal applicants admitted 447 \nMany gains were achieved in 2016/17 in the Aboriginal enrolment group. Undergraduate Aboriginal \nenrolment increased significantly, with a 9.6 percent increase in self-identified Aboriginal students. This \nyear also saw significant increases in Aboriginal application and admission, with a 16 percent and 18 \npercent increase, respectively, from the previous year. These numbers comprise new-to-university \napplicants as well as continuing students applying for program change. The number of new-to-university \nAboriginal applicants increased by 20 percent, representing the largest yearly increase in new Aboriginal \napplicants since 2011. 60 percent of new-to-university Aboriginal applicants were admitted.

TOTAL UNDERGRADUATE ENROLMENT  \n1.1 ENROLMENT HEADCOUNT \nSince 2012/13, undergraduate enrolment has declined annually by one to two percent to reach 30,626 \nstudents in 2015/16. The yearly decline was a result of deliberate efforts to manage enrolment down to \npublished targets as at least five faculties had been over enrolled. The total undergraduate headcount of \n30,626 for 2015/16 was associated with an average of 0.3 percent over enrolment across faculties. At the \nsame time, four faculties were moderately under enrolled, mainly because of a contraction in application \nvolume. In 2016/17 total headcount increased to 30,851, due partly to the correction of under enrolment in \ntwo of four faculties and partly, to a stronger application volume along with a moderate increase in yield \nrates, resulting in mild over enrolment in some faculties.   \nFigure 1: Enrolment Headcount (2011 to 2016)   \nSource: Office of the Registrar, December 1 REGSTATS Archive \nNote: Undergraduate headcount includes Postgraduate Medical and Dental Education \n7,474\t 7,598\t 7,664\t 7,572\t 7,204\t\n7,458\t\n31,300\t 31,904\t 31,648\t 31,161\t 30,626\t\n30,851\t\n-\n5,000\t\n10,000\t\n15,000\t\n20,000\t\n25,000\t\n30,000\t\n35,000\t\n2011/12 2012/13 2013/14 2014/15 2015/16 2016/17\nGraduate Undergraduate\nAnnual Report on Undergraduate Enrolment 2016/17 5 \n1.2 NEW AND CONTINUING REGISTRATION, UNDERGRADUATE HEADCOUNT  \nTotal undergraduate registration is comprised of “new to program” intake (applicants registered) and \ncontinuing students (continuing registered).

Students who are auditing \ncourses may be included in Applicants Registered but are excluded from Total Registered. Also, continuing students who had \nwithdrawn from all their classes over the past four terms but are registered in the current term would be counted in Total \nRegistered but neither in Applicant Registered nor Continuing Registered. \n3. Data shown for 2015 would differ from those shown in 2015 Annual Report as the current data no longer includes students in the \nCareer Preparation Diploma program of Faculté Saint-Jean. The University is now able to record the Career Preparation Program \nheadcounts distinctly from undergraduates.  \n4. Applicant and admission numbers shown here are based on the ‘applicant indicator’ method of sorting applicants into faculties. \nAlthough each applicant may have applied to (or been admitted in) more than one program, each applicant is placed only in their \nmain faculty (based on their revealed preference or registration). Therefore the number of applicants shown here for each program \nwould be less than the total number of applications received by the program. However, the aggregate number of applicants across \nall programs would balance out with the institutional total.   \n5. Numbers shown for Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences include BSc Pharmacy as well as the Doctor of Pharmacy program \nwhich is considered as an undergraduate program.  \nAnnual Report on Undergraduate Enrolment 2016/17 6 \n1.3 ENROLMENT FULL LOAD EQUIVALENT, UNDERGRADUATE \nFor 2016/17, the university had an overall undergraduate enrolment target of 26,535 Full Load Equivalents \n(FLEs). Total FLEs realized is estimated at 26,257 suggesting a near full enrolment at 99 percent of target. \nFaculty enrolments vary. Engineering has the largest under enrolment, estimated at 255 FLEs below target. \nAnother four faculties (Arts, Augustana, Business, Native Studies, and Science) have mild under enrolment \nranging from 4 to 132 FLEs below target. Enrolment in another nine faculties is either on target (Faculté \nSaint-Jean and Nursing) or mildly over target. A major improvement from 2015/16 to 2016/17 was the \nclosing of enrolment gaps for each of the faculties of Science and Native Studies. The Faculty of Science \nimproved to 61 FLEs (or 1.1 percent) under target having been 161 FLEs (or 2.9 percent) under in the \npreceding year. The Faculty of Native Studies improved to 4 FLEs or (3 percent) under target having been 16 \nFLEs under (or 12.5 percent) in the preceding academic year. However, the Faculty of Engineering remains \nunder enrolled as its actual student numbers have yet to increase to match its ongoing 780 FLEs ramp up in \nenrolment allocation. Therefore, there remains room to optimize enrolment within Engineering as well as \nother faculties with respect to institutional targets.  \nTable 2: 2016/2017 Enrolment by FLE and Comparison with Targets    \nProgram Faculty \n2016/17 \nFLE \nEstimate \n2016/17 \nFLE \nTarget \n2016/2017 Over/ \nUnder \nEnrolment FLE \n2015/2016 \nOver/ Under \nEnrolment FLE \n2016/17 \nOver / \nUnder  % \n2015/16 \nOver / \nUnder  % \nALES 1249 1227 22 6 1.8% 0.5% \nArts 4739 4871 -132 -68 -2.7% -1.4% \nAugustana Faculty 882 899 -17 4 -1.9% 0.5% \nBusiness 1754 1786 -32 1 -1.8% 0.1% \nEducation 2579 2551 28 -9 1.1% -0.3% \nEngineering 4085 4340 -255 -51 -5.9% -1.2% \nLaw 560 525 35 24 6.6% 4.6% \nMedicine and Dentistry 1066 1040 26 30 2.5% 2.9% \nFaculty of Native Studies 126 130 -4 -16 -3.0% -12.5% \nNursing 1356 1354 2 85 0.2% 6.1% \nOpen Studies 583 543 40 14     \nPhysical Educ & Recreation 838 800 38 21 4.7% 2.6% \nPharmacy & Pharm Science 497 467 30 13 6.5% 2.7% \nRehabilitation Medicine 2   2 3     \nFaculté Saint-Jean 515 514 1 3 0.3% 0.7% \nScience 5427 5488 -61 -161 -1.1% -2.9% \nTOTALS 26257 26535 -278 -101 -1.0% -0.38% \nAverage     -17 -6 0.5% 0.2% \nSource: Strategic Analysis and Data Warehousing, Applicant and Enrolment Management Report, Enrolment Management Table \nNotes: \n1.

However, 2016/17 saw a recovery from this decline as a total of 669 more applicants were \nrecorded in 2016/17 than in the preceding year. Total 2016/17 applicants are comparable to 2014/15 \nnumbers.  The growth in applicant numbers was almost entirely due to direct entry applicants while post-\nsecondary and internal transfer applications remained relatively stable (Sections 2.6 and 2.7).  \nFigure 4: Ten Year Undergraduate Applicant Curve  \nSource: Strategic Analysis and Data Warehousing, Applicant and Enrolment Management Report, Enrolment Management Table  \nNotes:   \n1.

This ratio is similar to 2015/16 and falls within \nhistorical admission rate of 57 to 63 percent. Admission rate is influenced by enrolment targets, quality of \nthe applicant pool, and yield rates. If applicant numbers continue to increase simultaneously as efforts are \nbeing made to attain higher yield rates and manage enrolment to targets, admission rate would have to \ndecrease so as to avoid over enrolment across programs.   \nFigure 5: Ten Year Undergraduate Admission Rate Curve \nSource: Strategic Analysis and Data Warehousing, Applicant and Enrolment Management Report, Enrolment Management Table  \nNote:  Data is based on December 1 archived data for each specified year.   \n59%\n57%\n59%\n63%\n63% 62%\n59% 57%\n59% 59%\n0%\n10%\n20%\n30%\n40%\n50%\n60%\n70%\n80%\n90%\n100%\n2007/08 2008/09 2009/10 2010/11 2011/12 2012/13 2013/14 2014/15 2015/16 2016/17\nAd\nm\niss\nio\nn\t\nRa\nte\nEnrolment\tCycle\nAnnual Report on Undergraduate Enrolment 2016/17 11 \n2.3 YIELD RATE \nYield rate is the proportion of admitted applicants who register. Yield rate had declined continuously from \n84 percent in 2009/10 to 66 percent in 2015/16. The long term decline was associated with the university \nbecoming more selective (targeting highly qualified applicants) which meant a shift towards a more \ncompetitive applicant category. Highly qualified applicants often have multiple admission offers from other \ninstitutions. Albertan applicants also have many institutional choices within the Campus Alberta system. \nReversing the long term decline in yield while maintaining a high quality of admits requires strategic \nmeasures to put the university a step ahead of top Canadian competitor institutions.  \nIn 2016/17 the university adopted an admission application deadline that was two months earlier than \nhistorical practice. This encouraged early applications and consequently allowed for a higher number of \nearly admissions. One immediate change was a small increase in yield rate from 66 percent in 2015/16 to 67 \npercent in 2016/17.  \nThere is certainly room to improve on our ability to yield high quality students, including continuing to \nimprove our understanding of the role of admission practices, the weight of various factors in the student \ndecision-making process, and the strategic use of financial supports.   \nFigure 6: Ten Year Undergraduate Yield Rate Curve \nSource: Strategic Analysis and Data Warehousing, Applicant and Enrolment Management Report, Enrolment Management Table  \nNote: Data is based on December 1 archived data for each specified year.   \n82%\n83%\n84%\n78%\n75%\n75%\n72%\n70%\n66% 67%\n0%\n10%\n20%\n30%\n40%\n50%\n60%\n70%\n80%\n90%\n2007/08 2008/09 2009/10 2010/11 2011/12 2012/13 2013/14 2014/15 2015/16 2016/17\nYi\nel\nd\t\nRa\nte\nEnrolment\tCycle\nAnnual Report on Undergraduate Enrolment 2016/17 12 \n2.4 COMPETITIVE ADMISSION AVERAGES, UNDERGRADUATE DIRECT ENTRY  \nAdmission offers into direct entry faculties are based on applicants meeting faculty-set competitive \naverages at the time of admission3. \nRelative to the preceding academic year, competitive admission averages increased in 2016/17 for four of \nthe institution’s ten direct entry faculties.

These three average categories are often positively associated with one another, so that an \nincrease in the competitive average in one category often indicates an increase in the competitive average in the other two categories. \nCompetitive Final Grade 12 admission average facilitates year-over-year comparison. \nAnnual Report on Undergraduate Enrolment 2016/17 13 \n2.5 MEAN ADMISSION AVERAGES, UNDERGRADUATE DIRECT ENTRY \nMean admission average refers to the mean of Final Grade 12 marks among all admitted direct entry \napplicants in required high school courses. It bears noting that this differs from “admission average,” as \nstudents may have been offered admission and scholarships based on earlier grade information. \nAmong the 10 direct entry faculties, 2016/17 presented the most improvement in admission averages over \nseveral past academic years. Mean 2016/17 averages among admitted applicants increased for six faculties \nrelative to the 2015/16 intake. The mean averages were steady for three other faculties but decreased for \none faculty. Also relative to 2014/15, mean admission averages increased in 2016/17 for three faculties, \nwere steady for six faculties and decreased for one faculty. Averages increased for seven faculties relative \nto 2013/14.  \nThe increments observed in mean admission averages indicate an overall improvement in the \ncompetitiveness of programs relative to the preceding years. The simultaneous improvement in mean \nadmission averages, competitive averages (Section 2.4) and yield rates (Section 2.3) was a very desirable \noutcome for 2016/17.   \nTable 4: Mean Averages among Admitted Applicants (2007 – 2016)  \nFaculty 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 Trend \nALES 79 79 80 81 81 81 83 85 84 83  \nArts 81 81 80 80 80 80 81 82 81 82  \nAugustana  79 79 79 79 79 79 79 80 79 80  \nEducation           79 82 80 80 81  \nEngineering 87 87 87 87 87 87 89 90 90 90  \nNative Studies 74 75 73 71 74 77 76 75 74 75  \nNursing 82 82 82 81 81 82 84 85 86 87  \nPER 80 80 80 81 82 83 83 84 83 84  \nFaculté Saint-Jean 80 81 79 80 80 79 80 79 81 81  \nScience 85 84 83 83 84 85 87 88 88 88  \nSource: Office of the Registrar  \nAnnual Report on Undergraduate Enrolment 2016/17 14 \n2.6 APPLICANT YIELD, UNDERGRADUATE DIRECT ENTRY \nDirect entry applicant numbers followed the long term increasing trend to reach 15,595 persons in 2016/17, \nrepresenting 659 and 486 persons over the applicant counts for 2015/16 and 2014/15 respectively. A total of \n9,647 (or 62 percent) of the 2016/17 applicants were admitted while a total of 4,925 (or 51 percent) of \nadmitted applicants registered.

Both admission and yield rates represented one percentage point increases over the \n2015/16 rates.    \nUnlike direct entry applicant volume which has exhibited a strong growth trend over the years (Section 2.6), \nthe post-secondary applicant curve has remained relatively flat. The steady number of post-secondary \napplicants suggests that almost all of the 669 person growth in overall applicant numbers (Section 2.1) was \ndue to high school applicants (Section 2.6)4.  \nFigure 8: Post-Secondary Transfer Applicant, Admission and Registration Numbers (2011 – 2016)   \nSource: Strategic Analysis and Data Warehousing, Applicant and Enrolment Management Report \nNote:  Data in the above chart does NOT include Internal Transfer applicants. \n4 High school applicants grew by 659 persons, post-secondary applicants grew by 45 persons and internal transfer applicants declined \nby 35 persons.

A recent UCAS5 study by \nAcademica (2016) indicates academic reputation, overall attractiveness of our campuses, as well as \ndistance from the applicant’s home are additional factors influencing an applicant’s choice of institution and \nprogram.  \nThe impact of admission timing on yield continues to be of interest. In 2016/17, domestic applicants who \nwere admitted in the early part of the cycle showed higher yield rates than those who were admitted at the \nlater part of the cycle. Admission timing did not have any significant impact on yield among international \napplicants. The university continues to place a high priority on extending early offers to eligible applicants in \nan effort to improve the applicant experience.  \nFigure 9: Yield Rate by Month of Admission among High School Applicants (2016/17 Admission Cycle)   \nSource: Office of the Registrar \n5 University of Alberta University/College Applicant Study, 2016, Academica Group \nAnnual Report on Undergraduate Enrolment 2016/17 17 \n2.9 ADMISSION AVERAGES AND YIELD RATE, UNDERGRADUATE DIRECT ENTRY  \nFor the Fall 2016 enrolment cycle, yield rates were higher among applicants with lower admission averages \nthan among those with higher averages. This negative correlation between applicant admission averages \nand yield was much like what was observed in the preceding enrolment cycle. Also similar to the preceding \ncycle, Fall 2016 admission averages had a stronger negative effect on yield than admission timing.  \nFigure 10: Yield Rate by Admission Average Band among High School Applicants (2015/16 Admission Cycle)   \nSource: Office of the Registrar  \nAnnual Report on Undergraduate Enrolment 2016/17 18 \n2.10   ADMISSION REVOCATION RATES, UNDERGRADUATE DIRECT ENTRY \nUp to and including 2014/15, applicants were offered early conditional admission but were also required to \nmaintain a competitive average in order to retain the offer. Students who did not meet the requirements had \ntheir offers revoked. As a result, offer revocation rates had routinely been as high as 15 percent in some \nfaculties. Students with revoked offers previously reported distress about having their offers revoked, \nparticularly when those revocations occurred late in the enrolment cycle, after they had made plans to \nattend.   \nBeginning from 2015/16, all faculties except Engineering made a policy change that allowed extension of \nfirm offers of admission by meeting a competitive average based on Grade 11 marks, a combination of \nGrade 11 and Grade 12, or Final Grade 12 marks. Therefore, overall direct entry revocation rate fell \ndramatically to three percent in 2015/16, resulting in increased predictability for students. In 2016/17, \noverall direct entry revocation rate fell even further to 2 percent. Revocation rates vary by faculty - 2016/17 \nrevocation rates ranged from 0.7 percent for Augustana to 6.1 percent for the Faculty of Engineering. \nFigure 11: Direct Entry Admission Revocation Rates (2014 – 2016)   \nSource: Office of the Registrar \n9%\n3%\n2%\n0%\n2%\n4%\n6%\n8%\n10%\n2014/15 2015/16 2016/17\nAdmission\tRevocation\tRate\nAugustana\nScience\nArts\nALES\nNursing\nPhys.\tEd\t&\tRecreation.\nNative\tStudies\nEducation\nFaculté\tSaint\tJean\nEngineering\n0.7%\n1.0%\n1.1%\n1.1%\n1.5%\n1.7%\n2.0%\n2.1%\n4.2%\n6.1%\n2016\tRevocation\tRate\tby\tFaculty\t\nAnnual Report on Undergraduate Enrolment 2016/17 19 \n3. INTERNATIONAL UNDERGRADUATE ENROLMENT \n3.1 INTERNATIONAL ENROLMENT HEADCOUNT, UNDERGRADUATE \nIt is the university’s goal for international undergraduate enrolment to reach 15 percent of total enrolment. \nThe 2016/17 international undergraduate ratio of 14 percent maintains a steady state from the last two \nyears. Although total new-to-university6 international applicants and admission had increased by 400 and \n377 persons respectively over the previous enrolment cycle, new international registration only increased \nby 116 students, while continuing registration among international students decreased by 60. Overall, the \nsimultaneous growth in domestic headcount (Section 4.1) has kept the international ratio steady at 14 \npercent.  \nFigure 12: International Enrolment Headcounts and Proportions in Total Enrolment (2011 to 2016)   \nSource: Office of the Registrar, December 1 REGSTATS Archive \nNotes: \n1.

The 71 percent proportion of students with Chinese citizenship \nrepresents a 2 percent decrease from previous year. This marks the first time in at least six years that the \nproportion of students with Chinese citizenship has decreased rather than increased. This shift is in line \nwith the institutional goal of increasing international diversity.  \nThe decrease in the proportion of Chinese citizens can be attributed primarily to small increases in the \nproportions of citizens from India, Nigeria, Malaysia and Bangladesh.  \nAnother clear trend in citizenship distribution among our international students is the progressive decrease \nin the proportion of students from the Republic of Korea, falling from 5 percent in 2011/12 down to 2 \npercent in 2016/17.  \nFigure 13: Distribution of International Students by Country of Citizenship (2011 to 2016) \nSource: Office of the Registrar, December 1 REGSTATS Archive \n*Other consists of the remainder 187 international countries with each contributing one percent or less to the international student \ncounts in any specified year.  \n0%\n20%\n40%\n60%\n80%\n100%\n2011/12 2012/13 2013/14 2014/15 2015/16 2016/17\n60% 64% 68% 68%\n73% 71%\n5% 4%\n3% 3% 2% 2%3%\n3%\n23% 20% 17% 17% 16% 17%\nAcademic\tYear\nOther*\nBrazil\nJapan\nNigeria\nMalaysia\nHong\tKong\nIndia\nKorea\nChina\nAnnual Report on Undergraduate Enrolment 2016/17 21 \n3.3 TOP SOURCE COUNTRIES BY LAST SCHOOL LOCATION, UNDERGRADUATE \nFor some students, country of citizenship differs from country of last school.

Similar to the change observed for \ncountry of citizenship, the proportion with last school in China is down 2 percent from 2015/16.   \n23 percent of our 2016/17 international students came from high schools or other post-secondary \ninstitutions in Canada, 2 percent come from India, while roughly 1 percent come from schools in each of \nMalaysia, Brazil, Saudi Arabia, Japan and Nigeria.  \nSimilar to the trend observed for citizenship (Section 3.2), both the number and proportion of international \nstudent enrolling from schools in the Republic of Korea have declined progressively over the last five years, \nfrom 54 students (or 1.8 percent) in 2011/12 to 21 students (or 0.5 percent) in 2016/17. Conversely, the \nnumber and proportions of international students from schools in Nigeria have increased over the last four \nyears from 13 students (0.38 percent) in 2012/13 to 44 students (or one percent) in 2016/17. \nFigure 14: Distribution of International Students by Last School Location (2011 to 2016)  \nSource: Office of the Registrar, December 1 REGSTATS Archive \n0%\n20%\n40%\n60%\n80%\n100%\n2011/12 2012/13 2013/14 2014/15 2015/16 2016/17\n45% 49% 52% 53%\n57% 55%\n25% 25%\n24% 23%\n23% 23%\n2% 2%\n2% 2%\n2% 2%\n16% 14% 13% 13% 12% 13%\nAcademic\tYear\t\nOther\t\nNigeria\nPakistan\nUnited\tStates\nKorea\nJapan\nSaudi\tArabia\nBrazil\nMalaysia\nIndia\nCanada\nChina\nAnnual Report on Undergraduate Enrolment 2016/17 22 \n3.4 INTERNATIONAL DIVERSITY, UNDERGRADUATE ENROLMENT  \nBetween 2013/14 and 2015/16, the number of countries reflected in the citizenship of our international \nundergraduate students had declined from 111 to 102. This decline did not occur in 2016/17 as a total of 102 \ncountries are represented in the university’s 2016/17 international undergraduate enrolment. A total of 47 \ncountries have at least 5 students within the international undergraduate population while 16 countries \nhave at least 20 students. There are 3 countries (China, India and Nigeria) with 100 or more students within \nthe international undergraduate headcount for 2016/17.

DOMESTIC UNDERGRADUATE ENROLMENT  \n4.1 DOMESTIC HEADCOUNTS AND RATIOS, UNDERGRADUATE \nAs with international headcount the number of domestic undergraduates decreased mildly between 2014/15 \nand 2015/16 due to a decline in applicant numbers (Section 2.1). With the recovery of applicant numbers to \n2014/15 level, domestic enrolment in 2016/17 has also recovered and is closer to 2014/15 enrolment \nnumbers. The simultaneous growth in both domestic and international headcount means that the \nproportional mix of students by national status has not changed. The ratio of domestic headcount in total \nundergraduate enrolment remains steady at 86 percent.  \nFigure 16: Domestic Enrolment Headcounts and Proportions in Total Enrolment (2011 to 2016)\t\t\t\nSource: Office of the Registrar, December 1 REGSTATS Archive \nNotes: \n1.

Based on the number of self-identified students, total Aboriginal enrolment increased by 89 \nheadcount from the preceding academic year, reaching 1,012 students in 2016/17. The percent of Aboriginal \nenrolment in total headcount also increased from 3.01 percent to 3.28 percent. With respect to domestic \nstudents only, Aboriginal headcount constitutes 3.8 percent.  \nFrom the University Calendar, “The university recognizes that Aboriginal applicants have traditionally been \nunder represented in higher education and strives towards having the university’s Aboriginal student \npopulation attain a level that is at least proportionate to the Aboriginal population of the province.” 7 \nStatistics Canada National Household Survey of 2011 indicated that Aboriginal people comprise 6.2 percent \nof Alberta’s population. Our Institutional Strategic Plan, For the Public Good, echoes this commitment to \nengage Indigenous students and nations, with a specific strategy8 dedicated to developing and implementing \nan undergraduate recruitment and retention strategy to attract Indigenous students from across Alberta \nand Canada. \nFigure 19: Aboriginal Enrolment Headcounts and Proportions in Total Enrolment (2011 to 2016)\t\t\t\nSource: Office of the Registrar, December 1 REGSTATS Archive \nNote: Includes Postgraduate Medical and Dental Education.  \n7 2016 – 17 University Calendar > uab.ca/calendar > Undergraduate Admission >General Admission Requirements > Admission of \nAboriginal Applicants  \n8 University of Alberta Institutional Strategic Plan For the Public Good> Build > Objective 1 > Strategy 2 \n868 916 898 918 923\n1012\n0\n200\n400\n600\n800\n1000\n1200\n2011/12 2012/13 2013/14 2014/15 2015/16 2016/17\nHe\nad\nco\nun\nt\nAcademic\tYear\n2.77% 2.87% 2.84%\n2.95% 3.01%\n3.28%\nAnnual Report on Undergraduate Enrolment 2016/17 27 \n4.5 ABORIGINAL APPLICATION AND REGISTRATION TRENDS, UNDERGRADUATE \n2016/17 saw a rise in the number of Aboriginal applicants.

The proportion of our first-year undergraduates who return to same \nfaculty has grown steadily over the past eight years from 67.9 percent in 2008/09 to 73.9 percent in 2015/16.  \nIn the 2016/17, 75.3 percent of those who started their studies in the university in 2015/16 returned to their \nfirst-year faculty to continue in their program.  \nSimultaneously, the rate of transfer to a different faculty after the first year of study followed an overall \ndownward trend from 14.5 percent in 2011/12 to13 percent in 2014/15 and has remained steady at 13 \npercent in 2016/17. In other words, 13 percent of those who started their studies in the university in 2015/16 \nreturned to continue in a different program in 2016/17. \nThe overall retention rate comprised of those who returned to their previous faculty and those who \ntransferred to a different faculty. The overall first-year undergraduate retention rate has increased \ngradually during over the years, from 82.2 percent in 2008/09 to 86.9 percent in 2015/16. In 2016/17 this \nlong term increasing trend was sustained with retention reaching a ten year high of 88.3 percent.   \nThe continuous growth in first-year undergraduate retention rate indicates a steady decrease in the \nproportion of students who drop out or transfer to other universities. In 2016/17, about a third of the \nstudents withdrawing from the university were required to withdraw, the others dropped out (or transferred \nout) voluntarily.  \nFigure 22: Proportions of First-Year Undergraduates who Returned for their Second Year of Study (2007 to 2016)   \nSource: Strategic Analysis and Data Warehousing, Applicant and Enrolment Management Report, Retention Rates Table  \n70.4% 67.9% 70.1% 70.0% 70.5% 70.3% 72.2%\n73.2% 73.9% 75.3%\n13.4% 14.3% 14.0% 14.4% 14.5% 14.4% 12.7% 13.0% 13.0% 13.0%\n83.8% 82.2% 84.1% 84.4% 85.0% 84.7% 84.9% 86.2%\n86.9% 88.3%\n0.0%\n10.0%\n20.0%\n30.0%\n40.0%\n50.0%\n60.0%\n70.0%\n80.0%\n90.0%\n100.0%\n2007/08 2008/09 2009/10 2010/11 2011/12 2012/13 2013/14 2014/15 2015/16 2016/17\nRe\ntu\nrn\ned\nReport\tYear\nReturned\tto\tSame\tFaculty Returned\tto\ta\tDifferent\tFaculty\t Total\tRetention\tRate\nAnnual Report on Undergraduate Enrolment 2016/17 29 \n5.2 STUDENT RETENTION, YEAR 1 TO YEAR 2, DOMESTIC UNDERGRADUATE   \nThe trend in the first-year retention rate among domestic undergraduate students is much similar to that of \nthe overall first-year population as shown in Section 5.1. The total first-year retention rate among domestic \nstudents grew at a moderate yearly rate between 2008/09 and 2013/14, but has exhibited a much stronger \ngrowth since 2013/14, reaching a ten year high of 88.6 percent in 2016/17.  \nAmong the domestic first-year students returning to the university, an increasingly higher proportion have \nreturned in each year to their first-year faculty since 2011/12. In 2016/17, 76.5 percent of those who were \nregistered for the first time in 2015/16 returned to continue in their first-year faculty, only 12.1 percent \nreturned to a different faculty.  \nFigure 23: Proportions of First-Year Domestic Undergraduates who Returned for their Second Year of Study (2007 to 2016)   \nSource: Strategic Analysis and Data Warehousing, Applicant and Enrolment Management Report, Retention Rates Table \n71.2% 69.4% 71.3% 70.3% 71.1% 71.2% 72.8%\n74.2% 75.3% 76.5%\n12.8% 13.7% 13.3% 14.3% 13.8% 13.4% 11.7% 12.2% 12.3% 12.1%\n84.0% 83.1% 84.6% 84.6% 84.9% 84.6% 84.5% 86.4%\n87.6% 88.6%\n0.0%\n10.0%\n20.0%\n30.0%\n40.0%\n50.0%\n60.0%\n70.0%\n80.0%\n90.0%\n100.0%\n2007/08 2008/09 2009/10 2010/11 2011/12 2012/13 2013/14 2014/15 2015/16 2016/17\nRe\ntu\nrn\ned\nReport\tYear\nReturned\tto\tSame\tFaculty\t Returned\tto\ta\tDifferent\tFaculty\t Total\tRetention\tRate\nAnnual Report on Undergraduate Enrolment 2016/17 30 \n5.3 STUDENT RETENTION, YEAR 1 TO YEAR 2, INTERNATIONAL UNDERGRADUATE \nUnlike domestic first-year undergraduates as discussed in Section 5.2, retention rate among international \nfirst-year undergraduates has not followed as consistent a growth path over the past 10 years. Overall \ninternational first-year retention rate had grown steadily from 72.5 percent to 86.1 percent between 2008/09 \nand 2011/12 but have mostly showed year over year declines since 2011/12, reaching 84.1 percent in \n2015/16. The declining trend seems to have reversed in the current academic year with first-year \ninternational undergraduate retention observed at 86.7 percent in 2016/17, indicating a solid gain over \n2015/16. \nThe overall 2016/17 first-year retention rate among international students comprised of 69.4 percent \nreturning to their previous faculty and 17.3 percent returning to a different faculty.  \nFigure 24: Proportions of First-Year International Undergraduates who Returned for their Second Year of Study (2007 to 2016)   \nSource: Strategic Analysis and Data Warehousing, Applicant and Enrolment Management Report, Retention Rates Table\t\n59.1%\n52.6% 56.4%\n67.8% 65.5% 64.3%\n68.7% 68.3% 68.2% 69.4%\n22.8% 19.9% 21.1%\n15.3%\n20.6% 21.0% 18.6% 16.9% 15.9% 17.3%\n81.9%\n72.5%\n77.5%\n83.1% 86.1% 85.3% 87.3% 85.2% 84.1%\n86.7%\n0.0%\n10.0%\n20.0%\n30.0%\n40.0%\n50.0%\n60.0%\n70.0%\n80.0%\n90.0%\n100.0%\n2007/08 2008/09 2009/10 2010/11 2011/12 2012/13 2013/14 2014/15 2015/16 2016/17\nRe\ntu\nrn\ned\nReport\tYear\nReturned\tSame\tFaculty Returned\tDifferent\tFaculty\t Total\tRetention\tRate\nAnnual Report on Undergraduate Enrolment 2016/17 31 \n5.4 STUDENT RETENTION, YEAR 1 TO YEAR 2, ABORIGINAL UNDERGRADUATE  \nData on Aboriginal students is based on self-identification. As more Aboriginal students self-identify by the \nyear, their records are updated retroactively. Therefore, the Aboriginal data shown for previous years within \nthe current report differ from those shown in earlier reports. Based on the number of students who have \nself-identified at the time of this report, retention rate among first-year Aboriginal undergraduates has \nfluctuated within the range of 71.2 percent and 80.2 percent over the past ten academic years. The 2016/17 \nretention rate is 77.5 percent constituted by 68.8 percent returning to their first-year faculty and 8.7 percent \ntransferring to a different faculty. \nFigure 25: Proportions of First-Year Aboriginal Undergraduates who Returned for their Second Year of Study (2007 to 2016)   \nSource: Strategic Analysis and Data Warehousing, Applicant and Enrolment Management Report, Retention Rates Table\t\n60.0%\n69.3%\n62.0% 59.5% 62.8%\n66.5% 64.0%\n68.3% 65.3%\n68.8%\n14.1%\n8.5%\n13.4% 11.7% 9.6% 12.7% 11.1% 11.9% 12.6% 8.7%\n74.1%\n77.8% 75.4%\n71.2% 72.4%\n79.2%\n75.1%\n80.2% 77.9% 77.5%\n0.0%\n10.0%\n20.0%\n30.0%\n40.0%\n50.0%\n60.0%\n70.0%\n80.0%\n90.0%\n2007/08 2008/09 2009/10 2010/11 2011/12 2012/13 2013/14 2014/15 2015/16 2016/17\nRe\ntu\nrn\ned\nReport\tYear\nReturned\tSame\tFaculty Returned\tDifferent\tFaculty Total\tRetention\tRate\nAnnual Report on Undergraduate Enrolment 2016/17 32 \n5.5 SIX-YEAR PROGRAM COMPLETION RATES, UNDERGRADUATE DIRECT ENTRY  \nOver the past seven years, between 66.9 and 69.2 percent of the direct entry undergraduate students have \nsuccessfully graduated from the university within six years or less from the time they were first admitted. \nSix-year completion rate in 2016 is 67.9 percent representing a moderate improvement over those of the \npast three years.   \nFigure 26: Proportion of Yearly Cohorts who Graduate within Six Years of First Admission to a Direct Entry Undergraduate Program \nSource:  Strategic Analysis and Data Warehousing, Acorn Institutional Data Warehouse \nNotes:  \n1.

National Comparisons ...........................................................................................................36 \n3 \nIt is a pleasure to present the second annual report on graduate enrolment at the University of \nAlberta. Our 7,300 graduate students work in over 300 research areas with 250 official \nspecializations. Recruitment, admission and enrolment are highly decentralized, and the \ngraduate student body is rich in diversity. One third of our graduate students are international, \ncompared to 14% of our undergraduate population. Half self-identify as members of a visible \nminority group (Black, East Asian, South Asian, Southeast Asian, West Asian, Latin American or \nMixed Origin), according to the 2016 Canadian Graduate and Professional Student Survey, and \nan additional 3.7% self-identify as Aboriginal.1 Just over half of our graduate students are \nmarried (41.4% of respondents) or living with a domestic partner (11.2%). One quarter of \nUniversity of Alberta graduate students (25.8%) have at least one child. The age distribution is \nalso worth noting: \n21-25 19.3% \n26-30 35.5% \n31-35 21.6% \n36-40 9.0% \n41-45 6.1% \n45 + 8.5% \nThere is clearly no such thing as a “typical graduate student.” \nGeneralizing across such a demographically and academically differentiated landscape is risky \n– and yet the data here reaffirm the quality of our students (who consistently show high \nadmission GPAs) and the strength of our supervision (time to completion is stable, and the \nattrition rate is low by comparison with our peers, and improving).  \nWe are seeing three distinct enrolment trends at play. After reaching a historic high of over \n3,000 in 2012, doctoral enrolments are decreasing. We still have more PhD students than we \nhad in 2007, before the numbers began to climb, but we are approaching that level again. \nThesis-based Master’s enrolments are more or less stable, with last year’s low appearing \nanomalous. The real story here is course-based Master’s, which continue to surge. The \nUniversity of Alberta now has nearly 50% more course-based Master’s students than we had a \ndecade ago. Of particular note, these programs are favoured by international students (who \ncontinue to complete their degrees more quickly than domestic students) and by women, who \nnow outmatch men by a factor of nearly 2:1 in course-based streams. Women are also edging \ncloser to 50% of doctoral enrolments, and maintaining parity with men in thesis-based Master’s \nprograms.  \nThere are some significant changes to this year’s report. First, 2016 is a year of restatement. In \nlast year’s graduate enrolment report we relied on both FGSR statistics and those from the \nOffice of Strategic Analysis data warehouse. In order to ensure that this report is sustainable in \nthe future, we have made the decision to rely solely on data from the Office of Strategic \nAnalysis. In some cases, these figures differ from those that were held in the FGSR Statistics \ndatabase we used for more historical comparisons last year. This decision has resulted in some \ndifferences between the 2015-16 and 2016-17 reports, particularly in reporting time to \n1 The Canadian Graduate and Professional Student Survey is a triennial, nation-wide survey. The 2016 \nresponse rate for the University of Alberta was 25.0%. Of respondents, 59.2% were female and 40.8% \nwere male; 61.1% were Canadian, 8.5% Permanent Residents, and 30.4% indicated international status.  \n4 \ncompletion and rate of completion. We are confident that restating these figures now will ensure \naccurate long-term comparisons in years to come.  \nThe second change in this report is the inclusion of new data. In response to requests from \nreaders of last year’s report, we have provided undergraduate to graduate student ratios and \ngraduate student to professor ratios broken down by Faculty. Most importantly, we have \nincluded some U15 comparator data. As readers may be aware these data come from a data \nsharing agreement and, while there is significant effort made by consortium members to ensure \nthat the information provided is complete and comparable, we do not control the sources of this \ninformation. Finding up to date, inclusive and reliable comparator data in the graduate area \nremains a challenge. Readers may be interested to know that the Council of Graduate Schools, \nthe US-based organization, will be launching a Canadian enrolment data reporting project in \nJanuary 2017. \nBy way of a minor note, in addition to students in doctoral and master’s students, we do have a \nsmall number of students in other categories. These include qualifying, visiting and probationary \nstudents as well as people registered in post baccalaureate certificates or postgraduate \ndiplomas. The total number of such students is small and thus we have only specifically \nreported on them in the categories where it makes sense to do so. Similarly, a small number of \nstudents (73 total for the past 10 years, 23 in the period from 2012 to 2016) have the Faculty of \nGraduate Studies and Research listed as their home department. These individuals are \nincluded in total numbers of graduate students, but are not reported in Faculty-by-Faculty \nanalyses. \nFGSR welcomes the opportunity to be a key partner in strategic enrolment management and \npresents this report with great pride in our students, our supervisors and our programs. I \nappreciate the contributions of Cristiana Caramihai, Amy Dambrowitz, Gurpinder Gandhara, \nDenise Giles and Deborah Williams. I accept responsibility for any shortcomings. \nHeather Zwicker, PhD \nInterim Vice-Provost and Dean, Faculty of Graduate Studies and Research \n6 January 2017 \n5 \nIn this section, all numbers are the standard December 1st headcounts, as reported to Statistics \nCanada and the Government of Alberta. It is worth noting that this enrolment figure is a point-in-\ntime snapshot, and does not show the total number of graduate students who have been on \ncampus at various points during the year. December 1st headcounts are a snapshot of the Fall \nTerm registrations only.  \nVariation in graduate enrolment from one academic year to the next is due to three independent \nfactors. The number increases by the total number of new registrations, and it decreases by \nthe number of those leaving, through convocation or through attrition (see section 3). As an \naggregate measure, enrolment variations have to be understood with reference to the changes \nin these three factors. \nThis graph demonstrates the overall trends in graduate enrolment over the last decade. Course-\nbased Master’s programs show a consistent rise in enrolment levels, while we are beginning to \nsee a decrease in thesis-based programs.  \n0\n500\n1000\n1500\n2000\n2500\n3000\nH\ne\na\nd\nc\no\nu\nn\nt \nFall Term \nPhD\nThesis - based Master's\nCourse - based Master's\nOther\n6 \nSource: Strategic Analysis and Data Warehousing – accessed December 3, 2016  \nNotes: (1) Figures represent the Fall term enrolment headcount; (2) Students who have FGSR listed as their \ndepartment are included.  \nFaculty Fall 2012 Fall 2013 Fall 2014 Fall 2015 Fall 2016 \nALES 246 235 237 230 221 \nArts 472 478 452 413 412 \nBusiness 60 61 51 45 46 \nEducation 296 291 295 257 246 \nEngineering 717 702 711 678 679 \nExtension - - - - - \nFaculté Saint-Jean - - - - - \nFaculty of Native Studies - - - - - \nLaw 8 8 7 7 8 \nMedicine and Dentistry 319 316 340 342 329 \nNursing 71 65 68 64 68 \nPharmacy 34 33 32 32 28 \nPhysical Educ. & Recreation 60 65 55 56 49 \nPublic Health 41 42 45 50 47 \nRehabilitation Medicine 36 38 36 37 35 \nScience 709 686 646 566 564 \nTotal 3,069 3,020 2,975 2,777 2,732 \nSource: Strategic Analysis and Data Warehousing – accessed December 3, 2016  \n2574 2585 \n2794 \n2907 2952 \n3069 3020 2975 \n2777 2732 \n1986 \n2044 \n2128 2183 \n2200 \n2207 \n2217 2128 \n1966 \n2051 \n1728 \n1990 \n2124 2167 \n2242 \n2197 \n2272 2329 2325 2498 \n1500\n1700\n1900\n2100\n2300\n2500\n2700\n2900\n3100\n3300\nH\ne\na\nd\nc\no\nu\nn\nt \nFall Term \nPhD\nThesis - based Master's\nCourse - based Master's\n7 \nThis table shows a consistent growth in course-based Master’s programs, probably as a result \nof interest in professional Master’s degrees.  \nFall 2012 Fall 2013 Fall 2014 Fall 2015 Fall 2016 \nFaculty M-C M-T Total M-C M-T Total M-C M-T Total M-C M-T Total M-C M-T Total \nALES 13 249 262 26 258 284 21 261 282 22 244 266 35 255 290 \nArts 104 313 417 97 311 408 90 269 359 81 240 321 87 255 342 \nBusiness 448 - 448 499 - 499 543 1 544 558 - 558 556 - 556 \nEducation 497 97 594 496 85 581 546 80 626 567 70 637 576 70 646 \nEngineering 188 496 684 148 566 714 93 545 638 36 527 563 111 544 655 \nExtension 57 2 59 49 2 51 54 1 55 54 - 54 52 8 60 \nFaculté Saint-\nJean 30 20 50 24 16 40 16 13 29 20 8 28 13 5 18 \nFaculty of \nNative Studies - 7 7 - 10 10 - 7 7 - 12 12 - 20 20 \nLaw 1 8 9 2 6 8 - 4 4 - 5 5 1 5 6 \nMedicine and \nDentistry 2 277 279 2 265 267 - 281 281 2 260 262 4 277 281 \nNursing 32 43 75 43 33 76 47 29 76 45 20 65 36 18 54 \nPharmacy - 21 21 - 13 13 - 17 17 - 18 18 - 22 22 \nPhysical Educ. \n& Recreation 15 64 79 16 57 73 18 49 67 18 44 62 15 41 56 \nPublic Health 134 95 229 146 99 245 144 100 244 131 80 211 120 71 191 \nRehabilitation \nMedicine 589 37 626 633 41 674 667 39 706 680 48 728 779 49 828 \nScience 87 478 565 91 455 546 90 432 522 111 390 501 113 411 524 \nTotal 2197 2207 4404 2272 2217 4489 2329 2128 4457 2325 1966 4291 2498 2051 4549 \nM-T = Thesis-Based Master’s, M-C = Course-Based Master’s  \nSource: Strategic Analysis and Data Warehousing – accessed December 3, 2016  \nNotes: (1) Figures represent the Fall term enrolment headcount of Master`s students by Faculty; (2) Students who \nhave FGSR as their department are excluded. \n8 \nFaculty Fall 2012 Fall 2013 Fall 2014 Fall 2015 Fall 2016 \nALES 8 5 8 4 4 \nArts 13 14 23 17 16 \nBusiness 8 21 19 10 16 \nEducation 6 1 4 7 4 \nEngineering 7 12 9 9 9 \nExtension 3 1 - 1 - \nFaculté Saint-Jean 1 6 1 3 9 \nFaculty of Native Studies 1 - 1 - - \nLaw - - - - - \nMedicine and Dentistry 4 3 7 7 8 \nNursing 7 5 4 2 2 \nPharmacy - 2 - - 1 \nPhysical Educ. & Recreation - 1 3 3 1 \nPublic Health 2 4 4 1 3 \nRehabilitation Medicine 32 75 45 68 100 \nScience 10 5 12 4 4 \nTotal 102 155 140 136 177 \nSource: Strategic Analysis and Data Warehousing – accessed December 3, 2016  \nNotes: (1) Figures represent the Fall term enrolment headcount in other programs by Faculty; (2) Other programs \ninclude: post-Baccalaureate and post Master’s Certificates, postgraduate diplomas, qualifying, special, visiting and \nprobationary students (by Faculty).  \n9 \nThis table gives an overview of the ratio of graduate students to professors in each Faculty. The \ngoal is to express a supervisory ratio: thus all assistant, associate and full-time professors \n(those in academic category A.1.1) are included in the faculty number, and students include all \ntypes of programs (PhD, Master’s and Other).  \nWe have reported on every faculty in this dataset, although there are important nuances that \ncome to light in the following tables: Faculties with large course-based Master’s programs \n(Business’s MBA, most graduate programs in the Faculty of Rehabilitation Medicine, a \nsubstantial proportion of Engineering’s graduate offerings, e.g.) will appear to be carrying a \ndisproportionately heavy supervisory responsibility. The value of this table is principally in \ntracking whether student numbers and faculty complement are moving in tandem. Tables 1.3.2, \n1.3.3 and 1.3.4 offer breakdowns by degree. \nOn balance the graduate student to faculty ratio has stayed constant over the last five years, \nwith the exception of Fall 2014, when the professoriate shrunk (probably a function of budget \ncuts in previous years). \nFall 2012 Fall 2013 Fall 2014 Fall 2015 Fall 2016 \nFaculty Prof Grad Ratio Prof Grad Ratio Prof Grad Ratio Prof Grad Ratio Prof Grad Ratio \nALES 101 516 1:5.1 104 524 1:5.0 108 527 1:4.9 111 500 1:4.5 113 515 1:4.6 \nArts 353 902 1:2.6 347 900 1:2.6 319 834 1:2.6 322 751 1:2.3 323 770 1:2.4 \nBusiness 77 516 1:6.7 73 581 1:8.0 74 614 1:8.3 72 613 1:8.5 71 618 1:8.7 \nEducation 115 896 1:7.8 109 873 1:8.0 100 925 1:9.3 104 901 1:8.7 107 896 1:8.4 \nEngineering 184 1408 1:7.7 200 1428 1:7.1 194 1358 1:7.0 201 1250 1:6.2 204 1343 1:6.6 \nExtension 17 62 1:3.6 17 52 1:3.1 16 55 1:3.4 17 55 1:3.2 15 60 1:4.0 \nFaculté Saint-\nJean 33 51 1:1.5 30 46 1:1.5 25 30 1:1.2 29 31 1:1.1 30 27 1.1:1 \nFaculty of \nNative \nStudies 9 8 1.1:1 8 10 1:1.3 8 8 1:1.0 10 12 1:1.2 11 20 1:1.8 \nLaw 32 17 1.9:1 32 16 2:1.0 29 11 2.6:1 27 12 2.3:1 28 14 2:1.0 \nMedicine and \nDentistry 211 602 1:2.9 214 586 1:2.7 213 628 1:2.9 217 611 1:2.8 212 618 1:2.9 \nNursing 52 153 1:2.9 51 146 1:2.9 49 148 1:3.0 47 131 1:2.8 47 124 1:2.6 \nPharmacy 23 55 1:2.4 20 48 1:2.4 20 49 1:2.5 22 50 1:2.3 24 51 1:2.1 \nPhysical \nEduc. & \nRecreation 40 139 1:3.5 43 139 1:3.2 39 125 1:3.2 38 121 1:3.2 41 106 1:2.6 \nPublic Health 27 272 1:10.1 28 291 1:10.4 25 293 1:11.7 26 262 1:10.1 27 241 1:8.9 \nRehabilitation \nMedicine 42 694 1:16.5 48 787 1:16.4 42 787 1:18.7 44 833 1:18.9 44 963 1:21.9 \nScience 290 1284 1:4.4 300 1237 1:4.1 288 1180 1:4.1 286 1071 1:3.7 288 1092 1:3.8 \nTotal 1606 7575 1:4.7 1624 7664 1:4.7 1549 7572 1:4.9 1573 7204 1:4.6 1585 7458 1:4.7 \nSource: Strategic Analysis and Data Warehousing – accessed December 3, 2016. \nNotes: (1) Figures represent the professor headcount by faculty (Prof) compared with Fall term enrolment headcount \nof graduate students by faculty (Grad); (2) Contingent faculty, administrative faculty, and faculty on long-term \ndisability (LTD) are not captured; (3) Student numbers include all types of programs (PhD, Master’s and Other); (4) \nStudents who have FGSR as their department are excluded. \n10 \nThe ratio of doctoral students to faculty over this time period is relatively stable, indicating that \nthe decrease in the number of doctoral candidates has moved in parallel with the number of \nfaculty members.

Expanding the pool of \nqualified applicants is a component of active recruitment strategies. \nThe yield rate (the percentage of registrations resulting from offers of admission) has been \nextremely steady, at about two thirds. Increasing the yield rate is another component of active \nrecruitment strategies. \nIn the Applications and Admissions tables, the effect of not including non-Fall registrations can \nbe seen. Therefore we have provided a table stating the average Fall percentage of \napplications, admissions and registrations as compared to the year as a whole. \nThere is gender imbalance in the number of applications for different degrees, with doctoral \nprograms attracting almost twice as many male as female applicants, while the proportion is \nalmost reversed for course-based Master’s programs. Female applicants tend to have a higher \nyield rate than their male counterparts. \n24 \nThe following graph shows the total number2 of applications for admission to graduate \nprograms, the number of admissions offered and the number of subsequent registrations. This \napproach counts applications, not applicants: some applicants may have submitted multiple \napplications.  We continue to be competitive, admitting only about one third of the students who \napply to our graduate programs. The yield rate moves in tandem with the rate of admission, \nwhich gives stability and predictability – factors that are especially important for funding \nprojections. \nFall Proportion \nin total year \n2007-08 2008-09 2009-10 2010-11 2011-12 2012-13 2013-14 2014-15 2015-16 \nApplications 85% 85% 86% 85% 85% 82% 81% 81% 81% \nApplicants Admitted 80% 80% 81% 80% 78% 75% 77% 74% 73% \nApplicants Registered 79% 78% 80% 79% 76% 73% 75% 72% 74% \nSource: Strategic Analysis and Data Warehousing – accessed December 3, 2016. \nNotes: (1) *Academic year figures (Sept to Aug) for 2016-17 were extracted from December archive, which includes \nFall term numbers only.

While it is not entirely clear what is driving this increase, the dismal academic \njob market is likely to be part of the reason. This year we have indicated the average amount of \ntime spent on approved Leave of Absence (LOA). Such leaves currently include parental, \nmedical and a small number of compassionate leaves. As of January 2017, students may also \ntake professional leaves to pursue career-building internships and similar opportunities. We \nknow from other analyses that taking formal LOA increases the likelihood of completion, \nparticularly among doctoral students, even though it will obviously increase program length. \nCourse-based Master’s programs have become shorter, possibly because they have a higher \nproportion of international students, who consistently demonstrate shorter completion times (see \nTable 3.3). \nConvocation Year PhD M-T M-C Average LOA \n2007 6.09 3.43 3.03 0.70 \n2008 6.29 3.47 3.11 0.70 \n2009 6.25 3.49 2.98 0.79 \n2010 6.52 3.39 2.76 0.74 \n2011 6.28 3.33 2.63 0.71 \n2012 6.26 3.32 2.80 0.66 \n2013 6.22 3.30 2.87 0.79 \n2014 6.17 3.31 2.70 0.84 \n2015 6.33 3.34 2.72 0.74 \n2016 6.72 3.41 2.79 0.84 \nM-T = Thesis-Based Master’s, M-C = Course-Based Master’s (D=Domestic) (Int.=International), LOA = Leave of Absence \nSource: Strategic Analysis and Data Warehousing – accessed December 3, 2016.   \nNotes: (1) Convocation year = calendar year ( January 1 to December 31); (2) Figures show average completion time \nin years; (3) Completion time calculated as: first term of attendance to milestone completion date; (4) Any time spent \nin an official Leave of Absence (LOA) has not been deducted from the total completion time; (5) Excludes students in \nother program categories (qualifying, visiting and probationary students as well as people registered in post \nbaccalaureate certificates or postgraduate diplomas). \n31 \nIn every single year, in every type of degree, international graduate students complete their \ndegrees faster than domestic students do.

We have extended the length of \nour analysis back to 1999-2000 in order to highlight trends, which are the most reliable \nindicators given the complexity of calculating attrition rates. In general, Master’s attrition rates \nare falling. Doctoral attrition remains an area of concern. While we would never want the attrition \nrate to be 0% - because a PhD is not for everybody – it is particularly expensive to both \nstudents and the institution when doctoral students leave late in their programs. \nIn the chart below, each cohort of graduate students starting in a given academic year has been \ndivided into those who still had an active registration as of June 2015 and those who have \nobtained a degree. The remainder (“in attrition”) consists of those who have left the University \nwithout any credential. Students currently recorded as “still active” may either convocate or \nleave their program without a degree. Thus attrition rates become increasingly speculative as \nwe move toward the present. \nIn the aggregate table that follows, we decline to calculate attrition rates for cohorts that fall \nwithin the average time to completion of a PhD (~6 years, or 2011-12) – of course, this hides \nthe Master’s rates. The program-specific tables that follow break out this information more fully.  \nApplicants Registered Convocations Still Active In Attrition Attrition rate \n1999-00 1,284 1,035 0 249 19% \n2000-01 1,351 1,143 0 208 15% \n2001-02 1,441 1,209 1 231 16% \n2002-03 1,630 1,379 0 251 15% \n2003-04 1,739 1,481 0 258 15% \n2004-05 1,654 1,403 0 251 15% \n2005-06 1,601 1,361 4 236 15% \n2006-07 1,825 1,537 8 280 15% \n2007-08 2,026 1,716 19 291 14% \n2008-09 2,085 1799 32 254 ~12% \n2009-10 2,367 2004 95 268 ~11% \n2010-11 2221 1797 191 233 ~10% \n2011-12 2337 1763 340 234 ~10% \n2012-13 2274 1448 600 226 N/A \n2013-14 2331 1240 901 190 N/A \n2014-15 2171 571 1453 147 N/A \n2015-16 2201 53 2066 82 N/A \nFall 2016 1942 0 1941 1 N/A \nSource: Extracted from PeopleSoft; internal script \nNotes: (1) Figures are calculated taking into account the convocant's program at the time of admission; (2) Excludes \nstudents in other program categories (qualifying, visiting and probationary students as well as people registered in \npost baccalaureate certificates or postgraduate diplomas); (3) Academic year figures (Sept to Aug) for 2016-17 were \nextracted from December archive, which includes Fall term numbers only; (4) ~ = approximately. \n33 \nAttrition rates become increasingly speculative as we move to the present. Since the average \ntime to completion for PhD students at the University of Alberta is greater than six years, the \nattrition rates from 2011-12 onward should be disregarded, and those for the preceding two or \nthree years used only cautiously. Tracking the absolute number of convocating, still active and \nremaining students is useful to view over time, and that is why those figures have been reported \nhere. \nImportantly, these tables do not indicate when students leave the PhD program. Generally \nspeaking, the later, the more expensive – for both students and the university. The rule that \nstudents complete candidacy exams within the first 36 months of a PhD program is designed to \nprovide a solid checkpoint before students get too far along. \nApplicants registered Convocations Still active In attrition Attrition rate \n1999-00 327 231 0 96 29% \n2000-01 351 267 0 84 24% \n2001-02 386 300 0 86 22% \n2002-03 413 325 0 88 21% \n2003-04 440 354 0 86 20% \n2004-05 392 283 0 109 28% \n2005-06 376 280 2 94 25% \n2006-07 455 343 7 105 23% \n2007-08 450 347 15 88 20% \n2008-09 477 376 20 81 ~17% \n2009-10 547 395 73 79 ~14% \n2010-11 507 303 136 68 ~13% \n2011-12 502 204 225 73 N/A \n2012-13 532 74 379 79 N/A \n2013-14 469 29 389 51 N/A \n2014-15 458 6 401 51 N/A \n2015-16 452 0 420 32 N/A \nFall 2016 357 0 357 0 N/A \nSource: PeopleSoft; internal script \nNotes: (1) Figures are calculated taking into account the convocant's program at the time of admission.

The Canadian Association for Graduate Studies (CAGS) publishes annual \nStatistical Reports on enrolments by degree, by province, by field of study and by demographic \ncharacteristics. It correlates data from all graduate degree granting Canadian universities. \nThe second source of information comes from the U15 Group of Canadian Research \nUniversities Data Exchange. This data provides a better basis for comparison. However, it is not \npublic.  \nFor this year’s Graduate Enrolment report, we focused on recent U15 material that allows us to \ncompare the University of Alberta’s thesis-based degrees (both Master’s and PhD) with those of \nour peers in two areas: rate of completion, and time to completion. While we are not at liberty to \nreproduce raw data, we can describe the latest results of a recurrent analysis. \nIn June 2014, the U15 Group of Canadian Research Universities released a study of graduate \nstudents’ academic progression for the cohorts of doctoral students who began their programs \nin 2003 and 2007, and for the research master's cohort that began in 2007. A team at the \nUniversité de Montréal prepared the study, which is the twelfth set of published results on times \nto completion for graduate students in Canadian institutions. \nThe times to completion study follows students forward, defining a cohort at the beginning of \ntheir programs and tracking calendar time elapsed until the last term of study. For doctoral \nstudents, the measure of success is degree completion, whereas for Master’s students, success \nis measured in terms of completion or promotion to a doctoral program. The results include \nabsolute completion rates, length of study and cumulative completion rates over time. (The \nauthors note that the distribution of students across disciplinary divisions can significantly affect \nboth average completion rates and completion times.)4 \nOverall, student cohorts at the University of Alberta show high rates of program completion (or \npromotion): both the 2003 doctoral cohort and the 2007 master’s cohort are above the U15 \naverage for success in this category, with the doctoral cohort ranking 4th in the U15. The rate of \ncompletion for University of Alberta doctoral candidates has also steadily improved over time.  \nDegree completion after nine years by the 1999 doctoral cohort was below the U15 average, \nwhereas, five years later, the 2003 cohort had a nearly 10% higher completion rate, well above \nthe U15 average. \nIn contrast, times to completion for both doctoral and research Master’s students at the \nUniversity of Alberta are relatively high. Compared to the U15 average, students in the 2003 \ndoctoral cohort took, on average, 1 term longer to complete their programs, and those in the \n2007 research master’s cohort took an additional 1.6 terms to complete their degrees.  \n4 For example, in the 2003 doctoral cohort, the Sciences and Health Sciences students had the highest \ncompletion rates (U15 average above 77%), whereas the Engineering students had the fastest \ncompletion times (U15 average of 4.9 years). In an internal UofA multi-variate analysis conducted during \nthe last year, our data demonstrates that students in the Health Sciences are most likely to complete \n(though there is a range, from a low of 70% in Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences to a high of 89% \ncompletion in Medicine and Dentistry). Engineering doctoral students complete at the rate of 76%: the \nsame as ALES and Nursing. \n37 \nCombined completion and retention of the 2007 doctoral cohort after five years at the university, \nan early indicator of success, is just below the U15 average. However, given longer-than-\naverage completion times in the 2003 cohort and a high percentage of students still enrolled at \nthe time of the study, the overall success rate for the 2007 doctoral cohort may still be strong. \nAlthough we must close on a note of caution, since some of this data is soft and important \nvariation (by program, by field of study, by international vs domestic, etc.) can be obscured by \ngeneralization, the key takeaways here are that our thesis-based Master’s and PhD students \nhave strong rates of degree completion, and we have been improving our time-to-degree, \nrelative to our peer institutions. \nItem No. 7 \nGFC ACADEMIC PLANNING COMMITTEE \nFor the Meeting of January 18, 2016 \nOUTLINE OF ISSUE \nAction Item \nAgenda Title: Proposed new specialization in Human Resource Management to be added to existing \nTechniques d’administration des affaires diploma program at the Centre collegial de l’Alberta, \nCampus Saint-Jean \nMotion:  THAT the GFC Academic Planning Committee, under delegated authority from General Faculties \nCouncil, approve the proposed new specialization in Human Resource Management (Gestion des \nressources humaines) to be added to existing Techniques d’administration des affaires diploma program \noffered by the Centre collégial de l’Alberta as submitted by Faculté Saint-Jean and as set forth in Attachment \n1, to be effective upon approval.  \nItem   \nAction Requested Approval Recommendation   \nProposed by Pierre-Yves Mocquais, Dean, Centre collégial de l’Alberta (CCA) and \nFaculté Saint-Jean \nPresenter Pierre-Yves Mocquais, Dean, Centre collégial de l’Alberta (CCA) and \nFaculté Saint-Jean \nDolorèse Nolette,  Assistant Dean and Director, Centre Collégial de \nl’Alberta \nDetails \nResponsibility Provost and Vice-President (Academic) \nThe Purpose of the Proposal is \n(please be specific) \nTo add a new specialization in Human Resource Management (HRM) to \nthe existing Techniques d’administration des affaires(TAA) diploma \nprogram offered by the CCA. \nThe Impact of the Proposal is To provide CCA students with the opportunity to specialize in HRM by \ntaking HR courses in the Business Administration diploma program at \nNAIT in the second year of their UAlberta TAA diploma program. \nStudents already have the option of specializing in Marketing, Finance, \nAccounting and Management by taking second-year specialization \ncourses at the Northern Alberta Institute of Technology (NAIT). \nReplaces/Revises (eg, policies, \nresolutions) \nN/A \nTimeline/Implementation Date Effective upon approval \nEstimated Cost and funding \nsource \nThe courses required to specialize in HRM specialization will be offered \nin English at NAIT.

Attachment 1 (pages 1 - 8):  Centre collégial de l’Alberta’s proposed to add a New specialization in Human \nResource Management to the existing diploma program (Technique d’administration des affaires). \nPrepared by: Marie Simuong, Governance Coordinator, Faculté Saint-Jean \n1 \nProposal Template \nDiploma, Certificate and Non-credential Programs \nThe following template outlines the information required by Innovation and Advanced Education to \nsupport its comprehensive review of proposals for new certificate, diploma and non-credential \nprograms and new specializations in existing certificate, diploma and non-credential programs. \nThe guiding premise of the review is to ensure that the program adds value to Campus Alberta.  The \nreview will focus on the institution’s assessment of student and employer demand; the situation of the \nprogram in the context of Campus Alberta; the financial viability of the program, including \nimplications for students and taxpayers; and dimensions of program quality.   \nSECTION 1:  PROGRAM OVERVIEW \n1.1  Program Name \nTechniques d’administration des affaires (TAA), new specialization in Human Resource \nManagement(Gestion des ressources humaines) \n1.2  Institution(s) \nCentre collégial de l’Alberta(CCA), Campus Saint-Jean(CSJ), University of Alberta \n1.3  Contact Person \nName:  Dolorèse Nolette \nTelephone:  780-485-8648 \nEmail: dnolette@ualberta.ca  \n1.4  Type of Initiative \nThis proposal is to add a new specialization in Human Resource Management(HRM) (Gestion des \nressources humaines)   to the Techniques d’administration des affaires (TAA) diploma program. The \nTAA program is offered in collaboration with the Northern Alberta Insitute of Technology (NAIT). The \nUAlberta TAA curriculum is based on the NAIT’s Business Administration Diploma curriculum. First \nyear courses are offered in French at UAlberta through the CCA and second year courses are taken \nin English at NAIT in various specializations.   \nThis proposal is will ensure the UAlberta TAA program aligns with NAIT’s JR Shaw School of \nBusiness’s Business Administration Diploma program and the five specializations offered. In the \nprogram proposal approved by the Ministry of Advanced Education in 2011, the four specializations \noffered by NAIT were included: Marketing, Accounting, Finance and Management. Adding the HRM \nspecialization will ensure the programs will continue to align.   \nThe collaboration between NAIT and the University of Alberta is supported by an MOU signed in \n2011.  This MOU was signed by both parties in response to the Francophone community’s needs and \nin the interest of French language post-secondary education in Alberta.  \nAppendix 1 – Course descriptions \nNew Program Proposal – System Coordination and Quality Review 2 \nDiploma/Certificate Programs  \n1.5  Program Length \nDefine the length of the proposed program using measures appropriate to the schedule and delivery format.  \nThis will include total course credits and weeks, and, where relevant, hours and semesters of instruction. \nThis is a 2 year diploma program, four sixteen week terms with an optional 12 week practicum. The \nprogram may be taken in class or online in a synchronous delivery model. There are seven HRM \ncourses offered in the second year. \n1.6  Program Description \nProvide a brief (1-2 paragraphs) description of the program, summarizing its intended purpose, curriculum \ndesign, and methods of delivery and highlighting distinctive attributes.  Attach as an Appendix a complete list of \ncourses, including credit values, instructional hours and brief (calendar style) course descriptions.  For elective \noptions, specify course selection parameters. Identify new courses to be developed for this program.   \nThe two year Business Administration program, Human Resources Management(HRM) is offered by \nthe Centre collégial de l’Alberta in collaboration with NAIT.  The ten first-year common core courses of \nthe program as well as three second-year common core courses are offered in French at Centre \nCollégial de l’Alberta and the remaining seven second-year specialization courses are taken in \nEnglish at NAIT.  \nThis TAA diploma program with a specialization in HRM trains students for bilingual positions in \nmanaging human resources within organizations. Students develop an understanding of modern \nbusiness dynamics, and learn to work well within culturally diverse organizations.  All TAA students \nmust take a common first year that provides a grounding in basic business skills and an overview of \ncareer possibilities related to the program.  \nAPPENDIX 1 provides a complete list of the HRM courses offered in the specialization as well as the \npertinent course information.  Students will take the HRM courses in English at NAIT.  Having the \napproved specialization will allow UAlberta students to receive transfer credits and have the HRM \nspecialization recognized in a UA diploma.  \n1.7  Proposed Implementation Date \nThe HRM specialization is already offered by NAIT.  Students currently enrolled in their second year \nof the TAA program can take the HRM courses at NAIT.  There is no plan to offer the HRM \nspecialization in French at CCA at this time.   \n1.8  Enrolment Plan \n• See the attached program proposal from 2011 for Enrolment information. The addition of the \nHRM specialization will have no impact on enrolment. Note that all enrolment in the HR \nSpecialization in the second year will be recorded at NAIT. \nProposed Enrolment Year 1 Year 2 Year 3 Year 4 Year 5 Annual Ongoing \nTotal head count 0 0 0 0 0 0 \n• Full-Time Year 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 \n• Full-Time Year 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 \n• Full-Time Year 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 \n• Full-Time Year 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 \nAppendix 1 – Course descriptions \nNew Program Proposal – System Coordination and Quality Review 3 \nDiploma/Certificate Programs  \nTotal FLE 0 0 0 0 0 0 \n• FLE Year 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 \n• FLE Year 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 \n• FLE Year 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 \n• FLE Year 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 \nAnticipated No. of Graduates 0 0 0 0 0 0 \nSECTION 2:  DEMAND \n2.1  Student Demand Analysis \nAnalysis should be supported by relevant data for the region and for Campus Alberta, as might be derived from: \nsystematic questionnaire surveys of target audiences; application and enrolment summaries and trends for \nsimilar programs currently offered by other institutions; tabulations of unsolicited student inquiries and/or \nexpressions of interest obtained at student recruitment events; demographic projections for relevant sub-\npopulations.  \nThe decision to offer this specialization is to align with NAIT’s Business Administration Diploma \nprogram.
