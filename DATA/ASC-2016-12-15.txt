In addition to academic requirements \nfor admission, GFC authorizes each Faculty to establish such other \nreasonable criteria for admission of applicants as the Faculty may \nconsider appropriate to its programs of study, subject to the approval of \nGFC (e.g. interview, audition, portfolio, etc.) \nThe admission requirements for any Faculty will be those approved by \nGFC as set forth in the current edition of the University Calendar. In \naddition to the admission requirements, selection criteria for quota \nprograms, where they exist, will also be published in the current edition \nof the University Calendar. \nThe responsibility for admission decisions will be vested in the Faculty \nAdmission Committees or in the Deans of the respective Faculties, as \nASC Item 4- page 3\nItem No. 4A - D \nGFC ACADEMIC STANDARDS COMMITTEE \nFor the Meeting of December 15, 2016 \nthe councils of such Faculties will determine.” \n4.  UAPPOL Admissions Procedure: \n“PROCEDURE \n1. EFFECTIVE DATE OF CHANGES TO ADMISSION REGULATIONS \nFollowing approval by GFC: \na. Where changes to admission regulations may disadvantage students \nin the current admission cycle, normally implementation will be effective \nafter the change has been published in the University Calendar for one \nfull year (i.e., effective the second year that the information is published \nin the University Calendar). \nFor example, a change approved in May 2005 would be first published in \nthe 2006-2007 University Calendar in March 2006. Therefore the \nstatement cannot come into effect until September 2007 (affecting \napplicants who apply for the September 2007 term beginning July \n2006).” \nb. Where changes to admission regulations are deemed by the \napproving body to be ‘advantageous to students’, normally the date of \nimplementation will be effective immediately or at the next available \nintake for the admitting Faculty.” \n5.  PSLA: The PSLA gives Faculty Councils the authority to “determine \nthe conditions under which a student must withdraw from or may \ncontinue the student’s program of studies in a faculty” (Section 29(1)(d)). \n6. UAPPOL Academic Standing Policy:  “All current academic \nstanding regulations, including academic standing categories, University \ngraduating standards and requirements for all individual programs will be \nthose prescribed by Faculty Councils and GFC as set forth in the \nUniversity Calendar.” \n7. UAPPOL Academic Standing Regulations Procedures: “All \nproposed new academic standing regulations and changes to existing \nacademic standing regulations will be submitted by the Faculties or the \nAdministration to the Provost and Vice-President (Academic). Faculties \nwill also submit to the Provost and Vice-President (Academic) any \nproposed changes to the use and/or computation of averages relating to \nacademic standing, including promotion and graduation. \nIf the Provost and Vice-President (Academic) determines the proposal to \nbe in good order, the proposal will be introduced to the appropriate \nUniversity governance process(es). In considering these proposals, \ngovernance bodies will consult as necessary with the Faculties and with \nother individuals and offices. \nNormally, changes become effective once they are approved by GFC or \nits delegate and are published in the University Calendar.” \nAttachments  \nASC Item 4- page 4\nItem No. 4A - D \nGFC ACADEMIC STANDARDS COMMITTEE \nFor the Meeting of December 15, 2016 \n1.

All applicants must \nbe currently registered in the Faculty of Graduate Studies and Research \nin the Master Education program (MEd) of Faculté Saint-Jean. The four \ncourses (total *12) in the certificate will give students a deeper \nunderstanding of leadership in school administration. They are offered in \nFrench and will look specifically at Francophone and French Immersion \nEducation. \nThe Impact of the Proposal is We foresee a positive impact for the MEd program, on Faculté Saint-\nJean (FSJ) and on the University as a whole.  \n1.The Graduate Certificate in School Administration \nLeadership/Administration scolaire  will be a tool that will help us with \nretention in the MEd program. \n2. Although the Department of Educational Policy Studies offers \ngraduate programs in educational administration and leadership, this \ncertificate is very unique; no other program is offering an embedded \ncertificate on the topic in French that takes into consideration the realities \nand legal implications for both francophone and French immersion \ncontexts. The Faculty of Education does not offer such a certificate \neither.  \n3. We can attract more students in the field to the MEd program who will \nbe interested by the certificate.

Identify which \ninstitution(s) will award the \ncredential.  \nN/A  \nUnits of Course Weight *12 credits in total:  4 specified courses, each course weighs *3 credits \nThese 4 courses can be taken as a part of the graduate Master of Education (M Ed) \nprogram at Faculté Saint-Jean.  The M Ed thesis-based program requires a total of 7 \ncourses (*21) plus a thesis, and for the M Ed course-based program requires a total \nof 9 courses (*27) plus a capping exercise. Students in both the thesis-based and \ncourse-based MEd programs can take the 4 specified courses and qualify for the \nembedded certificate. \nThis is similar to the embedded graduate certificate in Mathematical and Statistical \nSciences, where the graduate certificate is 3 courses (*9) total from a specified list, \ntaken as part of an MSc thesis-based program that requires 6 courses (*18) and a \nthesis, or an MSc course-based program that requires 8 courses (*24) and a project. \nProgram Synopsis \nDescribe the program. Include \ncurriculum content, target student \ngroup, target employment, further \nThe Master of Education (MEd) programs, both course-based and thesis-based, at \nFSJ have been in place since 1994. On average 30 students are enrolled in the \nprogram.  The large majority of these students are taking it on a part-time basis \nbecause they are practitioners in the field: teachers, administrators at schools, \nmailto:selatia@ualberta.ca\n CFSJ 2016-10-28 Pt 07 \n2 \nOctober 22, 2010 \neducation options, etc.  schools boards, or with Alberta Education. For these students, the main objective \nfor continuing their education is to further their careers in their respective teaching \nenvironment either as vice-principals, principals, lead teachers, administrators in \nschools board, etc. \nLearning outcomes: the purpose of these four courses is to allow students a deeper \nunderstanding of leadership in school administration. They are offered in French \nand will look specifically at Francophone and French Immersion Education. They \nwill learn about the research and theoretical basis for school leadership. They will \nlearn about various angles and applications of leadership within school \nadministration. Lastly, within the last course, they will do field experience where \nthey will be placed within a school administrative context to learn more hands on \nabout leadership.  \nNumber of courses: four courses:  \nM EDU 540 : Dimensions politiques et administratives de l’éducation bilingue \nM EDU 560 : L’administration de l’éducation \nM EDU 561 : Formation des habiletés de supervision et de leadership  \nM EDU 562 : Stage pratique de direction \nDelivery format: The MEd program at FSJ is delivered in two ways: the first format \nallows students within the greater Edmonton as well as within the center of the \nprovince to attend classes face to face, Friday night and Saturday (9 hours) 4 times a \nsemester. In this live-delivery format, students can either be present or follow the \nclasses via a live web-delivery system (Acrobat Connect is currently used). The \nsecond format is a completely on-line format, where students follow the courses \nduring the semester, and submit their work on-line. The MEd courses that count for \nthis certificate will be offered in the same way.  \nSection B: Rationale, Implications and Impact  \nRationale for Introduction of \nCertificate \nOutline the rationale for the \nproposed embedded credit \ncertificate and provide supporting \ndata if applicable – eg. Results of \nstudent or economic demand \nanalyses; consultation with wider \ncommunity, etc.   \nAll the professional students taking the MEd at FSJ are interested in furthering their \ncareer in school administration. On average, 301 students are registered in the \nprogram at any given year; sometimes this number can go as high as 80 and can go \nas low as 20 active graduate students. The majority of our students choose to take \nthe courses on leadership and school administration. They have shown a keen \ninterest in furthering their education in this particular sub-field given their extrinsic \ninterest for their careers. By offering this certificate, we want to better prepare \ngraduates for such careers in school leadership and offer recognition of the \ncoursework through a certificate.  These educators who are working in the field \naspire to lead in their respective work environment, be it in the schools as lead \nteachers, as principals and vice-principals, within agencies that govern the teaching \nprofessions such Alberta Teachers’ Association (ATA), Alberta Education, School \nboards, etc.  \nWithin FSJ, we constantly receive requests for courses in academic administration \nand leadership.  This certificate arose as the highest priority from the needs analysis \nstudy with students in the program, consultations with the Francophone school \n1 This would be the average at the moment for the last 5 years. However, we have seen a drop in the numbers lately \nwith the budget cuts at school boards. By introducing the embedded certificates we hope to increase our numbers \n CFSJ 2016-10-28 Pt 07 \n3 \nOctober 22, 2010 \nboards and directors and superintendents. These consultations helped us decide that \nthis will be the first embedded certificate to be offered within FSJ Masters of \nEducation.  \nThe ATA and the four Francophone school boards, the professional bodies within \nthe province, will recognize this certificate and have already written and sent letter \nof support for it. \nThis embedded certificate is also supported by the Faculty of Education. In fact, \nfrom our meetings on this topic, we were able to identify other bilingual projects \nthat FSJ and the Faculty of Education can collaborate on with the creation of other \njoint initiatives for embedded certificates and graduate programs.   \nVision and Academic Plan \nHow does the proposed program \nconnect to the University’s vision \nHow does the program further the \nUniversity’s Academic Plan?  \nThe graduate program at Faculté Saint-Jean is uniquely situated to advance the \n“Comprehensive Institutional Plan “(2016) among educators in the second official \nlanguage of Canada. Educators in Western Canada (British Columbia, Alberta and \nSaskatchewan) look to the FSJ which for 5 decades now plays a pivotal role in the \nAlberta Teacher Education Program. Most of educators come to FSJ to further their \ngraduate studies. These are the leaders of education in the French Immersion \nprograms and Francophone school boards in the Francophone community and to \nsupport the national commitment to language diversity.  \nWe hope to also reach to Francophone Educational Programs outside of Canada \nwhose linguistic realities are almost identical to ours in Canada: dual languages.  \nWith this embedded certificate, we aim to build collaboration with Agence \nuniversitaire francophone and the Institut national de recherche scientifique, so that \nwe can:  \n1. have more international francophone educators enrolling in our programs \n2. further our understanding of bilingual education, \n3. build research partnership and graduate development programs, \n4. foster a north-south research and social relationship mostly with African \nfrancophone countries. \nAlignment with “For the Public Good” \n1) OBJECTIVE: Build a diverse, inclusive community of exceptional \nundergraduate and graduate students from Edmonton, Alberta, Canada, \nand the world.  \ni. Strategy: Develop and implement an undergraduate and graduate \nrecruitment strategy to attract top students from across the diverse \ncommunities in Alberta and Canada, leveraging our strengths as a \ncomprehensive research-intensive, multi-campus university with \noptions for francophone and rural liberal arts education. \n9) OBJECTIVE: Enhance, support, and mobilize the unique experiences \nand cultures of all University of Alberta campuses to the benefit of the \nuniversity as a whole. \nii. Strategy: Highlight and strengthen the role that Campus Saint-Jean \nplays in reflecting and reinforcing the linguistic duality of Canada \nas well as the worldwide multi-ethnic Francophonie, by positioning \nthe university locally, nationally, and internationally as a \ndestination of choice for francophone and bilingual students, and by \nprogressively improving Faculté Saint-Jean students’ and \napplicants’ access to French-language services. \nhttp://www.provost.ualberta.ca/en/%7E/media/provost/Documents/2016_UAlberta_CIP_FINAL.pdf\n CFSJ 2016-10-28 Pt 07 \n4 \nOctober 22, 2010 \nResource Implications \nIdentify the resource implications \nof the proposed embedded credit \ncertificate. Identify if resources are \nbeing re-allocated to or from other \nareas, and outline the implications \nof this re-allocation.   \nNo supplementary resources will be needed in order to implement this embedded \ncertificate.   \nFor students to receive this certificate, they would have to take 12 credits on the \nsubject (a sequence of four courses, three credits each). Each year, we offer two of \nthe four courses dealing with school administration (please see the list of the four \ncourses below). These courses are open to all students in the program; the four \ncourses will be on a two years rotation. We will not need extra faculty or extra \nresources to offer the certificate since the courses exist and are offered on a \nrotational basis each semester. In order to offer more advanced topics on the subject \nof school administration and leaderships, professors can develop new and advanced \ncourses under the open seminar course MEDU 586. \nEnrolment \nOutline the expected enrolment for \nthe embedded credit certificate and \nany potential impacts on course \nofferings. \nWe foresee a large number of students interested in this certificate based on the high \nenrolment in the courses in the current pool of students. In addition, many of them \nchoose to write their capping projects on topics related to school administration. We \nestimate that about 80% of the students in this program will be interested in \nfollowing this certificate.  \nImplications of Introduction of \nthe Credit Certificate \nIdentify the implications of the \nproposed embedded credit \ncertificate for the system. For \nexample, will it affect other \nprograms at the U of A, programs at \nother institutions, etc.?  \nWe foresee a positive impact for the MEd program, on FSJ and on the UA as whole.  \n1.The Graduate Certificate in School Administration Leadership/Administration \nscolaire  will be a tool that will help us with retention in the MEd program. \n2. Although the department of Educational Policy Studies offers graduate degree \nprograms in Educational Administration and Leadership, this certificate is very \nunique, no other program is offering an embedded certificate on the topic in French \nthat takes into consideration the realities and legal implications for both \nfrancophone and French immersion contexts. The Faculty of Education does not \noffer such a certificate either.  \n3. We can attract more students in the field to the MEd program who will be \ninterested by the certificate. Since our master’s program is on-line, we can have \nstudents from across Canada and maybe beyond, who would like to know more and \nget a certificate in school administration.  \n4. Students can complete the embedded certificate requirements while meeting the \nprogram requirements. No additional courses are necessary.  \nConsultation \nDescribe any consultation and/or \npotential impacts on service units of \nthe University, including the Office \nof the Registrar and Student \nAwards, Academic Information and \nCommunication Technologies \n(AICT), Library Administration, \nFacilities and Operations, Student \nServices, etc.  \nSince we already have the sequence of courses in the calendar, we do not foresee \nany impact or change to any other unit at the university.The student must complete \nthe degree program in order to receive the embedded graduate certificate. CSJ will \ncomplete 2 Reports of Completion forms, one for the degree and one for the \ncertificate and will submit both to FGSR who will confirm completion of the \nrequirements for both the degree and the certificate  and will update the student \nrecord for convocation. The student will receive (1) parchment for the M Ed degree \nand (1) certificate, in addition it will be displayed in the Conferred Degree section at \nthe top of the transcript. The official name of the certificate will be in French \n(similar to our degree programs). The template for the Graduate Certificate is \nalready in place with the Convocation Office. \n CFSJ 2016-10-28 Pt 07 \n5 \nOctober 22, 2010 \nAppendices \nAppendix A – curriculum and \nprogram structure \nList course names, numbers, and \ndescriptions.

Where changes to admission regulations may disadvantage students \nin the current admission cycle, normally implementation will be \neffective after the change has been published in the University \nCalendar for one full year (i.e., effective the second year that the \ninformation is published in the University Calendar). \nFor example, a change approved in May 2005 would be first published in \nthe 2006-2007 University Calendar in March 2006. Therefore the \nstatement cannot come into effect until September 2007 (affecting \napplicants who apply for the September 2007 term beginning July 2006). \nb. Where changes to admission regulations are deemed by the \napproving body to be ‘advantageous to students’, normally the date of \nimplementation will be effective immediately or at the next available \nintake for the admitting Faculty.” \n5. PSLA: The PSLA gives Faculty Councils the authority to “determine \nthe conditions under which a student must withdraw from or may \ncontinue the student’s program of studies in a faculty” (Section \n29(1)(d)). \n6.
