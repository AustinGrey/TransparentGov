It expresses the vision, \nvalues, history, and aspirations of our broad and diverse community.  \nThe success of our plan depends on all of us playing a role. As president, I have committed to \nleading initiatives where I can have the greatest impact – I ask you to do the same. I look \nforward to working with you to build, experience, excel, engage, and sustain for the public good.  \nImplementing “For the Public Good” \nFollowing the unanimous approval of “For the Public Good” by the Board of Governors on June \n17, Provost Dew and I identified three immediate tasks: first, to determine priorities for the short, \nmedium, and long-term; second, to develop an equitable, meaningful, and relevant set of \nqualitative and quantitative measures to monitor our progress and success on an annual basis \nover the coming years; and third, to create a transparent, effective, and sustainable annual \ninstitutional reporting and accountability process. \nOver the summer, a committee, consisting of staff and faculty from across campus, was struck \nto begin initial explorations around potential measures. At the end of August, we brought \ntogether the university’s leadership team for our annual Senior Administrators Retreat, where \nwe began the task of identifying short, medium, and long-term priorities and the best means to \nachieve them. It became clear throughout our discussions that delivering on our strategic goals \nwill require collaboration and integration of activities and efforts across the university. The senior \nleadership team left energized by the possibilities, which we will continue to move forward in the \ncoming weeks.  \nI invite all of you to join me at the State of the University Address on September 27 at noon in \nConvocation Hall, when I will formally launch “For the Public Good” and expand on immediate \nplanning. \nThe U15 and Universities Canada \nAs vice-chair of the U15 and a member of the Universities Canada Research Advisory \nCommittee, I am working with colleagues at other Canadian universities advising the federal \ngovernment  on the national research and innovation agenda. There are two relevant reviews \nunderway at the moment: a Basic Science review and an Innovation review. \nhttp://www.president.ualberta.ca/\n2 \nAt our recent U15 meeting, I had the opportunity to  provide input to the federal government’s \nInnovation Review panel.  Last week’s Research Advisory Comittee meeting was attended by \nDavid McFarlane, Policy Director to The Honourable Navdeep Singh Bains, Minister of \nInnovation, Science and Economic Development, and I provided advice on both current reviews.  \nMy roles with both the U15 and the Research Advisory Committee hels to align and situate the \nUniversity of Alberta within the national research agenda, and allow me to advance the U of A’s \nstrengths and interests at the national level. \nAdvancing Alberta \nPrior to the Senior Administrators Retreat, Debra Pozega Osburn and I traveled to Lethbridge \nand Medicine Hat on an Advancing Alberta Tour. We were welcomed by alumni, community \nmembers, and government officials in both cities. In Medicine Hat, we also were able to visit \ncolleagues at Medicine Hat College. A highlight of the trip was a tour of the Mattheis Research \nRanch, where we were able to see current ecological and rangeland management researchers. \nInternational Travel \nDuring my first year at the U of A, I focused on getting to know our internal community – on \nlistening, engaging, and understanding. I also worked to deepen our relationships with the city \nand province. Now, at the start of my second year, I need to turn my attention to our key \npartners and stakeholders abroad. This fall, I will be travelling to Hong Kong, China, and India to \nadvance the University of Alberta’s reputation, interests, and relationships in these regions. The \nU of A has 161 active agreements in China alone – I will be meeting with universities, ministries, \nand government officials to renew our agreements where appropriate, and to explore new \nopportunities for partnership and collaboration. We are a global institution with people and \nconnections across the world, and it’s important that I continue to cultivate our links to the \ninternational community.  \nRecent Initiatives \nOne of my goals over the next few months is to introduce “For the Public Good” to the wider \ncommunity and to share with them the vision and aspirations of the university for the next five \nyears. As part of that awareness building, I will also be highlighting some of the initiatives now \nunderway. The following  initiatives point to key areas of progress and development within “For \nthe Public Good.”  \nEnergy Research Leadership: \nOn September 6, the University of Alberta was awarded a $75 million Canada First Research \nExcellence Fund grant to establish the U of A’s Future Energy Systems Research Institute. A \nmajor collaborative, multi-disciplinary effort, the proposal builds from our strengths across the \nhttps://www.ualberta.ca/news-and-events/newsarticles/2016/september/ualberta-awarded-75m-for-energy-research\nhttps://www.ualberta.ca/news-and-events/newsarticles/2016/september/ualberta-awarded-75m-for-energy-research\n3 \nfull spectrum of energy and environment research. The institute will spearhead provincial, \nnational and international research partnerships and projects that envision and deliver solutions \nto global energy challenges—reducing the environmental footprint of today’s energy system, \nand making the transition to a cleaner, safer and more abundant low-carbon energy future. \nI’ve recently authored two opinion pieces on the U of A’s energy research leadership: the first \narticle, published in the Edmonton Journal and the Calgary Herald, was co-authored with \nElizabeth Cannon, President of the University of Calgary; the second article will be published by \nthe U15.  \nInfrastructure for Teaching, Learning, and Research:  \nOn September 8, the University of Alberta received $82.5 million in Strategic Investment \nFunding from the federal government. The funding supports capital projects and renewal that \nwill maintain and improve current campus infrastructure, help with the commercialization of \nspaces, and enhance environmental sustainability. Enhancements under the SIF program will \nbenefit students and ensure that the province plays a key role in diversifying Canada’s economy \nand creating a more sustainable future. Among the 10 projects are several enhancements that \nwill also serve to improve capacity for the Future Energy Systems Research Institute.  \nIndigenous Relations and Reconciliation: \nThe University of Alberta will continue to consult and collaborate, and work towards thoughtful, \nrespectful, and meaningful reconciliation with Indigenous peoples. A new sculpture called The \nSweetgrass Bear, by Stewart Steinhauer, is part of the university’s reconciliation efforts. The \nSweetgrass Bear is the first installment in a Provost’s Office initiative to acquire Indigenous art, \nwhich seeks to diversify cultural representation on campus. I encourage you to find a few \nminutes to visit the Sweetgrass Bear in Quad, and to read Stewart Steinhauer’s blog post about \nthe meaning and significance of the sculpture. \nAt the end of this month, we will be hosting the 2nd annual Building Reconciliation Forum. \n“Building Reconciliation” will bring together Canadian university presidents and their leadership \nteams, First Nations, Métis and Inuit leaders, student leaders, Indigenous scholars, and \nscholars dedicated to research that conducted in partnership with and is meaningful to \nIndigenous peoples. The forum will examine how universities are responding to the Truth and \nReconciliation Commission's Calls to Action. \nAcademic Excellence \nEvery day our faculty, staff and students have news-worthy accomplishments, each with a \nhistory, a future, and a team of individuals that helped make it happen: \nVice-President (Research) Lorne Babiuk is the 2016 World Agriculture Prize Laureate, an award \nbestowed by the Global Confederation of Higher Education Associations for Agriculture and Life \nhttp://edmontonjournal.com/opinion/columnists/opinion-alberta-universities-answering-global-call-to-action-on-energy-research\nhttp://edmontonjournal.com/opinion/columnists/opinion-alberta-universities-answering-global-call-to-action-on-energy-research\nhttps://www.ualberta.ca/news-and-events/newsarticles/2016/september/ualberta-receives-82-million-infrastructure-boost\nhttps://www.ualberta.ca/news-and-events/newsarticles/2016/september/ualberta-receives-82-million-infrastructure-boost\nhttp://blog.ualberta.ca/2016/08/the-sweetgrass-bear.html\nhttp://blog.ualberta.ca/2016/08/the-sweetgrass-bear.html\nhttp://blog.ualberta.ca/2016/09/consider-this-stewart-steinhauer-on.html\nhttps://sites.google.com/a/ualberta.ca/brforum/\nhttps://www.ualberta.ca/news-and-events/newsarticles/2016/september/babiuk-wins-2016-world-agriculture-prize\n4 \nSciences. The prize recognizes Babiuk’s exceptional lifetime achievements, which include \ndeveloping six vaccines.  \nI’m also proud to report that three University of Alberta researchers—Graham Pearson, Richard \nSutton, and Bruce Dancik—have been named fellows of the Royal Society of Canada (RSC). In \naddition, Duane Froese, Lynne-Marie Postovit, Candace Nykiforuk, Zamaneh Kassiri, and \nIsabelle Le Breton-Miller were named members of the RSC’s College of New Scholars, Artists \nand Scientists. \nSenior Leadership Transitions \nLastly, we’ve had several recent transitions in senior leadership at the U of A.

The \nexecutive for 2016 - 17 has taken May to coalesce our ambitions and aspirations for the Students’ \nUnion. They center around three pillars of the student experience: respecting student agency and \nautonomy, building foundations for success, and aligning with student needs. Here is a brief \nsnapshot of our focuses for the year, as they relate to these three core pillars. \nRespecting Student Agency and Autonomy \nStudent Groups \n• Ensuring that student groups are able to create traditions on campus to build a sense of \ncommunity and help make our large campus seem more like home during our studies. \nResidences \n• Ensuring that the Task Force results in actionable changes that will serve current students in \nresidence, and also increase residences’ value for prospective students. \n• Increasing meal plan acceptance across campus vendors. \nBuilding Foundations for Success \nMental Health \n• Centralizing resources for easier access to mental health resources by creating a website \nthat will also act as a triage tool with self-evaluation to direct them to appropriate services. \nResponding to the Adult Learning Review \n• Advocating to reduce barriers to access for post-secondary by increasing our non-repayable \ngrants, and regulating the international differential fee.  \n• Pushing to acquire a stable and predictable funding for all post-secondary institutions. \nFlexible Course Loads \n• Determining if the accelerated and extended degree options available align with student \nneeds by examining program completion rates. \n• Working with Student Accessibility services to ensure students who need academic workload \naccommodation are still eligible for academic scholarships and financial aid. \nInterdisciplinary Learning \n• Ensuring students leave their program with dynamic skills through interdisciplinary minors, \nand expanding interdisciplinary learning opportunities available in existing programs. \nAligning with Student Needs \nStudent Safety \n• Working with a refocused operational UAPS Board to give increased feedback on service \nand deliver more AEDs, with increased patrols at Campus Saint Jean. \n• Running an ETS-styled anti-sexual harassment campaign in the Fitness & Lifestyle Centre \nwith messaging such as “Leering is not OK”. \nItem No. 6B \nGENERAL FACULTIES COUNCIL \nFor the Meeting of September 26, 2016 \n OUTLINE OF ISSUE \nAdvice, Discussion, Information Item  \nAgenda Title: Graduate Students' Association (GSA) Board Strategic Work Plan 2016-2017 \nItem   \nProposed by Sarah Ficko, President, Graduate Students’ Association (GSA) \nPresenter Sarah Ficko, President, Graduate Students’ Association (GSA) \nDetails \nResponsibility Graduate Students’ Association (GSA) \nThe Purpose of the item is \n(please be specific) \nTo brief the Board Learning and Discovery Committee, the GFC \nExecutive Committee, and General Faculties Council (GFC) on the key \npriorities for 2016-2017 identified by the GSA in  its  Board  Strategic \nWork Plan (SWP). \nThis item provides the opportunity for communication and discussion \nbetween the GSA and, respectively, the Board of Governors and GFC \nregarding the GSA’s strategic planning process and goals for 2016-2017. \nTimeline/Implementation Date Ongoing \nSupplementary Notes and \ncontext \nEngagement and Routing (Include meeting dates) \nParticipation: \n(parties who have seen the \nproposal and in what capacity) \n<For further information see \nthe link posted on \nthe Governance Toolkit section \nStudent Participation Protocol> \nThose who have been informed: \n• GFC Executive Committee – September 12, 2016 \n• General Faculties Council – September 26, 2016 \n• Board Learning and Discovery Committee - September 29, 2016 \nAlignment/Compliance \nAlignment with Guiding \nDocuments \nFor the Public Good \nGOAL: EXPERIENCE diverse and rewarding learning opportunities that \ninspire us, nurture our talents, expand our knowledge and skills, and \nenable our success. \nObjective 8: Create and facilitate co-curricular and extracurricular \nlearning experiences for undergraduate and graduate students that \nenable their self-discovery and give them the skills to use their talents, \ncreativity, and curiosity to contribute as future citizens and leaders.  \nStrategy iii: Support the roles of the Graduate Students’ Association and \nStudents’ Union, along with other student groups, in the promotion of \nextracurricular programs that create a sense of community and support \nthe learning environment. \nhttp://www.governance.ualberta.ca/GovernanceToolkit/Toolkit.aspx\nhttp://www.governance.ualberta.ca/GovernanceToolkit/Toolkit.aspx\nItem No. 6B \nGENERAL FACULTIES COUNCIL \nFor the Meeting of September 26, 2016 \n Compliance with Legislation, \nPolicy and/or Procedure \nRelevant to the Proposal \n(please quote legislation and \ninclude identifying section \nnumbers) \n1.

General Faculties Council (GFC) is routinely called upon to arrange for the election of \nrepresentative(s) to populate approved search/review committee compositions in accordance to the policies \nand procedure within the Recruitment Policy (in UAPPOL). \nCampus interest and response to a nomination call may generate a pool of multiple nominees, thus requiring \nan election (held by GFC) to declare the successful candidate(s) to a membership role on the selection/review \ncommittee. It's regular practice by the GFC Nominating Committee, through the delegation of authority given \nby GFC, to electronically distribute nomination calls to the relevant constituencies (academic staff, non-\nacademic staff, public members) in order to raise awareness and encourage nominations and/or expressions \nof interest from eligible nominees, as stipulated within the established committee membership composition. \nELECTIONS HELD BY GFC - ACADEMIC STAFF TO SELECTION COMMITTEES \n2016-2017 Dean Selection Committee - Dean, Faculty of Nursing \nAugust 22, 2016 - the following individual has been declared elected by acclamation to serve as the \nacademic staff representative from (Staff Category A1.0) from outside the Faculty concerned, as indicated \nwithin Section 13 (h.) of the \"Faculty Deans Selection Procedure\" (Appendix A: Dean Selection Committee for \nIndividual Faculties). \n• Shairaz Baksh (Faculty of Medicine and Dentistry) \n2016-2017 Dean Selection Committee - Dean, Faculty of Education \nAugust 22, 2016 - the following individual has been declared as elected to serve as the academic staff \nrepresentative from (Staff Category A1.0) from outside the Faculty concerned, as indicated within Section 5 \n(j.) of the \"Faculty Deans Selection Procedure\" (Appendix A: Dean Selection Committee for Individual \nFaculties). \n• Pirkko Markula-Denison (Faculty of Physical Education and Recreation) \n2016-2017 Dean Selection Committee - Dean, Faculty of Medicine and Dentistry \nAugust 11, 2016 - a campus-wide call for academic staff nominations did not result in any nominees coming \nforward.
