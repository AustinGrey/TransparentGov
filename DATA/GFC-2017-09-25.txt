            "Description": "Purpose of the Proposal: The GFC Committee on the Learning Environment (CLE) was requested by GFC to report on research into the use of student rating mechanisms of instruction in university courses. This report fulfills this request. Discussion: Prior to the presentation on the Report, GFC Secretary and Manager of GFC Services Meg Brolley provided an update to members on the amended wording of the original motion to include the term “non-discriminatory”, and that although the meeting material did not include the term, the Report did address it. Chair of the GFC Committee on the Learning Environment (CLE) Sarah Forgie provided members with a summary of the Report including details about the scholarly methodology of researching and compiling the data presented. She noted that this project also obtained ethics approval and included consultation with Department Chairs at the university. Dr Forgie indicated that the CLE recommendations provided with the report were crafted to lay out the next steps for further action. A member expressed concern with the omission of “non-discriminatory” from the wording of the motion and indicated that it had impacted the findings within the report, in that it does not adequately address gender bias, and bias against visible minorities. The member further noted that, because of these biases, student ratings of instruction should not be used in promotion and tenure decisions at the institution. Dr Nocente reported that the literature clearly reflects the value of student ratings of instruction and that student feedback at the post-secondary level is important. She noted that the USRI tool is not designed to be used as the only measure, but that Department Chairs may not have the resources to consider multifaceted evaluations. Following a motion to extend the meeting, the President vacated the Chair due to another commitment and the Provost assumed the role of Acting Chair. Following this, members continued to debate the relevance and prevalence of biases within the literature. Citing time constraints and with consensus from members that additional discussion was required, the Acting Chair suggested a motion to table this item to the next meeting of GFC.",

Following wide consultation with faculty members, staff, students and alumni, the proposed name was approved by Faculty Council earlier this year. He noted that the addition of the word ‘sport’ to the title originated from inside the academy to reflect the Faculty’s expertise in sports-related subjects.

I encourage you to explore the \nnew priorities, and to check back regularly for updates on our progress.  \nI have also highlighted several recent developments in the following pages. Of particular note: \n• The National Recruitment Strategy  sparked a 26% increase in out-of-province high-school \napplicants by the end of its first phase, and moves into its next phase bolstered by a redesigned \nadmissions website \n• The U of A is joining Universities Canada and the U15 to advocate for the recommendations of the \nNaylor Report and influence the strategic direction of federal investment in basic research \n• We have turned our collective attention to Objective 22: we are tackling key financial issues by \ndeveloping better financial planning tools and processes that will allow us to use resources to \nmaximum effect and take advantage of opportunities in the future \nFinally, I invite each of you to join me for the 2017 State of the University Address:  \nSeptember 26, 2017  \n12 p.m. – 1 p.m.  \nConvocation Hall  \nhttps://www.ualberta.ca/strategic-plan/institutional-priorities\nhttps://www.ualberta.ca/strategic-plan/reporting\n2 \nOFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT  \n2-24 South Academic Building (SAB)  |  Edmonton, Alberta, Canada T6G 2G7  |  president.ualberta.ca \nAdmissions and National Recruitment  \nThe Registrar’s Office, University of Alberta International, and University Digital Strategy have been \nworking together to improve the prospective student web experience. On August 30, they launched \na new admissions website.  \nA few highlights of the new site: \n• Mobile friendly \n• Improved integration with ualberta.ca \n• Combines the domestic and international prospective-student websites \nThe new site underpins our National Recruitment Strategy as we move into the second phase of the \ntwo-year plan. At end of the strategy's first phase, we saw a 26% increase in out-of-province high-\nschool applications—and 27% and 31% increases in admissions and registrations, respectively.  \nKEY TALKING POINT:  \nAs one of Canada’s top universities, we strive to attract exceptional \nstudents from across the country. These students bring a diversity of \nideas and perspectives that strengthen our whole community.  \nCanada 150 Research Chairs \nThe Canada 150 Research Chairs are a federal investment of $117.6 million in research funding. \nThe U of A has been allocated up to $5 million, and we are using this opportunity to work towards \nObjective 2 (faculty renewal) of For the Public Good. Our internal adjudication committee focused \non supporting early and mid-career researchers to bolster and sustain a talented academy, and \nmore than 60% of our submissions were female. The chairs will be announced by the end of 2017.  \nLaunch of folio.ca; Revamp of The Quad \nOn September 5, the U of A launched its new brand journalism site: folio.ca. The site combines a \njournalistic writing style with the experiences of our U of A experts. This new tool strengthens our \nability to share the U of A story with a global audience that is increasingly accustomed to seeking \nnews channels on their own, and increasingly savvy about fake news and alternative facts.  \nWe also re-designed and re-launched The Quad. The new version is cleaner and more accessible, \nand will help us continue to strengthen our sense of community within the U of A.  \nhttps://www.ualberta.ca/admissions/undergraduate\nhttps://www.rso.ualberta.ca/Applying/SponsorsPrograms/Canada%20150%20Research%20Chairs.aspx\nhttp://www.folio.ca/\nhttps://blog.ualberta.ca/\n3 \nOFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT  \n2-24 South Academic Building (SAB)  |  Edmonton, Alberta, Canada T6G 2G7  |  president.ualberta.ca \nAugustana: New Academic Calendar and 1st Year Seminar \nThis semester, Augustana introduced a new academic calendar and first year seminar in which \nstudents take a three-week block course followed by a more traditional eleven-week session. \nIn For the Public Good, we envisioned Augustana Campus as a living laboratory for teaching and \nlearning innovation. The new academic calendar is a based on research completed at Augustana; it \nis designed to create more time for out-of-classroom learning experiences. Together with the \nseminar, it will help connect students to community and experiential learning opportunities, and \ncreate personally fulfilled learners who are ready to pursue careers upon graduation. \nYou can learn more about the new calendar and seminar here.  \nFrench Applications \nStudents can now apply online for any undergraduate program in French.  \nThis online application was developed collaboratively by the Office of the Registrar and Campus \nSaint-Jean. It replaces an outdated paper application process for French students.   \nThe change not only better reflects Canada's linguistic duality, but positions the U of A as an \ninstitution of choice for francophone and bilingual students, helping us to build a diverse and \ninclusive community of exceptional students. \nKEY TALKING POINT:  \nOur multi-campus environment is one of our great strengths. We \ncontinue to draw on the unique experiences of our different campuses, \nand deepen connections and collaborations to the benefit of the whole \nuniversity.   \nResidence Experience at the U of A \nWe know that living on campus forms an important part of the university experience, especially for \nfirst-year students. This year, a Residence Oversight Committee is being struck to begin \nimplementing the Residence Life Task Force’s nine recommendations for improving residential \nexperiences across our campuses. \nAt the start of the fall semester, more than 90% of our 4,500 residence spaces are occupied. We \nrecently began construction on 800 new residence spaces to ensure that future students also have \nthe opportunity to live on campus. \nhttps://www.ualberta.ca/augustana/about-us/advantage/calendar\nhttps://blog.ualberta.ca/parlez-vous-fran%C3%A7ais-introducing-the-u-of-as-online-french-application-for-admission-a170620aedfa\n4 \nOFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT  \n2-24 South Academic Building (SAB)  |  Edmonton, Alberta, Canada T6G 2G7  |  president.ualberta.ca \nAcademic Excellence \nThe U of A community has a reputation for excellence in teaching, learning, and research that \nstretches across all disciplines. Here are just a few recent examples:  \n• U of A expertise in AI and machine learning attracted DeepMind—one of the world’s leading AI \nresearch companies—to open its first international research base in Edmonton. DeepMind Alberta \nwill be led by professors Richard Sutton, Michael Bowling, and Patrick Pilarski. \n• This September, six U of A researchers were elected to the Royal Society of Canada, our country’s \noldest and most prestigious scholarly institute. \n• U of A ranked first in Canada and 52nd in the world in the recent 2018 QS Graduate Employability \nRanking.  \nTEC Edmonton/Merck Accelerator \nEarlier this month, I participated in the announcement of the new TEC Edmonton/Merck \nAccelerator, a business incubator for health technology companies. The accelerator will give \nuniversity researchers, and other Alberta-based health startups, the resources and mentorship \nthey need to move their health discoveries to market more quickly. \nKEY TALKING POINT:  \nTo serve the public good, we need to translate knowledge. Our health \nresearchers, for example, need to be able to convert their results into \npractical applications that protect, preserve, and improve human life.   \nNSERC Discovery Grant Funding \nOn September 8, the federal government announced $26.1 million in fundamental research funding \nfor more than 160 U of A research projects through the NSERC Discovery Grants program. The \nfunding spans many natural sciences and engineering fields, and includes researcher, post-\ngraduate student, postdoctoral fellow projects.  \nFundamental research funding remains critical to the University of Alberta as a broad-based, \nresearch-intensive university—it enables our researchers to succeed and excel. We will continue to \nadvocate for basic research funding moving forward (see: “Naylor Report Advocacy” below). \nhttp://www.folio.ca/ualberta-expertise-brings-deepmind-lab-to-edmonton/\nhttp://www.folio.ca/six-ualberta-researchers-elected-to-the-royal-society-of-canada/\nhttp://www.folio.ca/ualberta-grads-have-highest-employment-rate-in-canada/\nhttp://www.folio.ca/ualberta-grads-have-highest-employment-rate-in-canada/\nhttp://www.folio.ca/albertas-life-sciences-innovators-to-get-boost-from-new-health-tech-business-incubator/\nhttp://www.folio.ca/albertas-life-sciences-innovators-to-get-boost-from-new-health-tech-business-incubator/\nhttp://www.folio.ca/figuring-out-how-climate-change-affects-the-fungi-that-feeds-trees-and-absorbs-carbon/\n5 \nOFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT  \n2-24 South Academic Building (SAB)  |  Edmonton, Alberta, Canada T6G 2G7  |  president.ualberta.ca \nNaylor Report Advocacy \nThe final report of Canada’s Fundamental Science Review—known as the Naylor Report—was \nreleased in April of 2017. The report holds several recommendations to strengthen the federal \nresearch ecosystem, including significant reinvestment. \nBoth Universities Canada and the U15 have begun an advocacy campaign to influence the strategic \ndirection of federal investment in fundamental science, and the U of A is supporting this effort. We \nhave two primary goals:  \n1. Raise awareness of the importance of basic research, and provide examples of \ninnovation sparked by basic research \n2. Create a sense of urgency to act on the recommendations outlined in the Naylor Report \nTo this end, I am personally engaging in several communications and advocacy initiatives. I invite \nyou to do the same, where appropriate.  \nKEY TALKING POINT:  \nFunding for basic research is essential to driving economic growth, \nsupporting innovation, and creating jobs—university research improves \nthe lives of Albertans, Canadians, and people around the world.  \nU of A’s United Way Campaign \nOn October 11, the U of A will kick off a revitalized United Way campaign. Running through October \n23, the 2017 campaign features a matching program for new monthly donors with two major goals: \n1. $750,000 total funds raised (up from $500,000)  \n2. 12% participation rate (up from 6%) \nThe United Way campaign demonstrates our commitment to the promise of uplifting the whole \npeople, and to our vision and mission of serving the public good.  \nCanada 150 Community Celebration \nI invite you to join me at South Campus on September 24 for the U of A’s Canada 150 Community \nCelebration. This year, we have been recognizing the U of A people, achievements and ideas that \nhelped to build our nation. The Community Celebration is the U of A’s signature Canada 150 event, \nand will feature the grand opening of a new commemorative park: the Evergreen Pond. \nhttp://www.sciencereview.ca/eic/site/059.nsf/eng/home\nhttps://blog.ualberta.ca/save-the-date-for-the-u-of-as-canada-150-community-celebration-ecd923d2c41f\nhttps://blog.ualberta.ca/save-the-date-for-the-u-of-as-canada-150-community-celebration-ecd923d2c41f\n6 \nOFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT  \n2-24 South Academic Building (SAB)  |  Edmonton, Alberta, Canada T6G 2G7  |  president.ualberta.ca \n2016-2017 Progress Overview \nThe For the Public Good website remains our primary tool for reporting on progress towards our \nstrategic goals. We recently published a 2016-17 Progress Overview to recap the developments of \nthe past year.  \nArranged by the plan’s key verbs, the overview identifies the objectives and strategies that we have \neither achieved or set in motion thus far. Moving forward, we are planning updates three times per \nyear: in September, January, and June.  \nFinancial Sustainability \nSeveral strategic issues and initiatives are now underway that relate to Objective 22. All focus on \nthe financial health of our institution, and on building the capacity to invest in our priorities. \nOver the coming months, we will be:  \n• Addressing a long-standing financial challenge: the operating budget structural deficit \n• Responding to the results of two key government reviews on tuition and funding \n• Preparing new agreements within a new Labour Relations environment \n• Creating a UAlberta Budget Model \n• Implementing a new multi-year budget planning and accountability process \n• Using new budget software (uPlan) for the first complete budgeting cycle \nStudent Mental Health Funding \nOn September 11, the Government of Alberta announced $2.6 million in mental health funding for \npost-secondary institutions in Edmonton, with $1 million allotted to the U of A. The funding will \nhelp to bolster mental health programs that provide support to our students, faculty and staff.   \nThank you for your continued dedication to the University of Alberta. \nYours sincerely, \nDavid H.

Letter from Graduate Students’ Association President Babak Soltannia providing highlights of the 2017-2018 \nGSA Board Strategic Work Plan (2 pages)  \nPrepared by: Babak Soltannia, President, Graduate Students’ Association, gsa.president@ualberta.ca, (780) \n492-2175 \nmailto:gsa.president@ualberta.ca\nAugust 28, 2017 \nDear Members of the GFC EXEC, GFC, and BLDC, \nEach spring and summer the Graduate Students’ Association (GSA) executive team produces a rolling Board Strategic \nWork Plan (SWP). The GSA Board’s SWP serves to identify key priorities and initiatives, direct the GSA’s efforts for the \ncoming year, and identify areas where we can work with others in the University community.  \nThe GSA Directly-Elected officers participated in a workshop on May 18 to develop the 2017-2018 SWP, using the \n2016-2017 GSA Board SWP as a starting point. The draft 2017-2018 SWP was reviewed and discussed by the GSA \nBoard on May 24 and May 31. During these conversations, the elected team identified several key team goals, as well \nas other pivotal initiatives associated with their individual portfolios. These goals were shared with GSA Council on \nJune 19, 2017, and following the GSA Councillor group discussions, the GSA Board reviewed and incorporated the \nfeedback and ideas received into the SWP. Finally, the GSA Board presented the final SWP to GSA Council on July 17, \n2017. The elected team is committed to working on all the initiatives outlined in our SWP, but will use the team and \nindividual portfolio goals, as listed below, to guide our conversations and work with key stakeholders in the University \ncommunity.  \nTeam Goals: \n• The GSA will advocate for the University to launch a review of the current state of graduate student funding \non campus and to consider the creation of transparent and sustainable funding packages for all thesis-based \ngraduate students that support a reasonable standard of living and which take into consideration ‘time to \ncompletion’ requirements, the cost of living in Edmonton, and current tuition costs.  \n• Promote the need for clear and concise contract terms in offer letters issued by the University, and urge that \nthese letters be made available to graduate students well in advance of deadlines for offers of admission. \n• Advocate for the continuation of a tuition model that ties graduate student tuition increases to the Alberta \nConsumer Price Index (CPI), oppose across-the-board increases, and advocate that provincial regulations \nconcerning tuition increases be applied to international graduate students. Should some formulary aside \nfrom tethering increases to Alberta CPI be considered (such as the Academic Price Index), ensure that proper \nconsultation is undertaken and that any such proposals will benefit graduate students. \n• Support the need for sustainable, affordable, and well-maintained graduate student housing on campus and \nother options, to both prevent homelessness and enhance the graduate student experience. \n• Advocate for appropriate training and accountability measures that retain a focus on addressing power \nimbalances in supervisory relationships and cultivate a culture in which graduate students are acknowledged \nas junior colleagues.  \nIndividual Portfolio Goals: \n• Ensure active participation in the Mandatory Non-Instructional Fees (MNIFs) Oversight Committee. \n(President) \n• Maintain engagement with the Alberta Graduate Provincial Advocacy Council (ab-GPAC) to ensure the \npriorities of U of A graduate students are heard by both ab-GPAC and the provincial government. (President \nand Vice-President External) \n• Support professional development and internship opportunities for graduate students. (Vice-President \nAcademic) \n• Engage with Residence Associations and other stakeholders concerning the collection of Residence \nAssociation fees. (Vice-President External) \n• Assist graduate students living in residences to ensure safe conditions and the provision of excellent services, \nwhich will include securing GSA representation on the newly formed Residence Oversight Committee. (Vice-\nPresident Student Services and Vice-President External) \n• Negotiate for increased compensation for graduate assistantships in the Collective Agreement and educate \nthe campus community on the provisions of the Collective Agreement. (Vice-President Labour)  \n• Ensure the GSA’s compliance with Bill 7 and consult with/educate graduate students on the implications of \nthis legislation. (Vice-President Labour) \n• Support the Campus Food Bank in its mission to ensure the delivery of adequate food for students and their \nfamilies. (Vice-President Student Services) \nAlong with the GSA Vice-Presidents, I am looking forward to a productive and engaging year working closely with the \nUniversity’s administration team, and other stakeholders, as we pursue these goals on behalf of our graduate student \nconstituents.

Post-Secondary Learning Act (PSLA): The PSLA gives GFC \nresponsibility, subject to the authority of the Board of Governors, over \nacademic affairs (Section 26(1)). Further, the PSLA gives the Board of \nGovernors authority over certain admission requirements and rules \nrespecting enrolment (Sections 60(1)(c) and (d)). The Board has \ndelegated its authority over admissions requirements and rules \nrespecting enrolment to GFC. GFC has thus established an Academic \nStandards Committee (GFC ASC).  \n2.

UAPPOL Admissions Policy: “Admission to the University of Alberta \nis based on documented academic criteria established by individual \nFaculties and approved by GFC. These criteria may be defined in areas \nsuch as subject requirements, minimum entrance averages, and \nlanguage proficiency requirements. In addition to academic requirements \nfor admission, GFC authorizes each Faculty to establish such other \nreasonable criteria for admission of applicants as the Faculty may \nconsider appropriate to its programs of study, subject to the approval of \nGFC (e.g. interview, audition, portfolio, etc.)  \nThe admission requirements for any Faculty will be those approved by \nGFC as set forth in the current edition of the University Calendar. In \naddition to the admission requirements, selection criteria for quota \nprograms, where they exist, will also be published in the current edition \nof the University Calendar. The responsibility for admission decisions will \nbe vested in the Faculty Admission Committees or in the Deans of the \nrespective Faculties, as the councils of such Faculties will determine.” \n4. UAPPOL Admissions Procedure:  \n“PROCEDURE EFFECTIVE DATE OF CHANGES TO ADMISSION \nREGULATIONS  \nFollowing approval by GFC:  \na. Where changes to admission regulations may disadvantage students \nin the current admission cycle, normally implementation will be effective \nafter the change has been published in the University Calendar for one \nfull year (i.e., effective the second year that the information is published \nin the University Calendar). For example, a change approved in May \n Item No. 9 \nGENERAL FACULTIES COUNCIL \nFor the Meeting of September 25, 2017 \n 2005 would be first published in the 2006-2007 University Calendar in \nMarch 2006. Therefore the statement cannot come into effect until \nSeptember 2007 (affecting applicants who apply for the September 2007 \nterm beginning July 2006).”  \nb. Where changes to admission regulations are deemed by the \napproving body to be ‘advantageous to students’, normally the date of \nimplementation will be effective immediately or at the next available \nintake for the admitting Faculty. \n5.

To consider advice or recommendation from the GFC ASC on \nproposals for the establishment of or change to general University \nadmission or transfer policies affecting students, including policies \naffecting Open Studies students, and to act for GFC in approving \npolicies which in APC’s view are minor or routine; and to \nrecommend to GFC on proposals involving major change \nb. To consider advice or recommendation from GFC ASC on \nproposals which involve substantial change to admission/transfer \nor to academic standing regulations.” \n6. GFC Executive Committee Terms of Reference \n“GFC has delegated to the Executive Committee the authority to decide \nwhich items are placed on a GFC Agenda, and the order in which those \nagenda items appear on each GFC agenda. […]  \nWhen recommendations are forwarded to General Faculties Council \nfrom APC, the role of the Executive shall be to decide the order in which \nitems should be considered by GFC.

Changes to \nthese requirements began to be actively discussed in 2015.  At that time concerns were raised as to the \nwhether the existing minimum thresholds were sufficient to ensure student success. It was also noted that the \nELP requirements at the University of Alberta were lower than all our comparator institutions in the U15. \nPreliminary research conducted within the Faculty of Arts by Stuart Landon (June 2015) observed that there \nwas a positive correlation between IELTS scores and academic performance. Due to this interest and early \nresearch the Office of the Registrar conducted research more broadly and found good support for the proposed \nchanges to the minimum thresholds for IELTS and TOEFL. \nKey Issues to solve and support: \n● Student success \n● Institutional competitiveness \nAnalysis: \n● The analysis focussed on IELTS only as the most predominant method of meeting ELP  \n● Given that the six years of data used saw similar results across all year’s additional years of data have \nnot been added to the existing analysis \n● The analysis showed that the greatest gain for student success was found in elevating the IELTS band \nscore minimum from 5.0 to 5.5, raising it further did not have a large impact \n● Course withdrawal rates were not greatly impacted by a change in IELTS requirements \n● Of the students included in the analysis approximately 7% (individual years ranged from 4%-12%) \nwould no longer be admissible based on the proposed changes to the IELTS threshold \nFuture state: \n● Requirements that improve student success in first year \n● Requirements that are more consistent with other U15 institutions \n● Changes to IELTS and TOEFL will have the broadest impact on the applicant pool as they are the two \nmost predominant standardized test presented by applicants \n● IELTS change minimum band score to 5.5 (currently 5.0) with no change to the current overall score of \n6.5.  \n● TOEFL score to be increased to 90 and no change on the minimum band score of 21- The proposed \nchange in the TOEFL score is strictly the equivalent score increase to IELTS in the context of their \nscoring standard. We have included it here as it is the second most commonly used method of \nmeeting ELP. Most applicants using TOEFL are already meeting this standard. \n● Other methods of meeting ELP will be calibrated as needed and brought forth following these initial \nchanges.  \n1 IELTS and TOEFL are the most commonly presented means by which students attempt to meet ELP requirements, \nrepresenting on average 50% and 10% of the applicant pool each year respectively.  \nAttachment 2: Increase to Required English Language Proficiency (ELP) Scores for Undergraduate Admissions \n3 \nEnglish Language Proficiency Requirements for the U15 \nAccurate as of May 8, 2017 \n(Only U15 institutions offering programs delivered in English as the primary languages of instruction have been included- Universite \nLaval and Universite de Montreal have been excluded) \nInstitution IELTS TOEFL(iBT) Notes \n Total Component Total Component  \nU of A (current) 6.5 5 86 21 Applicants to teaching and health sciences disciplines \nneed a further level of spoken English Proficiency. \nA minimum score of 7.5 on IELTS Speaking or 26 on \nTOEFL speaking. \nUBC 6.5 6 90 Listening: 22 \nSpeaking & \nWriting: 21 \nU of T 6.5 6 100 Writing: 22 Discretionary Range: total score 89~99 & 19~21 on \nWriting \nMcGill 6.5 6 90 21 Education & Management: TOEFL score of 100  \nMusic: TOEFL score of 79~80 \nU of C 6.5 N/A 86 N/A Nursing: IELTS 7.0 with no components below a 7.0; \nTOEFL: 92 with no components below 23 \nEducation: IELTS 8.0 with no components below a 7.0; \nTOEFL 100 with no components below 27 \nMcMaster 6.5 5 86 20  \nWaterloo 6.5 Writing: 6.5 \nSpeaking: 6.5 \n90 Writing: 25 \nSpeaking: 25 \nAttachment 2: Increase to Required English Language Proficiency (ELP) Scores for Undergraduate Admissions \n4 \nReading: 6.0 \nListening: 6.0 \nQueens University 6.5 N/A 88 Writing:24  \nSpeaking: 22 \nReading: 22 \nListening: 20 \nDalhousie \nUniversity \n6.5 6 90 20  \nUniversity of \nManitoba \n6.5 N/A 86 20  \nU of Saskatchewan 6.5 6 86 19  \nWestern 6.5 6 83 20  \nU Ottawa \n(Programs offered \nin English) \n6.5 Writing: 6.5 86 22  \nFIRST YEAR GRADE POINT AVERAGES AND COURSE WITHDRAWALS AMONG REGISTERED HIGH \nSCHOOL AND POST-SECONDARY TRANSFER APPLICANTS WHO MET ELP REQUIREMENT BY IELTS  \n1.

GFC policy 111 Teaching and Learning and Teaching Evaluation \n“111.2 Teaching Evaluation  \n1. Evaluation of teaching at the University of Alberta serves two \npurposes: \na. Summative – Evaluation provides a review and overview of an \ninstructor’s teaching that is an essential element in promotion and tenure \ndecisions. In its summative form, teaching evaluation forms a basis for \nrewarding excellence, as well as the basis for withholding reward. \nb. Formative – Evaluation provides helpful feedback to teachers by \nidentifying teaching strengths and weaknesses and, in so doing, giving \nguidance for the improvement or refinement of teaching skills. \n2. Evaluation of teaching must be multifaceted. Multifaceted evaluation \nshall include the Universal Student Ratings of Instruction set out in \nSection 111.3 and other methods of assessing teaching designed within \nindividual Faculties to respond to the particular conditions of that \nFaculty. Such assessments shall include one or more of the following: \ninput from administrators, peers, self, undergraduate and graduate \nstudents, and alumni. \n3. Recognizing that the evaluation of teaching at the University shall be \nmultifaceted, Faculty Evaluation Committee (FEC) decisions concerning \ntenure, promotion or unsatisfactory teaching performance must be \nbased on more than one indicator of the adequacy of teaching. \n4. Assessment of teaching involving input from administrators, peers, \nself, alumni, or undergraduate and graduate students in addition to the \nUniversal Student Ratings of Instruction should occur annually prior to \ntenure. For continuing faculty (ie, Categories A1.1, A1.5 and A1.6), such \nassessment will occur at least triennially.  \n5. The University shall continue to support University Teaching Services \nin its education programming which is focused on the development and \nimprovement of teaching and learning and its efforts to enhance \nresearch in university teaching. \n111.3 Universal Student Ratings of Instruction \nIn recognition of the University's commitment to teaching, the General \nFaculties Council endorses a system of Universal Student Ratings of \nInstruction. This system, however, is only one part of the multi-faceted \napproach described in Section 111.2. \nThe Universal Student Ratings of Instruction are administered \nelectronically via a system known as the eUSRI system.   \nThe Universal Student Ratings of Instruction are designed to provide a \nminimal university-wide base of information on student ratings to the \nItem No. 10 \nGENERAL FACULTIES COUNCIL \nFor the Meeting of September 25, 2017 \n parties listed in this Section. With this purpose in mind, the General \nFaculties Council adopts the following policies: \nA. All Faculties will ensure that evaluation of all instructors and courses \nwill take place each time a course is offered. The term ‘instructors’ is \nmeant to include tenured professors, tenure-track professors, sessional \ninstructors, clinical instructors, field supervisors and graduate teaching \nassistants with responsibilities for courses. \n[…] \nD. The anonymity of student responses to the Universal Student Ratings \nof Instruction is of fundamental importance in maintaining student \nconfidentiality and encouraging the free expression of views. Under \nnormal circumstances, the anonymity of students will be protected. \nUniversal Student Ratings of Instruction offer an avenue of feedback, \nincluding feedback critical of instructors. \n[…] \nG. The numerical summaries for the ten Universal Student Ratings of \nInstruction questions will be reported to the instructor, the Chair, Director \nor Dean and students. \n[…] \nI. All results given out to students, Chairs, Directors and Deans will have \nthe following cautionary preface: \nStudent questionnaires form an important part of evaluating teaching \neffectiveness but cannot be taken alone as a complete assessment of \nan instructor or course. Factors other than an instructor’s teaching ability \nmay influence ratings. These factors include class size, class level, \nFaculty, time in class, required versus optional course, grade \nexpectations, student GPA, gender, race, ethnicity, age of both students \nand instructors. \n[…] \nJ. Nothing in this section will prevent instructors from seeking other \nmeans of feedback from students during the term.” \nThe full GFC Policy 111 Teaching and Learning and Teaching \nEvaluation is available at: \nhttp://www.gfcpolicymanual.ualberta.ca/111TeachingandLearningandTe\nach.aspx \n5. University of Alberta Faculty Agreement July 2006 (incorporating \nJune 2007 and July 2008 amendments) \n“13.06 The standards for evaluation of teaching performance shall be \nbroadly based, including course content, course design and \nperformance in the classroom. Such evaluation may take into account \ninformation such as statistical summaries of responses to student \nquestionnaires, comprehensive reviews of student commentary; reviews \nby peers, reviews by administrative officials and reviews of teaching \ndossiers and other materials provided by the staff member.” \nAttachments (each to be numbered 1 - <>) \n1.

We believe that “Robust supports, tools, and training \nto assess teaching quality, using qualitative and quantitative criteria that are fair, equitable, and meaningful \nacross disciplines” is an attainable goal towards fulfilling Objective 13 in For the Public Good:  “To inspire, \nmodel, and support excellence in teaching and learning.”    \nWe plan to use the following recommendations in our work plan:  \n1) Re-examine the overall goals of teaching assessment and evaluation at the U of A ensuring that these \ngoals:  \na. Provide the instructor with feedback to improve their teaching (formative assessment) \nb. Provide administrators with evidence of effective teaching for merit, promotion and tenure decisions \n(summative evaluation). \n2) Consult with the Faculties and the literature in order to define qualities and measures of effective teaching \nand ensure that there is a clear link between these qualities and measures. \n3) Examine GFC Policy 111. “Teaching and Learning and Teaching Evaluation” and transition this policy to \nUAPPOL.  In the process, we will: \na. Examine how decisions regarding promotion and tenure can be based on multiple indicators of effective \nteaching, including course based evaluations and more broadly on other teaching related duties.   \nb. Support consistent interpretation of multiple indicators of effective teaching across the University. \nc. Separate instructor feedback for improvement of teaching (formative assessment) and administrative \nevidence of effective teaching for merit, promotion and tenure decisions (summative evaluation) in both \npolicy and practice. \nd. Develop guidelines for the timing, depth and frequency of summative evaluations. \n4) Create a suite of assessment and evaluation tools and supports (for both faculty and administrators) with \ndefinitions, examples and specific strategies.  In developing these resources we will: \na. Investigate methods for instructors to use feedback to improve their teaching and recommend \nopportunities for teaching development, support and training.   \nb. Investigate methods and tools to support administrators in using a variety of assessment and \nevaluation strategies and recommend opportunities for training. \n5) Ensure student input is included in teaching evaluation. In our re-examination of the current methods in \nwhich student ratings are collected, we will consider:  \na. Using student input for both feedback to improve teaching and for feedback in promotion and tenure \ndecisions (formative assessment and summative evaluation), but separating these two purposes in \nboth policy and practice. \nb. Examining when student evaluations should not be used by FEC for merit, promotion or tenure \ndecisions. \nc. Shifting the emphasis of some of the student rating questions from teacher to student, looking at \nparticipation and learning in addition to instruction. \nd. Increasing the flexibility of the student rating instrument to apply to multiple teaching contexts (including \nvarious class sizes and levels) and unique needs within Faculties. \ne. Creating options within the student rating tool that allow the instructor to contextualize their course.  \nf. Examining qualitative student comments and methods to optimize their use in teaching evaluation.  \ng. Continued investigations into bias and student ratings. \nh. Standardizing methods to optimize response rates and quality of comments with the electronic student \nratings.  \nGFC COMMITTEE ON THE LEARNING ENVIRONMENT \n i.

Conclusion 9 \n5. References 10 \n6. Appendices 12 \n1 \n1. Introduction \nThe University of Alberta is committed to excellence in teaching. Its institutional strategic             \nplan, ​For the Public Good, pledges to “inspire, model, and support excellence in teaching and               \nlearning” (University of Alberta, 2016, p. 21). Evaluation of teaching plays an important role in               \nupholding this commitment by shaping the quality of instruction being offered to students.             \nUniversal Student Ratings of Instruction (USRI) questionnaires can provide ​formative          \nevaluation​, revealing areas of strength or shortcomings related to aspects of teaching, such as              \nplanning, organization, communication, and assessment. \nTeaching evaluations also affect the careers of instructors at the University of Alberta,             \nsince USRI results are used as ​summative evaluation for faculty annual review, as well as               \ntenure and promotion. This dual purpose of USRIs (summative and formative) is often             \ncontentious, ​because of their perceived weight with Faculty Evaluation Committees (FEC).           \nConsequently, in May 2016 the Committee on the Learning Environment (CLE) was tasked by              \nthe General Faculties Council (GFC) to report on research into tools for evaluation of teaching               \nby students in university courses. This was to include a critical review of the USRI, as well as an                   \noverview of possible multifaceted evaluation methods, ultimately intending to satisfy the           \nUniversity’s institutional strategic plan to “provide robust supports, tools, and training to develop             \nand assess teaching quality, using qualitative and quantitative criteria that are fair, equitable,             \nand meaningful across disciplines” (University of Alberta, 2016, p. 21). \nCLE approached their investigation with three questions:  \n1. What does the research have to say about student ratings of instruction?  \n2. How are the USRIs and other tools used in the evaluation of teaching at the               \nUniversity of Alberta?  \n3. What are some approaches for multifaceted evaluation of teaching?  \nThe purpose of this report is to address these questions and provide CLE and GFC with                \ninformation to guide future decisions on the USRI instrument and multifaceted evaluation of             \nteaching at the University of Alberta. \n2. Method \nData for this report were obtained from multiple sources. We reviewed 81 articles             \nrelating to the three questions above, beginning with literature referenced in the ​2009 CLE              \nreport Evaluation of Teaching at the U of A (Kanuka et al. 2009), which led us to more recent                   \narticles (see ​Appendix A​). We researched evaluation processes by other universities, reviewed            \nUniversity of Alberta reports and documents, and conducted interviews with University of Alberta             \ndepartment chairs (see a full report of interviews with department chairs in ​Appendix B​).  \n2.1. Student Ratings of Instruction \nInvestigation of question 1, what research has to say about student ratings of instruction,              \nincluded a review of reports and documents, which provided background information about the             \nhistory and current status of teaching evaluation at University of Alberta. These included: \n● Report from the sub-committee on evaluation of alternate-delivery courses (Erkut &           \nKreber, 2002); \n2 \nhttps://docs.google.com/document/d/1sYc7CRUexl1NlOl7JGizsYzc97Zfy439A9xbQlx8kKw/edit\nhttps://drive.google.com/open?id=0B5B3IdGb_-gwbTJmUjFvaGhTbkk\n● Evaluation of teaching at the U of A ​(Kanuka, Marentette, Braga, Campbell, Harvey,             \nHolte, Nychka, Precht, Read, Skappak, & Varnhagen, 2009); \n● AASUA position statement on URSIs ​(Association of Academic Staff University of           \nAlberta [AASUA], 2012); \n● Report of the GFC Committee on the Learning Environment subcommittee on the status             \nof the USRIs ​(​Andrews, Chelen, Connor, Kostiuk, Kwong See, & Milner, 2013​); \n● Report of the Renaissance Committee (Cheeseman, MacLaren, Carey, Glanfield, Liu,          \nMcFarlane, Cahill, Garneau, Supernant, & Szeman, 2013); and \n● GFC policy manual.​ (General Faculties Council, n.d.). \nFor this report, Test Scoring & Questionnaire Services (TSQS) at University of Alberta             \nconducted descriptive analyses that generated gender-specific USRI scores using data from the            \nacademic years 2011/12 to 2015/16. TSQS also participated in an unstructured interview about             \nthe validity, reliability, and use of USRIs at the University of Alberta. \n2.2. Evaluation of Teaching at University of Alberta \nInvestigation of question 2, how USRIs and other tools are used at University of Alberta,               \nincluded short, semi-structured interviews with department chairs (or their equivalents in           \nnon-departmental faculties). These interviews were 35-40 minutes, audio recorded, and used an            \ninterview protocol pre-approved by CLE with questions about their experiences evaluating           \nteaching (see ​Appendix C​). Interview participants were also given two sample USRI case             \nstudies representing real teaching scores and were asked to interpret the scores within the              \ncontext of their department (see ​Appendix D​). They were asked to reflect on both score sets as                 \nif both instructors were teaching different sections of the same course. All potential interview              \nparticipants were emailed directly with information about the study, including a research letter of              \ninvitation, and were encouraged to contact any member of the research team if they had               \nquestions or concerns. Data was collected from January to March 2017.  \n2.3. Multifaceted Evaluation \nInformation sources for question 3, approaches to multifaceted evaluation, included: \n● University of Alberta reports and documents (listed above);  \n● Multifaceted summative evaluation of teaching​, a symposium held in May 2015 at Centre             \nof Teaching and Learning (CTL), University of Alberta; \n● University of Alberta peer review of teaching​ (Gibson, n.d.); and \n● Interviews with department chairs.  \n3. Findings \n3.1. Student Ratings of Instruction \nInformation from University of Alberta reports and documents \nThe 2009 CLE report ​outlined a number of recommendations related to the USRI             \ninstrument and to teaching evaluation more generally, as well as GFC policy (Kanuka et al.,               \n2009). ​This report reviewed literature from up to 2008 and selected 35 articles providing insights               \n3 \nhttps://docs.google.com/document/d/1qNWd1zwfL7qAyGkSK9Duawk2CZa9QxlY8HMrrnOb1kE/edit\nhttps://docs.google.com/document/d/1eflt4J3IB-5685QR_z2TNCFXhwTlT1jMu2Ce5UHx5Wg/edit\non the following themes: validity; bias; whether students can effectively measure quality            \nteaching; the need for effective tools; correlations between grades and ratings; the impact of              \nevaluation on quality teaching; and the evaluation of faculty for tenure and promotion.  \nIn 2012, the 2009 CLE report was revisited, and the resulting 2013 CLE report, ​Report of                \nthe GFC Committee on the Learning Environment subcommittee on the status of the USRIs​, ​put               \nforward four recommendations, including that the purpose of USRIs needs to be clearly             \nidentified, and that GFC policy needs updating. It was also suggested that a “working group be                \nstruck to determine how to promote consistent interpretation and implementation of policy”            \n(Andrews et al., 2013). \nIn 2013, the Renaissance Committee, ratified by the AASUA and the Governors of the              \nUniversity of Alberta, addressed aspects of the       \nterms and conditions of work performed at the        \nUniversity of Alberta. Their report detailed a       \nnumber of concerns and made specific      \nrecommendations related to the evaluation of      \nteaching, including USRIs (​Cheeseman et al.,      \n2013)​. The committee recommended that the      \nUniversity of Alberta ​design a set of questions        \non the USRI that evaluate the effectiveness of        \nteaching​. There is no evidence to indicate that any of the recommendations from the 2009 CLE,                \n2013 CLE, or 2013 Renaissance Committee reports were pursued. See ​Appendix E for a table               \nsummarizing the positions and recommendations related to USRIs in University of Alberta            \npolicy, documents, and reports. \nReview of the literature \nIn our review of articles referenced in the 2009 CLE report, as well as articles published                \nthereafter, we organized literature relating to student ratings of instruction into two categories ​–              \nbiases and validity (see ​Appendix A​). \nBiases. ​We divided the biases category into sub-categories of gender, instructor           \ncharacteristics, the correlation between grades and ratings, nonresponse, and non-instructional          \nfactors. \n● Gender. ​The literature in this category is extensive and conflicted. Numerous articles in             \nthis subcategory report gender differences or no differences in student evaluations of            \nteaching. For example, Boring, Ottoboni, and Stark (2016) concluded that student           \nratings are “biased against female instructors by an amount that is large and statistically              \nsignificant.” On the other hand, Wright and Jenkins-Guarieri (2012) conducted a           \nmeta-analysis of 193 studies and concluded that student evaluations appear to be free             \nfrom gender bias. The University of Alberta TSQS conducted descriptive analyses and            \nthe results showed there is no apparent difference between scores for males (​N ​=              \n18576, ​Mdn ​= 4.53) and females (​N ​= 13679, ​Mdn = 4.57) for statement 211 ​(“overall the                 \ninstructor was excellent”)​. \n● Instructor characteristics. ​Article findings in this sub-category, seven articles total, were           \nthat: instructor personality positively correlates with student evaluations (Clayson, 2013;          \n4 \nhttps://docs.google.com/document/d/11hFvMpGYeT9BWjW7iWcdFrFE0W11oALycSs2MprsaRY/edit\nhttps://docs.google.com/document/d/1sYc7CRUexl1NlOl7JGizsYzc97Zfy439A9xbQlx8kKw/edit\nKim & MacCann, 2016); instructor physical attractiveness positively correlates with          \nstudent evaluations on   \nRateMyProfessor.com (Felton, Mitchell,   \n& Stinson, 2004); instructor age     \nnegatively correlates with student    \nevaluations on RateMyProfessor.com   \n(Stonebraker & Stone, 2015) and     \ninstructor age impacts negatively on perceptions of teachers and anticipated rapport in            \nthe classroom based on photographs (Wilson, Beyer, & Monteiro, 2014); instructor           \nposition (limited term lecturer versus full time faculty) does affect student evaluations            \n(Cho & Otani, 2014); and instructor rank (i.e. achievement of tenure) does not affect              \nstudent evaluations (Cheng, 2015). \n● Correlation between grades and ratings. Most literature, seven articles in this           \nsub-category, reported that students receiving higher grades tended to provide more           \nfavourable evaluations of teaching. Cho, Baek, and Cho (2015) found this to be true in               \ntheir research study and suggested that it might be a psychological “gift” from the              \nstudent to the instructor. However, two articles suggested otherwise, such as an analysis             \nof 50,000 courses by Centra (2003) that debunked the correlation between expected            \ngrades and student evaluations. \n● Nonresponse. ​Nonresponse bias occurs when students choose not to participate in an            \nevaluation of teaching, and the missing data may cause skewed results. Three articles in              \nthis sub-category reported that nonresponse bias does influence student evaluations of           \nteaching. For example, Macfadyen, Dawson, Prest, and Gasevic (2016) uncovered that           \n“respondent pools do not fully represent the distribution of students in courses.” No             \narticles suggested otherwise. \n● Non-instructional. Non-instructional bias occurs when circumstances beyond the control         \nof an instructor ​– ​such as class type,        \ntime, size, and semester ​– ​influence      \nstudent evaluation of teaching. The four      \narticles in this sub-category varied in      \ntheir investigations and conclusions. For     \nexample, Nargundkar and Shrikhande    \n(2014) studied numerous factors and     \nconcluded that the combined impact was      \nstatistically significant; Reardon, Leierer, and Lee (2014) determined that class schedule           \ndoes not affect ratings. \nIt should be noted that GFC Policy 111.3 (I) also recognizes student bias may impact the                \nevaluation of an instructor.  \nValidity. ​Validity refers to the extent that an instrument or procedure measures what it              \nintends to measure, and the extendibility of the results to other situations. Literature within this               \ncategory equally supports opposing viewpoints as to whether or not student evaluations of             \nteaching are valid measures of teaching quality; whether or not students have the knowledge,              \nskills, or motivation to measure teaching quality. For example, Grammatikopoulos, Linardakis,           \n5 \nGregoriadis, and Oikonomidis (2015) found an instrument used in the Greek higher education             \nsystem to be valid, whereas Lama, Arias, Mendoza, and Manahan (2015) stated that students              \nat an Australian university completed surveys without diligence. A meta-analysis by Uttl, White,             \nand Gonzalez (2016) re-analyzed meta-analytic data from Cohen (1981) and concluded that            \nstudent evaluations of teaching did not indicate teaching quality. Marsh and Roche (1997) found              \nthat student evaluations correlated with those of peers and trained evaluators, whereas            \nUijtdehaage and O’Neal (2015) reported that students mindlessly evaluated a fictitious           \ninstructor, even when a photograph was provided. During this project, our research team was              \nnot able to find information on the validity of the USRI instrument at the University of Alberta .  1\nRelated to validity is the impact of student evaluations on teaching quality. In our review               \nof the literature, five articles were divided as to whether or not results from student evaluations                \nhad a positive impact on teaching quality. For example, Makondo and Ndebele (2014) reported              \nthat lecturers perceive student feedback as valuable for building their teaching skills, yet ​Stein,              \nSpiller, Harris, Deaker, and Kennedy (2013) argued that evaluation data ​is not being used              \neffectively for professional development. In a 2011 survey of 564 academic staff at the              \nUniversity of Alberta, 69.2% of respondents agreed that ​qualitative comments on USRIs helped             \nimprove the quality of their teaching; 49.5% stated that the USRI’s ​quantitative scores were not               \nhelpful in this regard (AASUA, 2012).  \nInformation from other universities \nThe general consensus that student input should be sought related to their experience             \nwith course instruction and the learning environment is evident in the practices of institutions              \nother than the University of Alberta​. ​For example, in 2015 Stanford University introduced a new               \nend-of-term course evaluation instrument that included nine required items and additional           \ncustomizable, open- or closed-ended questions (​Stanford University VPTL, n.d.​). \nSome institutions use multiple instruments to seek insight on students’ perceptions of            \nteaching and learning, as well as the broader context of the student experience. ​For example,               \nboth University of Oxford and University of Sydney have recently adopted “The Student             \nBarometer”, which includes the learning experience, living experience, support services, and           \nother areas (​I-graduate, n.d.​). This measure is administered once per year and aims to “track               \nand compare the decision-making, expectations, perceptions and intentions of students from           \napplication to graduation” (University of Sydney, 2016a, para. 2). The University of Oxford also              \nemploys department-specific evaluation mechanisms, as well as the “National Student Survey”           \nfor undergraduate students in the last year of their program (​Ipsos MORI, n.d.​; University of               \nOxford, 2015, p. 7). \nUniversity of Sydney uses a “Student Experience Survey” for undergraduate students in            \ntheir first and final year of their program, as well as a mandatory online “Unit of Study Survey                  \n(USS)” with eight required items (six quantitative, two open response) and up to four              \nfaculty-specific quantitative items and one faculty-specific open response item (​University of           \nSydney, 2016b​). Each faculty can also have up to four USS versions to allow customization of                \n1 ​TSQS measures the reliability of the USRI by comparing medians to the previous academic \nyears. \n6 \nhttps://vptl.stanford.edu/teaching-learning/teaching-practices/evaluation-feedback/stanfords-new-course-evaluations/standard\nhttps://www.i-graduate.org/services/student-barometer/\nhttp://sydney.edu.au/education-portfolio/ei/ses/\nhttp://sydney.edu.au/education-portfolio/ei/ses/\nhttp://www.thestudentsurvey.com/\nthe survey for different contexts (University of Sydney, 2016c). ​Taken together, the examples             \nprovided here highlight that other institutions value student feedback on the teaching and             \nlearning environment and are making efforts to update and improve the instruments they utilize              \nto obtain this feedback. \nIn summary ​for question 1, what research has to say about student ratings of instruction,               \nwe conclude that the topic of survey tools is prevalent the literature, often around the concerns                \nof biases or validity. It is evident that universities globally value student feedback and are               \nworking to implement high-quality instruments. University of Alberta reports and documents           \nhave historically addressed the USRI, making recommendations for the instrument and           \nUniversity policy; however, there is no indication suggestions made in these reports have had              \nany traction. \n3.2. Evaluation of Teaching at University of Alberta \nInformation from interviews with department chairs \nInterview participants from all faculties other than Faculty of Medicine and Dentistry            \n(FOMD) reported using USRIs scores and comments to evaluate teaching; only a portion of              \nFOMD participants reported using this tool. Department chairs revealed that, although they try             \nto consider all the USRI statements, they focus primarily on USRI statement 221 (“overall the               \ninstructor was excellent”), and statement 25 (“overall the quality of the course content was              \nexcellent”) as indicators of effective teaching. \nMost participants stated that they     \napproach the interpretation of USRI results      \nwith a contextual attitude, indicating that      \nUSRIs should be understood in light of       \ninstructor characteristics and   \nnon-instructional elements. \nParticipants identified several issues    \nwith using USRIs exclusively to evaluate      \nteaching, which aligned with our review of the        \nliterature, such as biases with gender,      \ninstructor characteristics, and   \nnon-instructional factors. Most department    \nchairs voiced their need for additional      \nsupports to better evaluate teaching. Although      \nsome recommended possible alternatives to     \nsupplement USRI scores, they still expressed      \nhope that the institution would provide      \nsolutions for their concerns. \nParticipants also raised the issue of using       \nUSRIs for purposes of tenure and promotion.       \nThe 2009 CLE report mentioned this concern,       \nand our review of the literature included seven        \n7 \narticles concerning the use of student surveys for summative purposes, and misinterpretation of             \ntheir results leading to incorrect conclusions.  \nIn summary for question 2, ‘how USRIs and other tools are used at University of Alberta’,                \nwe conclude that ​participants from all faculties other than FOMD consistently use USRIs scores              \nand comments to evaluate teaching. Department chairs focus on one or two statements as a               \nbarometer of effective teaching, and although most approach interpretation of results with a             \ncontextual attitude, they also recognize issues with the USRI that are consistent with our review               \nof the literature, specifically perceived issues of bias, validity, and concerns about potential             \nmisinterpretations of student survey results for the summative purposes of tenure and            \npromotion. \n3.3. Multifaceted Evaluation \nAccording to Lyde, Grieshaber, & Byrns (2016), a ​comprehensive system of teaching            \nevaluation is necessary due to the limitations of student surveys and the complex nature of               \nteaching performance. In our review of articles referenced in the 2009 CLE report, as well as                \nmore recently, ten articles recognized the need for instruments that are of high psychometric              \nquality, and also that evaluations should include multiple sources of information, such as             \nsurveys, peer evaluations, self-evaluations, focus groups, and more.  \nReference to multifaceted evaluation is found in University of Alberta documents and            \nreports discussed earlier. The 2009 CLE report commented that an imprecise definition of             \nteaching excellence in section 111.1 of the GFC policy exacerbates the lack of guidance              \nprovided to individual faculties for multifaceted evaluation (Kanuka et al., 2009, pp. 21-22). The              \n2013 CLE report recommended the creation of a resource to guide faculties with “possibilities              \nand/or examples” of multifaceted evaluation (Andrews et al., 2013).  \nIn May 2015, the Centre for Teaching and Learning (CTL) hosted a symposium entitled              \nMultifaceted Summative Evaluation of Teaching​, wherein some recommendations for best          \npractice were brought forward. Key points included: \n● University of Alberta policy needs to include a clear definition of teaching excellence,             \nincluding a specific set of criteria of effective teaching that can be used for purposes of                \nevaluation; these criteria should be shared with faculty, instructors and students. \n● Both formative and summative evaluation of teaching should be multifaceted, collecting           \nmultiple sources of evidence at multiple times annually.  \n● A multifaceted teaching evaluation plan should be developed to supplement University           \npolicy, including definitions, examples, evaluation procedures, and specific strategies for          \ntraining and support. \nApproaches to multifaceted evaluation \nThe 2013 Renaissance Committee report highlighted the importance of rigorous,          \nmultifaceted evaluation, which was described as information “collected through a variety of            \nmethods and assessed at multiple points in time” (Cheeseman et al., 2013, p. 7, 69). “The array                 \ncan include student ratings of courses, a teaching dossier, peer observations, external reviews             \nof content, reflection of the teacher (self-assessment), administrator reviews of content and            \ncourse observation, review of published work on teaching Scholarship, and evidence supporting            \n8 \nhttps://www.ualberta.ca/centre-for-teaching-and-learning/events/symposium-series/past-symposia/multifaceted-summative-evaluation-teaching\nthe reputation of the teacher in the field(s) of instruction, within and without the University”               \n(Cheeseman et al., p. 70). See ​Appendix F for a table summarizing the positions and               \nrecommendations related to multifaceted evaluation in University of Alberta policy, documents,           \nand reports. \nPeer review of teaching. Gibson (n.d.), author of ​University of Alberta Peer Review of              \nTeaching (an online article provided as a resource for the 2015 CTL symposium), defined peer               \nreview of teaching as “informed collegial assessment of faculty teaching for either fostering             \nimprovement or making personnel decisions” and stated that both formative and summative            \nmethods were required for comprehensive teaching evaluation (para 5). Gibson explained that            \nwhile quantitative student questionnaires provide information about day-to-day classroom         \ninteraction, peer review can broaden this to aspects, such as “course content, academic rigor              \nand appropriateness of objectives and topics;… subject matter expertise; instructional materials           \nand methods; and, assessment and grading” (para 3). Gibson outlined six phases of summative              \npeer review and provided eighteen appendices of practical resources, such as sample            \nobservation tools and reports. \nTeaching dossiers (portfolios). ​A teaching dossier serves “to facilitate the presentation of            \na faculty member’s teaching achievements and major strengths for self-assessment and           \ninterpretation by others\" (Day, Robberecht & Roed, 1996, p. 1). They are a cumulative record of                \none’s teaching activities and often include: “(a) a statement regarding the faculty member’s             \nteaching philosophy, goals, and strategies; (b) a description of teaching (planning, preparing,            \nand teaching courses; assessing student learning; and giving feedback); (c) an evaluation of             \nteaching accomplishments; and (d) suggestions regarding possible changes for future teaching”           \n(Day et al.,1996, p. 1). Teaching dossiers require instructors to gather multiple sources of              \nevidence and define the value of their scholarship in teaching (Cheeseman et al., 2013).              \nRelated to summative evaluation of teaching, the 2013 Renaissance Committee report           \nrecommended that “​a teaching dossier, following CTL standards, should be part of all tenure              \nand promotion packages” (Cheeseman et al., 2013, p. 70). A document from the ​University of               \nSydney​ provides a comprehensive list of data sources instructors may include in a dossier.  \nInterviews with department chairs​. Participants indicated having already implemented         \nsome approaches for multi-faceted evaluation of teaching. In-class peer observation was the            \nmost commonly used additional source of information, followed by annual instructor pedagogical            \nself-reflections. Some departments chairs    \nhave also implemented yearly faculty     \naudits, in which a small portion of their        \nprofessoriate teaching is evaluated in a      \nmore comprehensive way, and using a      \nvariety of supplementary sources of     \ninformation. Participants indicated,   \nhowever, that they mostly obtain these      \nextra resources on a voluntary basis (only       \nwhen professors agree to provide them),      \nand even when they do obtain these resources, not all of them bring this information to FEC.                 \n9 \nhttps://docs.google.com/document/d/1X6E4VtHWARCopnvqFoGIPb9FSZZpH3HugEBSSrXGFRM/edit\nhttps://www.ualberta.ca/centre-for-teaching-and-learning/events/symposium-series/past-symposia/multifaceted-summative-evaluation-teaching/peer-review-of-teaching\nhttp://sydney.edu.au/education-portfolio/ei/programs/teaching_insights/pdf/insight7_evidence.pdf\nhttp://sydney.edu.au/education-portfolio/ei/programs/teaching_insights/pdf/insight7_evidence.pdf\nhttps://www.ualberta.ca/centre-for-teaching-and-learning/events/symposium-series/past-symposia/multifaceted-summative-evaluation-teaching/peer-review-of-teaching\nThey voiced their need for additional institutional supports to better evaluate teaching with a              \nmulti-faceted approach, and they hope the institution will provide a solution. \nIn summary for question 3, approaches to multifaceted evaluation, we conclude that:            \nthere are numerous potential evaluative methods in addition to student surveys; multifaceted            \nevaluation is encouraged by several University reports and documents and literature in general,             \nas well as mandated by University policy; yet this has not yet translated into its consistent or                 \nformal implementation across faculties en masse. \n4. Conclusion \nThe purpose of this report is to support CLE with their investigation into student ratings               \nof instruction, the use of USRIs and other evaluation tools at the University of Alberta, and                \napproaches for multifaceted evaluation of teaching.  \nQuestion 1, w​hat does the research have to say about student ratings of instruction?  \nResearch around student ratings of instruction primarily point to concerns about biases            \nand validity of survey tools and results. The perspective that student feedback is valuable to               \nhelp ensure high-quality teaching environments, yet that survey tools are imperfect and limited             \nfor a comprehensive evaluation of teaching, is shared by universities globally.  \nQuestion 2, how are the USRIs and other tools used in the evaluation of teaching at the                 \nUniversity of Alberta? \nSemi-structured interviews with department chairs revealed that USRIs are the primary           \nsource of teaching evaluation information for all faculties except FOMD. Specifically, most            \ndepartment chairs indicated that they start with only one or two statements but they do their best                 \nto contextualize the numerical results. Some department chairs expressed concerns around           \nbiases, validity, and the potential for misinterpretation of USRI results for summative purposes             \nof promotion and tenure decisions. \nQuestion 3, what are some approaches for multifaceted evaluation of teaching?  \nMultifaceted evaluation is supported by the literature and is also mandated by GFC             \npolicy. However, impeding its University-wide adoption and consistency is a lack of support and              \ntime for those responsible for conducting such robust, comprehensive evaluations of teaching.            \nMoving forward, systematic and purposeful evaluation of teaching can only materialize if there             \nare realistic and tangible expectations, and supports (documents, workshops, etc.). \n5.

Also, an “other” category \nincludes articles that focused on multiple biasing factors, biasing factors that do not fit into any \nother category, or biases in general. \n Biases, Gender. ​Most literature, seven articles in this sub-category, reported that an \ninstructor’s gender does influence student evaluations of teaching; however, two articles \nsuggest otherwise. \nGender influences student ratings Gender does not influence student ratings \nBoring, Ottoboni, & Stark (2016): ratings are \nbiased against female instructors by an \namount that is large and statistically \nsignificant \nGehrt, Louie, & Osland (2015): female \nstudents evaluated female lower-ranked \nfaculty most favorably; male students \nevaluations were more favorable for lower \nranked male faculty, but they did not degrade \nhigher ranked female faculty \nHuebner & Magel (2015): variances of the \nclass average responses between male and \nfemale faculty were higher for male faculty \nLaube, Massoni, Sprague, & Ferber (2007): \nthe inconsistency on the question of whether \nstudent evaluations are gendered is itself an \nartifact of the way that quantitative measures \ncan mask underlying gender bias \nMacNell, Driscoll, & Hunt (2015): students \nrate males significantly higher than females \nMiles & House (2015): lower ratings for \nfemale instructors teaching larger required \nclasses \nWilson, Beyer, & Monteiro (2014): lower \nratings for older instructors, but more so for \nfemales than males \nCentra & Gaubatz (2000): only small \nsame-gender preferences found, particularly \nwith females \nSmith, Yoo, Farr, Salmon, & Miller (2007): \nmale and female students rated female \ninstructors more highly; effect was small but \nsignificant due to sample size  \nWright & Jenkins-Guarieri (2012): SETs \nappear to be valid and free from gender bias \n Biases, Instructor characteristics​ ​(appearance, personality, age, and/or rank). Article \nfindings in this sub-category, seven articles total, were that: instructor personality positively \ncorrelates with student evaluations; instructor physical attractiveness positively correlates with \nstudent evaluations; instructor age negatively correlates with student evaluations; instructor \nrank does affect student evaluations; and instructor rank does not affect student evaluations.  \nInstructor characteristics influence \nstudent ratings \nInstructor characteristics do not \ninfluence student ratings \nCho & Otani (2014): students give higher \nratings for limited-term lecturers versus \nfull-time faculty \nClayson (2013): students’ first perceptions of \nan instructor’s personality are significantly \nrelated to ratings at the end of the semester \nFelton, Mitchell, & Stinson (2004): students \ngive attractively-rated professors higher \nquality and easiness scores  \nKim & MacCann (2016): students’ expressed \neducational satisfaction was related to \nperceptions of instructor personality \nStonebraker & Stone (2015): age has a \nnegative impact on student ratings of faculty \nmembers; begins around mid-forties; offset by \nattractiveness \nWilson, Beyer, & Monteiro (2014): lower \nratings for older instructors, but more so for \nfemales than males \nCheng (2015): tenure does not have a \nsignificant impact on student ratings of \nteaching performance \n Biases, Correlation between grades and ratings. ​Most literature, seven articles in this \nsub-category, reported that students receiving higher grades tend to provide more favourable \nevaluations of teaching; however, two articles suggest otherwise. \nThere is a correlation between higher \ngrades and higher ratings \nThere is not a correlation between higher \ngrades and higher ratings \nBacker (2012): some students punish \nacademics for failing grades with low ratings \nBlackhart, Peruche, DeWall, & Joiner (2006): \nhigher ratings given to instructors who give \nhigher grades, and also to graduate teaching \nassistant rank \nBoring, Ottoboni, & Stark (2016): ratings​ are \nmore sensitive to students’ grade \nexpectations than they are to teaching \neffectiveness \nCho, Baek, & Cho (2015): students with better \ngrades than their expected grades provide a \npsychological “gift” to their teachers by giving \nhigher ratings \nGreenwald & Gillmore (1997): the \ngrades-ratings correlation is due to an \nunwanted influence of instructors' grading \nleniency; there are 5 theories of the \ngrades-ratings correlation \nMaurer (2006): cognitive dissonance may be \na theory to explain the grades-ratings \ncorrelation \nMiles & House (2015): higher expected \ngrades may lead to higher ratings \nCentra (2003): expected grades generally do \nnot affect student evaluations \nGump (2007): questions the validity of \nresearch done on the leniency hypothesis \n Biases, Nonresponse.​ ​Nonresponse bias occurs when students choose not to participate in \nevaluation of teaching, and the missing data may cause skewed results. Three articles in this \nsub-category reported that nonresponse bias does influence student evaluations of teaching. \nNo articles suggested otherwise. \nNonresponse bias influences student \nratings \nNonresponse bias does not influence \nstudent ratings \nKuwaiti, AlQuraan, & Subbarayalu (2016): \nratings are affected by class size and \nresponse rate \nMacfadyen, Dawson, Prest, & Gasevic \n(2016): ratings affected by who is completing \nthe surveys \nReisenwitz (2015): ​there are significant \ndifferences between those who complete \nonline student evaluations and those who do \nnot \nNo articles found. \n Biases, Non-Instructional. ​Non-instructional bias occurs when circumstances beyond the \ncontrol of an instructor, such as class type, time, size, and semester, influence student \nevaluation of teaching.

Differences in variances of class averages are also examined for male and female \nfaculty. Tests are conducted by first considering all classes across the entire university and \nthen classes just within the College of Science and Mathematics.

Drawing on insights developed from sociological scholarship on \ngender and evaluation, we argue that the apparent inconsistency on the question of whether \nstudent evaluations are gendered is itself an artifact of the way that quantitative measures can \nmask underlying gender bias. \nMacNell, Driscoll, & Hunt​ (2015): students rate males significantly higher than females \nMacNell, L., Driscoll, A., & Hunt, A.

The present research pulls together a substantial amount of data to \nstatistically analyze several academic historical legends about just how vulnerable STEs are \nto the effects of: class size, course type, professor gender, and course grades. \nDesign/methodology/approach: This research is utilizes over 30,000 individual student \nevaluations of 255 professors, spanning six semesters, during a three year time period to test \nsix hypotheses. The final sample represents 1057 classes ranging in size between 10 and \n190 students. Each hypothesis is statistically analyzed, with either analysis of variance or a \nRegression model. Findings: This study finds support for 5 out of 6 hypotheses. Specifically, \nthese data suggest STEs are likely to be closest to \"5\" (using a 1-5 scale with 5 being highest) \nin small elective classes, and lowest in large required classes taught by females. As well we \nfind support for the notion that higher expected course grades may lead to higher STEs.  \nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.5430/ijhe.v4n2p116\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10755-014-9313-4\nSmith, Yoo, Farr, Salmon, & Miller​ ​(2007): male and female students rated female \ninstructors more highly; effect was small but significant due to sample size \nSmith, S.

During this eight-year period, 120 assistant \nprofessors received tenure and 83 associate professors attained full rank. A \ndifferences-in-differences model controlling for teaching experience, study hours, response \nrate, and unobserved heterogeneity among terms, courses, and professors suggests that for \na given professor, tenure does not have a significant impact on student ratings of teaching \nperformance, at least in the immediate years after advancement.

Data were analyzed \nusing a general linear regression model to investigate the influence of multi-dimensional \nevaluation items on the overall rating item (Overall, I would rate the instructor of this course as \noutstanding) on the SET. Results showed that students provided higher ratings for LTLs than \nFTF, but they value different items when rating the overall evaluation of LTLs and FTF. Some \nsurvey items (for instance, those about instructor planning and enthusiasm) influence more on \nthe rating of the overall item for LTLs than for FTF, whereas other, multi-dimensional items \n(for instance, those about assessment strategies and instructor's availability) influence more \non the overall rating for FTF than for LTLs. \nClayson​ (2013): students’ first perceptions of an instructor’s personality are significantly \nrelated to ratings at the end of the semester \nhttp://opus.ipfw.edu/profstudies_facpubs/64\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09645292.2013.826632\nClayson, D.

Using the self-selected data from this public forum, we \nexamine the relations between quality, easiness, and sexiness for 3190 professors at 25 \nuniversities. For faculty with at least ten student posts, the correlation between quality and \neasiness is 0.61, and the correlation between quality and sexiness is 0.30. Using simple linear \nregression, we find that about half of the variation in quality is a function of easiness and \nsexiness. When grouped into sexy and non-sexy professors, the data reveal that students \ngive sexy-rated professors higher quality and easiness scores.  \nKim & MacCann​ (2016): students’ expressed educational satisfaction was related to \nperceptions of instructor personality \nKim, L.

Both absolute personality \npreferences (certain traits are universally desired) and relative personality preferences \n(certain traits are desired relative to students' own level of the trait) are examined among 137 \nfirst year mathematics students (Study 1) and 378 first year psychology students (Study 2). \nStudents provided Big Five personality ratings for themselves, their actual instructor, and their \nideal instructor. Supporting the absolute preference hypothesis, students rated their ideal \ninstructor as having significantly higher levels than both themselves and the general \npopulation on all five personality domains (except for openness in Study 1), with particularly \nlarge effect sizes for emotional stability and conscientiousness. Supporting the relative \npreference hypothesis, students also rated their ideal instructor as having a similar Big Five \nprofile to themselves. Moreover, if their actual instructor's personality was similar to their ideal \ninstructor's personality, students showed greater educational satisfaction (but not higher \nperformance self-efficacy nor academic achievement). \nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/0260293032000158180\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/08832323.2011.633580\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/0260293032000158180\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.paid.2016.06.068\nStonebraker & Stone​ (2015): age has a negative impact on student ratings of faculty \nmembers; begins around mid-forties; offset by attractiveness \nStonebraker, R.

Age has a negative impact on \nstudent ratings of faculty members that is robust across genders, groups of academic \ndisciplines and types of institutions. However, the effect does not begin until faculty members \nreach their mid-forties and does not seem to increase even when they reach the former \nretirement ages of 65 or 70. Moreover, the quantitative impact of age on student ratings is \nsmall and can be offset by other factors, especially the physical appearance of professors and \nhow easy students consider them to be. When we restrict our sample to those professors \ndeemed hot by student raters, the effect of age disappears completely. \nWilson, Beyer, & Monteiro​ (2014): lower ratings for older instructors, but more so for \nfemales than males \nWilson, J.

In fact, contrary to \nwhat some faculty think, courses in natural sciences with expected grades of A were rated \nlower, not higher. Courses were rated lower when they were rated as either difficult or too \nelementary.

As some students are randomly able to see \ntheir grades prior to the evaluation, the “natural” experiment provides a unique opportunity for \ntesting the hypothesis as to whether there exists a possibility of a hedonic (implicit) exchange \nbetween the students’ grades and teaching evaluations. Students with good grades tend to \nhighly rate the teaching quality of their instructors, in comparison with those who receive \nrelatively poor grades. This study finds that students with better grades than their expected \ngrades provide a psychological “gift” to their teachers by giving a higher teacher evaluation, \nwhereas it is the opposite with those students receiving lower grades than their expectation. \nGreenwald & Gillmore​ (1997): the grades-ratings correlation is due to an unwanted influence \nof instructors' grading leniency; there are 5 theories of the grades-ratings correlation \nGreenwald, A.

The authors identify 4 additional data patterns that, \ncollectively, discriminate among 5 theories of the grades-ratings correlation. The presence of \nall 4 of these markers in student ratings data (obtained at University of Washington) was most \nconsistent with the theory that the grades-ratings correlation is due to an unwanted influence \nof instructors' grading leniency on ratings. This conclusion justifies use of a statistical \ncorrection – illustrated here with actual ratings data – to remove the unwanted inflation of \nratings produced by lenient grading. Additional research can profitably seek other \ninappropriate influences on ratings to identify more opportunities for validity-enhancing \nadjustments. \nGump​ (2007): questions the validity of research done on the leniency hypothesis \nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.econedurev.2015.10.001\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1037/0003-066X.52.11.1209\nGump, S.E.

In this diverse literature, research methods and aims have frequently affected the \noutcomes and conclusions, since SETs are typically context-specific instruments whose \nresults, in isolated instances, do not generalize well. Thus this review questions the very \ngeneralizability of the massive and often contradictory SET-related literature on the leniency \nhypothesis and argues that future research must be designed and carried out in light of the \nimplicit problems existing in the majority of earlier studies. \nMaurer​ (2006): cognitive dissonance may be a theory to explain the grades-ratings \ncorrelation \nMaurer, T.

Cognitive dissonance \ntheory holds that students who expect poor grades rate instructors poorly to minimize ego \nthreat whereas the revenge theory holds that students rate instructors poorly in an attempt to \npunish them. I tested both theories via an experimental manipulation of the perceived ability to \npunish instructors through course evaluations. Results indicated that student ratings appear \nunrelated to the ability to punish instructors, thus supporting cognitive dissonance theory. \nAlternative interpretations of the data suggest further research is warranted. \nMiles & House​ (2015): higher expected grades may lead to higher ratings \nMiles, P., & House, D.

Using questions from the UK’s National \nStudent Survey, the study examined whether and how students’ expressed satisfaction with \nissues such as feedback promptness and instructor enthusiasm depends on the context of \ncomparison (such as possibly inaccurate beliefs about the feedback promptness or \nenthusiasm experienced at other universities) that is evoked. Experiment 1 found strong \neffects of experimentally provided comparison context—for example, satisfaction with a given \nfeedback time depended on the time’s relative position within a context.

It found that these beliefs vary widely \nand that students’ satisfaction was predicted by how they believed their experience ranked \nwithin the distribution of others’ experiences. A third study found that relative judgment \nprinciples also predicted students’ intention to complain. An extended model was developed \nto show that purely rank-based principles of judgment can account for findings previously \nattributed to range effects. It was concluded that satisfaction ratings and quality of provision \nare different quantities, particularly when the implicit context of comparison includes beliefs \nabout provision at other universities. Quality and satisfaction should be assessed separately, \nwith objective measures (such as actual times to feedback), rather than subjective ratings \n(such as satisfaction with feedback promptness), being used to measure quality wherever \npracticable.  \nChen & Hoshower​ (2003): student motivation to participate in SET affects ratings \nChen, Y., & Hoshower, L.

The \nauthors suggest that caution should be exercised in the use of student evaluations. \nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/0260293032000033071\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/0260293032000033071\nhttp://login.ezproxy.library.ualberta.ca/login?url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=bth&AN=7214031&site=eds-live&scope=site\nhttp://login.ezproxy.library.ualberta.ca/login?url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=bth&AN=7214031&site=eds-live&scope=site\nCohen​ (1981): student ratings are a valid measure of teaching effectiveness; this is the \nmeta-analysis targeted by Uttl et al., 2016 \nCohen, P.

The purpose of this study was to psychometrically \nassess short students evaluation of teaching (SET) forms using the UAE University form as a \nmodel. The study evaluated the form validity, reliability, the overall question, and potential \nbias with respect to gender, college, grade point average, expected grade, and class size. A \ntotal of 3,661 students participated in this study in different random samples. Results \nindicated that the short SET form lacked content validity and could not identify key dimensions \nof evaluating teaching effectiveness. The form showed stability over time and acceptable \ninternal reliability. Results indicated also that there was a potential bias due to college, \nexpected grade, and class size, but there was no relationship between grade point average \nand students' ratings.

The aim of this study was to investigate to what \ndegree students are able to differentiate between tutors with different tutoring deficiencies, \nhow effective tutors are with different deficiencies and what kind of tips students give for \nimprovement of a tutor's behaviour. The results of this study demonstrate that students are \nnot only able to distinguish between poor and excellent tutors, but are also able to diagnose \ntutors with different tutoring deficiencies and are able to provide tutors with specific feedback \nto improve their performance. \nGinns, Prosser, & Barrie​ (2007): the SET tool studied supports quality assurance and \nimprovement processes at the university \nGinns, P., Prosser, M., & Barrie, S.

Confirmatory factor analyses supported the hypothesised factor structure, and \nestimates of inter-rater agreement on SCEQ scales indicated student ratings of degrees can \nbe meaningfully aggregated up to the faculty level. Derived from a substantial research base, \nlinking the student experience to approaches to study and learning outcomes, its goal is to \nsupport both quality assurance and improvement processes within the university, at both the \ndegree level and faculty level.

Overall, it was found that students who provided low \nevaluations in their first year were also likely to do so in their third year.

By the early 1980s, however, most expert opinion viewed student \nrating measures as valid and as worthy of widespread use. In retrospect, older \ndiscriminant-validity concerns were not so much resolved as they were displaced from \nresearch attention by accumulating evidence for convergent validity. This article introduces a \nCurrent Issues section that gives new attention to validity concerns associated with student \nratings. The section's 4 articles deal, respectively, with (a) conceptual structure (are student \nratings unidimensional or multidimensional?), (b) convergent validity (how well do ratings \ncorrelate with other indicators of effective teaching?), (c) discriminant validity (are ratings \ninfluenced by factors other than teaching effectiveness?), and (d) consequential validity (are \nratings used effectively in personnel development and evaluation?). Although all 4 articles \nfavor the use of ratings, they disagree on controversial points associated with interpretation \nand use of ratings data. \nKhong​ (2014): SET is a valid instrument in evaluating teaching effectiveness \nhttp://psycnet.apa.org/doi/10.1037/0003-066X.52.11.1182\nhttp://journals.sfu.ca/cjhe/index.php/cjhe/article/view/184404\nhttp://psycnet.apa.org/doi/10.1037/0003-066X.52.11.1182\nhttp://journals.sfu.ca/cjhe/index.php/cjhe/article/view/184404\nKhong, T.

To address the complexity inherent \nin these problems, we suggest the use of focus groups as an alternative approach or \ncomplement to the standard SETs. A recommended format and guidelines for running \nclassroom focus groups are provided. Institutional constraints and implementation concerns \nare addressed as well. This article lays the foundation for implementing a change in student \nassessment of teaching by proposing a method to compensate for bias in SETs, using focus \ngroups as an evaluation tool, either as a stand-alone process or as a supplement to current \nmethods. \nMcKeachie​ (1997): student ratings are valid but affected by contextual variables such as \ngrading leniency \nMcKeachie, W.

We found that the original instrument \nthat was validated about 20 years ago is still valid, with factor analysis showing that the six \nunderlying dimensions used in the instrument remained relatively intact. Also, we found that \nthe relative importance of those six factors in the overall assessment of instruction changed \nover the past two decades, reflecting changes in the expectations of the current millennial \ngeneration of students.

The low value of inter-rater reliability stresses that any solid conclusions on \nteaching cannot be made on the basis of single feedbacks. To assess a teacher’s general \nteaching effectiveness, one needs to evaluate four randomly chosen course implementations. \nTwo implementations are needed when one course is evaluated, and if one implementation is \nevaluated, up to 15 feedbacks are needed. The stability of students’ ratings is very high, \nwhich reflects students’ stable rating criteria. There is an obvious rating paradox: from the \nstudent’s point of view, each rating is very precise, stable and justifiable, but from the \nteacher’s point of view a single feedback reflects the quality of teaching to just a moderate \nextent. Cross-hierarchical analysis reveals that there are large discrepancies between the \nuses of rating scales; some students are systematically more lenient in their rating whereas \nothers are systematically more severe. The study also reveals that some courses are \ngenerally rated more favourably and that some courses are more suitable for certain teachers. \nSocha​ (2013): a SET instrument was found to have overall good reliability and validity with \nrelatively few biases \nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1540-4609.2011.00328.x\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1540-4609.2011.00328.x\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02602938.2011.625471\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02602938.2011.625471\nSocha, A.

The review is based on the SET \nmeta-validation model, drawing upon research reports published in peer-reviewed journals \nsince 2000. Through the lens of validity, we consider both the more traditional research \nthemes in the field of SET (i.e., the dimensionality debate, the ‘bias’ question, and \nquestionnaire design) and some recent trends in SET research, such as online SET and bias \ninvestigations into additional teacher personal characteristics. The review provides a clear \nidea of the state of the art with regard to research on SET, thus allowing researchers to \nformulate suggestions for future research. It is argued that SET remains a current yet delicate \ntopic in higher education, as well as in education research. Many stakeholders are not \nconvinced of the usefulness and validity of SET for both formative and summative purposes. \nResearch on SET has thus far failed to provide clear answers to several critical questions \nconcerning the validity of SET. \nUttl, White, & Gonzalez​ (2016): SETs do not indicate teaching quality, meta-analysis \nUttl, B., White, C.

However, faculty and administrators can          \noverinterpret small variations in mean teaching evaluations. The current research examined           \nthe effect of including statistical information on the interpretation of teaching evaluations.            \nStudy 1 (​N = 121) showed that faculty members interpreted small differences between mean              \ncourse evaluations even when confidence intervals and statistical tests indicated the absence            \nof meaningful differences. Study 2 (​N = 183) showed that differences labeled as             \nnonsignificant still influenced perceptions of teaching qualifications and teaching ability. The           \nresults suggest the need for increased emphasis on the use of statistics when presenting and               \ninterpreting teaching evaluation data. \nBoysen, Raesly, & Casner​ (2014): ratings are misinterpreted by faculty and administrators \nBoysen, G.

Differences in \nmeans small enough to be within the margin of error significantly impacted faculty members’ \nassignment of merit-based rewards (Study 1), department heads’ evaluation of teaching \ntechniques (Study 2) and faculty members’ evaluation of specific teaching skills (Study 3). \nThe results suggest that faculty and administrators do not apply appropriate statistical \nprinciples when evaluating teaching evaluations and instead use a general heuristic that \nhigher evaluations are better. \nFraile & Bosch-Morell​ (2015): present a reliable approach to SET interpretation \nFraile, R., & Bosch-Morell, F.

Issues in ​Accounting Education, 28​(1), 49-75. \nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.2308/iace-50302 \n[Abstract, abridged] This position paper proposes a viable alternative to higher education’s \ncurrent focus on student ratings as the primary metric for summative teaching evaluations \n(i.e., for personnel decisions). In contrast to the divergent opinions among educational \nresearchers about the validity of student ratings, a strong consensus exists that summative \nmeasures derived from the student ratings process represent a necessary rather than a \nsufficient source for evaluating teaching performance (Cashin 1990; Berk 2005). Accordingly, \nto more completely describe annual teaching performance, we propose a multisource, \nmultiple-perspective Teaching Balanced Scorecard (TBSC), fashioned from the ‘‘classic’’ \nBalanced Scorecard developed by Kaplan and Norton (1992a). The TBSC can guide \nacademic administrators to expand their conceptual view of teaching performance beyond the \nboundaries of the classroom, while coherently communicating the department’s teaching \nexpectations to the faculty; consistent with this proposition, we provide supporting evidence \nfrom a successful TBSC implementation in an academic department. \nIqbal​ (2013): faculty express concerns with peer reviews \nIqbal, I.

University faculty members were interviewed to determine their \nperceptions of the multisource method of evaluating (MME) teaching performance after a \nrevision of policies and procedures was approved. The MME is comprised of three primary \ndata sources: student evaluations, instructor reflections describing attributes of their own \nteaching such as the teaching philosophy, and a formative external review. While the faculty \nperceived the MME as a useful tool, they still believe it operates more to produce a \nsummative product than work as a formative process. According to the results, a more \nformative process would be supported by addressing several factors, including timing of \nreflections, accountability from year to year, and mentoring. Improving these constraints may \nmake the proposed MME a more appropriate tool for formative review of teaching.  \nMarsh & Roche​ (1997): multidimensional aspects of teaching should be evaluated; suggest \nnine factors \nMarsh, H.

The instrument is comprised of a teaching evaluation metric, a \nresearch evaluation metric, and a service evaluation metric. This study provides a unique \nmethod for measuring the performance of university faculty members by regressing \ncumulative student grade point average on the fraction of the total number of credit hours that \nstudents are taught by each faculty member. The study postulates that the resulting \nregression coefficients measure the average rate at which each faculty member contributes to \nstudent learning as measured by cumulative grade points earned per contact hour of \ninstruction. Since this model of teaching effectiveness is based on grades, freely assigned by \nindividual faculty members, it is a no contact, non-intrusive, non-confrontational, \nnon-threatening, non-coercive evaluation of teaching. \nStupans, McGuren, & Babey​ (2016): present a tool for analyzing free-form comments on \nratings forms \nStupans, I., McGuren, T., & Babey, A.

Attachment 1: Budget Model Principles \nPrepared by: Kathleen Brough, Senior Administrative Officer, Office of the Provost and Vice-President \n(Academic) \nUniversity of Alberta Budget Model \nPrinciples \nThe university’s budget model outlines the mechanisms and processes for allocating/re-\nallocating resources to the Faculties and units in alignment with broad institutional priorities \nand with the university’s strategic plan. The model will help inform decisions enabling the \neffective use of resources and supporting the long-term sustainability of the university’s \nfinancial position. The following principles will guide and inform the development and \napplication of the university’s budget model. \na. Supremacy of academic priorities -- the university’s mission and academic priorities as \nset out in the university’s strategic plan are paramount in all decision making. The \nbudget model will facilitate the alignment of resources in support of the university core \nmandate of teaching and research. \nb. Transparency – the process for making resource allocation decisions is transparent and \nsources of institutional resources and comparative data are clearly identified and made \navailable  \nc. Accountability -- Faculty and unit leadership have the responsibility and authority to \nmake resource allocation decisions and are accountable for achieving performance \ntargets, including financial performance targets. \nd. Simplicity -- rules and processes are understandable and actionable \ne. Consistency -- rules are applied equitably across all Faculties and units. \nf. Predictability – long-term budget planning is facilitated. Changes to the model will \nrequire consultation among the stakeholders. \nItem No. 12 \nGENERAL FACULTIES COUNCIL \nFor the Meeting of September 25, 2017 \n OUTLINE OF ISSUE \nAction Item \nAgenda Title: Faculty of Graduate Studies and Research: Proposed revisions to existing Supervision \nand Examinations policy \nMotion:  THAT General Faculties Council approve the proposed revisions to existing Supervision and \nExaminations policy, as recommended by the GFC Executive Committee and the GFC Academic Standards \nCommittee, as submitted by the Faculty of Graduate Studies and Research and as set forth in Attachment 1, \nto take effect July 1, 2018. \nItem   \nAction Requested Approval Recommendation   \nProposed by Heather Zwicker, Dean, Faculty of Graduate Studies and Research  \nPresenter Heather Zwicker, Dean, Faculty of Graduate Studies and Research \nDeborah Burshtyn, Vice-Dean, Faculty of Graduate Studies and \nResearch \nDetails \nResponsibility Provost and Vice-President (Academic) \nThe Purpose of the Proposal is \n(please be specific) \nThe revisions are intended to clarify the policies, elaborate on \nprocedures, and improve policies.  The impact will be to have greater \nclarity for students, faculty and staff in the administration and conduct \nand outcomes of examinations in thesis-based programs. \nThe Impact of the Proposal is The conduct of graduate examinations holds extremely high stakes for \nindividual students and presents significant reputational risk for the \nfaculty, program and institution. A major revision the Supervision and \nStructure of Examining Committees in the Graduate Program Manual \nwas approved by FGSR Council in May 2012. Subsequently in May 2013 \nthe authority for approval of supervisors, supervisory committees, \nexternal examiners and examining committees was delegated to the \ndisciplinary Faculty or department. The changes to the Calendar \ngoverning examinations encompassing both sets of changes was \napproved by FGSR Council October 2013 and first appeared in the \n2014-2015 Calendar.  A number of areas came to light that cause \nproblems due to apparent contradictions, gaps and/or confusing \nlanguage.  The FSGR Policy Review Committee undertook a \ncomprehensive review of the Supervision and Examination regulations.  \nThe resulting proposal addresses the organization and clarity of the \npolicy as well as changes to policy. The significant policy changes \ninclude: \n• The chair of doctoral examinations cannot be an examiner to \nremove issues of bias.  \n• One supervisor of a supervisory team must meet the employment \ncriteria of a UofA examiner. \n• Size limits for examination committees are set to prevent \nextraordinarily long examinations in light of current flexibility in \nsupervisory committee composition and the need to fulfill \nexaminer composition balance. \n• A revamped section on “Conduct of Thesis and Candidacy \nExams” was added back to provide consistency across the \nacademy. \n• Guidance was added to the outcome of “Conditional Pass” for \nItem No. 12 \nGENERAL FACULTIES COUNCIL \nFor the Meeting of September 25, 2017 \n doctoral candidacy examinations to lessen the rates of students \nnot meeting the conditions. \nReplaces/Revises (eg, policies, \nresolutions) \nRevises Supervision and Examinations policy as found in the FGSR \nsection of the Calendar. \nTimeline/Implementation Date Effective July 1, 2018. The changes will be published in the 2018-2019 \nCalendar. \nEstimated Cost and funding \nsource \nn/a \nNext Steps (ie.: \nCommunications Plan, \nImplementation plans) \nUpon final approval, an email will be sent to all members of FGSR \nCouncil that includes all Associate Deans Graduate and Graduate \nCoordinators of graduate programs, as well as the Graduate Program \nadministrators. There will be internal communication to front end FGSR \nstaff. \nSupplementary Notes and \ncontext \nThe GFC Academic Standards Committee discussed the parameters of \nwho can chair candidacy and doctoral examinations. Members \ndiscussed the role of the chair and how the proposed changes would \npreserve neutrality; the importance of having chairs with experience \nsupervising graduate students; and having chairs from outside of the \ndepartment to accommodate small departments. The committee also \nprovided comments on the requirement of a student to withdraw if no \nsupervisor was available. \nEngagement and Routing (Include meeting dates) \nParticipation: \n(parties who have seen the \nproposal and in what capacity) \n<For further information see \nthe link posted on the \nGovernance Toolkit section \nStudent Participation Protocol> \nThose who have been informed: \n•  \nThose who have been consulted: \n• Dean and Associate Deans, FGSR \n• FGSR Program Services staff \n• Graduate Program Administrators Council (GPAC) \n• Faculty Graduate Councils (or equivalents) \n• FGSR Council \n• Graduate Students Association (GSA)—represented on the PRC \n(below), also conducted wider consultation with graduate \nstudents \nThose who are actively participating: \n• FGSR Policy Review Committee (PRC) \n• Brent Epperson, Graduate Ombudsperson (as a member of PRC) \n• Graduate Students Association (GSA)—(represented on PRC \nand FGSR Council) \n• Vice Dean, FGSR \nApproval Route (Governance) \n(including meeting dates) \nFGSR Council, May 17, 2017, approved \nASC-Subcommittee on Standards - June 1, 2017 (for discussion) \nGFC Academic Standards Committee - June 15, 2017 \nGFC Executive Committee - September 11, 2017 \nGeneral Faculties Council - September 25, 2017 \nFinal Approver General Faculties Council \nhttp://www.governance.ualberta.ca/GovernanceToolkit/Toolkit.aspx\nhttp://www.governance.ualberta.ca/GovernanceToolkit/Toolkit.aspx\nItem No. 12 \nGENERAL FACULTIES COUNCIL \nFor the Meeting of September 25, 2017 \n Alignment/Compliance \nAlignment with Guiding \nDocuments \nFor the Public Good \nSustain:  \nGOAL: Sustain our people, our work, and the environment by attracting \nand stewarding the resources we need to deliver excellence to the \nbenefit of all. \n21.

It is not a University requirement for master's \nstudents to have a supervisory committee; however, some \ngraduate programs may require them. As ex-officio \nmembers of the master's final examining committee, \ndepartments should ensure that the members of the \nsupervisory committee meet the eligibility criteria as \nexaminers. \nDoctoral students \nEvery doctoral student's program shall be under the \ndirection of a supervisory committee approved by the \ndepartment. A doctoral supervisory committee must have \nat least three members, and must include all the \nsupervisors. As ex-officio members of the candidacy and \nthe doctoral final examining committees, all members of \nthe supervisory committee must meet the eligibility \ncriteria for examiners. \n[moved from below] \n The supervisory committee is chaired by one of the \nsupervisors. \nCompliance with the University of Alberta's Conflict \nPolicy - Conflict of Interest and Commitment, and \nInstitutional Conflict - is mandatory. \nThe committee will arrange for the necessary \nexaminations and for adjudication of the thesis.

At times, conflicts may \narise between a student and the supervisor. In such cases, \nthe first step must be to try to resolve the conflict or \nmisunderstanding informally. This is more likely to be \nsuccessful if attended to as early as possible. The \nsupervisor and student should discuss the problem \ntogether. The supervisor should document the \ndiscussions and keep a record of any agreements made. In \nthe event of a conflict the graduate coordinator should be \nnotified as early as possible. \nIt is the responsibility of the graduate coordinator to \narrange for consultation and mediation. The graduate \ncoordinator or the parties involved may request advice \nand/or mediation assistance from their Faculty, the FGSR, \nand/or other appropriate services, such as the Student \nOmbudservice. The student and supervisors shall not be \nrequired to participate in informal resolution against \ntheir wishes if either party's behaviour towards the other \nwarrants a complaint under the Code of Student \nBehaviour, the Discrimination and Harassment Policy, or \nother University policy. \nIf informal resolution is unsuccessful or inappropriate, \nand the graduate coordinator determines that the \nsupervisor-student relationship is beyond repair, the \ndepartment will attempt in good faith to work with the \nstudent to find alternative supervision within the \ndepartment, and will keep the FGSR apprised of these \nefforts. \nWhere the supervisor has been providing funding to the \nstudent, the funding should continue for a period of at \nleast 30 days from the date on which the graduate \ncoordinator determines that the supervisor-student \nrelationship is beyond repair. \nIf the best arrangements of the department and the FGSR \nfail to meet the expectations of the student, the student \nmay choose to withdraw without prejudice.

Members \nof these examining committees perform two functions: 1) \nthey bring disciplinary knowledge and expertise to the \nassessment of the thesis, and 2) they ensure that the \nUniversity’s expectations are met regarding the conduct \nof the examination, adherence to all relevant policies, and \nthe suitability of the thesis for the degree.  \nThe Chair  \nEvery examining committee must have a chair who is not \na supervisor but is a member of the student’s home \ndepartment. The chair should have sufficient experience \nof graduate examinations to be able to allow the \nexamination to be conducted in a fair manner, and is \nresponsible for moderating the discussion and directing \nquestions. It is the chair’s responsibility to ensure that \ndepartmental and FGSR regulations relating to the final \nexamination are followed. If the chair is not an examiner, \nthen the chair does not vote.  \nThe FGSR encourages, and for doctoral examinations \nstrongly recommends, that committee chairs not be \nexaminers.  \nExaminers  \nExaminers are full voting members of the examining \ncommittee. With the exception of the Dean, FGSR, the \nDean of the department’s Faculty, or a Pro Dean (Dean’s \nrepresentative), who may participate fully in the \nexamination, persons other than the examiners may \nattend only with the prior approval of the Dean, FGSR, the \nDean of the department’s Faculty, or the chair of the \nexamining committee. With the possible exception of the \nPro Deans, all examiners must be either active in the \ngeneral subject area of the student’s research, or bring \nrelevant expertise to the assessment of the thesis.  \nThe Role and Structure of Examining \nCommittees  \nFormal examining committees are required for thesis-\nbased master’s final examination, doctoral candidacy \nexaminations, and doctoral final examinations. Members \nof these examining committees perform two functions: 1) \nthey bring knowledge and expertise to the assessment of \nthe thesis, and 2) they ensure that the University’s \nexpectations are met regarding the conduct of the \nexamination, adherence to all relevant policies, and the \nsuitability of the thesis for the degree.  \nThe Chair  \nEvery examining committee must have a chair who is not \nthe supervisor and is a faculty member with experience \nsupervising graduate students. The chair should have \nsufficient experience of graduate examinations to be able \nto allow the examination to be conducted in a fair manner. \nThe chair is responsible for moderating the discussion \nand directing questions. It is the chair’s responsibility to \nensure that departmental and FGSR regulations relating \nto the final examination are followed. If the chair is not an \nexaminer, then the chair does not vote.  \nThe committee chair is not an examiner for doctoral \nexaminations.  See Size and Composition of Examining \nCommittees for the requirements for each examination.  \nThe chair should not have real or apparent conflict of \ninterest with the student or any of the examiners.  \nExaminers  \nExaminers are full voting members of the examining \ncommittee. All examiners must be either active in the \ngeneral subject area of the student’s research or bring \nrelevant expertise to the assessment of the thesis.  \n[Deleted sentences already found under Attendance at \nExaminations, below] \nCategories of Examiners and Eligibility \nThere are four types of examiners: ex-officio examiner, \narm’s length examiner, University of Alberta examiner \nand External examiner. \nPage 8 of 25 \nArm’s Length Examiners  \nAn arm’s length examiner must not be (or have been) a \nmember of the supervisory committee, or have been \nconnected with the thesis research in a significant way.  \nThe examiner should not have been associated with the \nstudent, outside of usual contact in courses or other non-\nthesis activities within the University, nor be related to \nthe student or supervisor(s).  \nExcept in special circumstances (fully justified in writing \nto the Dean of the department’s Faculty), an arm’s length \nexaminer should not be a close collaborator of the \nsupervisor(s) within the last six years.  \nArm’s length examiners who have served on a student’s \ncandidacy examination committee do not lose their arm’s \nlength status as a result, and are eligible to serve as arm’s \nlength examiners on the student’s doctoral final \nexamination if the other conditions of being arm’s length \nremain unchanged.  \nIn the case of a doctoral final examination, the required \nExternal (i.e., the arm’s length examiner from outside the \nUniversity of Alberta) is, by definition, an arm’s length \nexaminer. \nEvery examining committee requires a minimum number \nof arm’s length examiners: At least one for a master’s final \nexamination, at least two for a candidacy examination, \nand at least two for a doctoral final examination. \nCompliance with the University of Alberta’s Conflict Policy \n- Conflict of Interest and Commitment, and Institutional \nConflict is mandatory.  \nEx-Officio Examiners  \nThe supervisor(s), and, for doctoral students, the other \nmembers of the student’s supervisory committee, are ex-\nofficio members of the examining committee.  \nEx-officio Examiners \nThe supervisor(s) and, for doctoral students, the other \nmembers of the student’s supervisory committee are ex-\nofficio members of the examining committee. \nBy definition, no individual can be both an ex-officio and \nan arm’s length examiner on the same examining \ncommittee. \nArm’s Length Examiners  \nAn arm’s length examiner is knowledgeable in the field \nand comes fresh to the examination. They must not be (or \nhave been) a member of the supervisory committee, or \nhave been connected with the thesis research in a \nsignificant way. The examiner should not have been \nassociated with the student, outside of usual contact in \ncourses or other non-thesis activities within the \nUniversity, nor be related to the student or supervisor(s).  \nThe arm’s length examiners should not be a former \nsupervisor or student of the supervisor(s). \nExcept in special circumstances (fully justified in writing \nto the Dean of the department’s Faculty), an arm’s length \nexaminer should not be an active collaborator of the \nsupervisor(s) (see Conflict of Interest Guidelines, below ) \nArm’s length examiners who have served on a student’s \ncandidacy examination committee do not lose their arm’s \nlength status as a result, and are eligible to serve as arm’s \nlength examiners on the student’s doctoral final \nexamination if the other conditions of being arm’s length \nremain unchanged.  \nExternal Examiner \nAn external examiner from outside the University of \nAlberta is required for doctoral thesis examinations.

This minimum size condition is \nautomatically met except when the student has one \nsupervisor, no supervisory committee, and there is only \none arm’s length examiner on the examining committee. \nIn this case, the examining committee requires at least \none more examiner.  \nUniversity of Alberta Examiners \nThe University of Alberta examiner is a tenured, tenure-\ntrack, or retired University of Alberta faculty member, or \nFaculty Service Officer, (current or retired categories \nA1.1, A1.3, or current category C1.1, as defined in the \nUniversity of Alberta’s Recruitment Policy (Appendix A) \nDefinition and Categories of Academic Staff and \nColleagues). \nConflict of Interest Guidelines  for \nSupervisory and Examination Committees \nThe key relationships are: the supervisor to the student; \nthe supervisor to the other committee members; and the \nstudent to the committee members. There must be no \nconflict of interest in these relationships, as defined by the \nUniversity of Alberta policy.  Any personal or professional \nrelationships that alter or affect this academic \nrelationship may constitute a conflict of interest.  \nIt is a best practice to request examiners and the chair \ndeclare any potential conflicts of interest prior to \napproval of the examination committee.

The Examiners may seek clarification at \nthis time regarding exam procedures. \n• If academic misconduct is suspected, an Associate \nDean, FGSR should be consulted prior to the exam. \n• For thesis examinations the questioning should focus \non establishing the quality of the thesis (or thesis \nsubstitute) and the student’s breadth and depth of \nunderstanding at a level appropriate to the degree \nqualification.  Expectations for a Candidacy \nexamination are detailed in the program’s guidelines. \n• When the questions have concluded, the chair should \nask the student if they have any final comments they \nwould like to add. \nDeliberation: \n• The student is required to leave the room and will be \nasked to take their personal belongings including \nelectronic devices with them. \n• The deliberations are confidential proceedings. The \ncommittee will agree on the report to be provided to \nthe student with the outcome of the examination. \n• The examiners are asked to give their opinions on the \nquality of the thesis and the defense, or performance \nin the candidacy examination, in the same order as \nquestioning occurred. All examiners must provide \ntheir opinion before a final decision is made. \n• The options of the outcomes from the vote are \ndetailed for each type of examination. \n• If the outcome of the first vote does not result in a \ndecision (eg. two of five examiners vote to fail), the \nchair will allow for further discussion and attempt to \nreach a decision.  Only in cases where a decision \ncannot be reached in a reasonable time will the \nstudent be informed and matter referred to the Dean \nFGSR, who will determine the appropriate course of \naction. \n• The chair of the Examination Committee may sign the \nthesis examination form on behalf of an examiner \nwho is participating from a remote location.  \nThesis Based Master’s Program Examination  \nEach department offering a thesis-based Master’s degree \nis required to establish detailed examination procedures \nfor final examinations. These procedures must be made \navailable publicly.  \nDecision of the Master’s Final Examining Committee: \nThe decision of the examining committee will be based \nboth on the content of the thesis and on the student’s \nability to defend it. The final examination may result in \none of the following outcomes:  \n• Adjourned  \nPage 15 of 25 \n• Pass  \n• Pass subject to revisions  \n• Fail  \nThere is no provision for a final examination to be “passed \nsubject to major revisions”.  \nIf the Examining Committee fails to reach a decision, the \ndepartment will refer the matter to the Dean, FGSR, who \nwill determine an appropriate course of action. \nAdjourned: An adjourned examination is one that has \nbeen abandoned officially. A majority of examiners must \nagree to an outcome of Adjourned. The final examination \nshould be adjourned in the following situations:  \n• The revisions to the thesis are sufficiently substantial \nthat it will require further research or experimentation or \nmajor reworking of sections, or if the committee is so \ndissatisfied with the general presentation of the thesis \nthat it will require a reconvening of the examining \ncommittee. In such circumstances the committee cannot \npass the student, and must adjourn the examination.  \n• The committee is dissatisfied with the student’s oral \npresentation and defence of the thesis, even if the thesis \nitself is acceptable with or without minor revisions.  \n• Compelling, extraordinary circumstances such as a \nsudden medical emergency taking place during the \nexamination.  \n• Discovery of possible offences under the Code of Student \nBehaviour after the examination has started.  \nIf the examination is adjourned, the committee should:  \n• Specify in writing to the student, with as much precision \nas possible, the nature of the deficiencies and, in the case \nof revisions to the thesis, the extent of the revisions \nrequired. Where the oral defence is unsatisfactory, it may \nbe necessary to arrange some discussion periods with the \nstudent prior to reconvening the examination.  \n• Decide upon a date to reconvene. If the date of the \nreconvened examination depends upon the completion of \na research task or a series of discussions, it should be \nmade clear which committee members will decide on the \nappropriate date to reconvene.

Also, a proposed External must not have had an \nassociation within the last six years with the doctoral \nstudent’s supervisor (as a former student, supervisor, or \nclose collaborator, for instance).  \nUnder normal circumstances the same person will not be \nused as an External at the University of Alberta if that \nExternal has served in the same capacity in the same \ndepartment at this University within the preceding two \nyears; this does not preclude an External serving in \nanother department.  \nOnce the External has been approved an official letter of \ninvitation is issued to the External by the department.  \nApproval of the Doctoral Final Examining Committee: \nThe department will recommend the names of all \nmembers of the final examining committee and forward \nthem to the Dean of the department’s Faculty, if decanal \napproval is required, following the procedures \nestablished by their Faculty.  \nExternal Readers: Do not attend the examination. \nInstead, the External Reader is asked in the letter of \ninvitation to prepare a written report consisting of:  \n• an evaluation of the scope, structure, methodology, and \nfindings of the thesis,  \n• a list of minor errors (if any), and  \n• either a list of clear, direct, contextualized questions to \nbe posed to the candidate during the examination, or a \nbrief written commentary of the thesis which can be read \nto the candidate for response during the examination.  \nThe External Reader must include a statement that the \nthesis falls into one of the following two categories:  \n• Acceptable with minor or no revisions: In this case, \nthe External Reader submits the report to the Graduate \nPage 22 of 25 \nCoordinator at least one week before the examination. If \nthe External Reader considers the thesis to be of a calibre \nworthy of consideration for an award, the External \nReader comments on this in the written evaluation; or  \n• Unacceptable without major revisions: In this case, \nthe External Reader contacts the Dean of the FGSR \nimmediately by email as the examination may need to be \npostponed.  \nThe questions or commentary will be made available to \nthe student for the first time during the examination and \nthe committee will evaluate the student’s answers as part \nof the examination.  \nExternal Examiners: Attend the examination in person. \nIn the letter of invitation, the External Examiner is \nrequested to prepare and send to the Graduate \nCoordinator, at least one week in advance of the \nexamination, an evaluation of the thesis placing it \ntemporarily in one of the following categories:  \n• the thesis is acceptable with minor or no revisions,  \n• the External Examiner wishes to reserve judgment until \nafter the examination, or  \n• the thesis is unacceptable without major revisions.  \nIn the first two cases, the External Examiner is asked to \nprovide a brief written commentary (approximately two \nto three pages) on the structure, methodology, quality, \nsignificance and findings of the thesis for the reference of \nboth the student and supervisor. The commentary should \nnot be given to the student prior to the examination. \nIf the thesis is judged by the External Examiner to fall into \nthe “Unacceptable” category, then the External Examiner \nis asked to contact the Dean of the FGSR immediately, \nsince the final examination may have to be postponed.  \nThe Examination: The examining committee should \nconduct a final examination, based largely on the thesis. \nThe graduate coordinator should ensure that the chair of \nthe examining committee, the student, and all examiners \nhave a final copy of the thesis at the examination.  \nThe student should make a brief presentation about the \nthesis.  \nThe most time should be allotted to the arm’s length \nexaminers, including the External Examiner, while the \nleast time is allocated to the supervisor(s).  \nNo final decision should be made without each examiner \nhaving given an opinion.  \nDecision of the Doctoral Final Examining Committee: The \ndecision of the examining committee will be based both \non the content of the thesis and on the student’s ability to \ndefend it. The final examination may result in one of the \nfollowing outcomes:  \n• Adjourned  \n• Pass  \n• Pass subject to revisions  \nCoordinator at least one week before the examination.

A major revision the Supervision and \nStructure of Examining Committees in the Graduate Program Manual was approved by FGSR Council in May \n2012. Subsequently in May 2013 the authority for approval of supervisors, supervisory committees, \nexternal examiners and examining committees was delegated to the disciplinary department/Faculty of the \nprogram and the change to the Calendar governing examinations was approved by FGSR Council October \n2013 appearing in the 2014-2015 Calendar.  A number of areas have come to light that have caused \nproblems due to apparent contradictions, gaps and/or confusing language.  The revisions are not intended \nto significantly alter the policies governing examinations but to clarify the policies, elaborate on procedures, \nand update graduate level examination procedures given changes to practices and technologies. \nApproved: FGSR Council, May 17, 2017 \nItem No. 13 \nGENERAL FACULTIES COUNCIL \nFor the Meeting of September 25, 2017 \n OUTLINE OF ISSUE \nAction Item \nAgenda Title: Proposed Faculty Name Change: Faculty of Kinesiology, Sport, and Recreation (from \nFaculty of Physical Education and Recreation (FPER)) \nMotion:  THAT General Faculties Council approve the proposed name change for the Faculty of Physical \nEducation and Recreation to the ‘Faculty of Kinesiology, Sport, and Recreation’, as submitted by the \nDean of the Faculty, to take effect upon final approval. \nItem   \nAction Requested Approval Recommendation   \nProposed by Kerry Mummery, Dean, Faculty of Physical Education & Recreation \nPresenter Kerry Mummery, Dean, Faculty of Physical Education & Recreation \nDetails \nResponsibility Provost and Vice-President (Academic) \nThe Purpose of the Proposal is \n(please be specific) \nTo change the name of the Faculty of FPER to a name that more \naccurately depicts its academic mission and offerings, in support of \nattracting the best and brightest students and faculty, and being \nrecognized as a leader among its peers. Over the past academic year \nFPER Faculty members, staff, students, alumni and stakeholders were \ngiven the opportunity to provide input on a new Faculty name. After a \nformal process Faculty Council endorsed the name Faculty of \nKinesiology, Sport, and Recreation. \nThe Impact of the Proposal is The new Faculty name better defines and describes the teaching, \nresearch and service activities of the Faculty. The new name will both \ndefine and differentiate the Faculty at the national and international level, \nthus helping to attract top quality students, faculty and staff. \nReplaces/Revises (eg, policies, \nresolutions) \nCurrent name:  Faculty of Physical Education and Recreation. \nTimeline/Implementation Date Effective upon approval. \nEstimated Cost and funding \nsource \nThe estimated cost of name change is approximately $250,000, which \nincludes costs related to signage inside and outside of all Faculty \nbuildings on North and South Campus, the update of all Faculty-named \nmedia, marketing and promotional material, and well as a dedicated \nmarketing and communication plan to promote the new name locally, \nprovincially, nationally, and internationally. Funds to support the costs of \nthe name change will come from the Faculty, the Office of the Provost \nand Vice-President (Academic), and the Office of the Vice President \nUniversity Relations. \nNext Steps (ie.: \nCommunications Plan, \nImplementation plans) \nOn final approval by GFC, the Marketing and Communication office in \nthe Faculty will complete both a ‘soft’ and ‘hard’ launch of the new \nFaculty name. The soft launch will immediately begin using the new \nFaculty name on any item that allows for immediate alteration (i.e. email \nsignatures, newly created Faculty documents, etc.). The soft launch will \noccur immediately following approval by GFC. The hard launch of the \nnew Faculty name will take place when all of the marketing, media, \npromotional material and way-finding signage are prepared. Upon hard \nlaunch all references to the former Faculty name will be removed, and \nthe former Faculty name will only be used in the historical context. \nSupplementary Notes and \ncontext \nItem No. 13 \nGENERAL FACULTIES COUNCIL \nFor the Meeting of September 25, 2017 \nEngagement and Routing (Include meeting dates) \nParticipation: \n(parties who have seen the \nproposal and in what capacity) \n<For further information see \nthe link posted on the \nGovernance Toolkit section \nStudent Participation Protocol> \nThose who have been informed: \n• Canadian Council of University Physical Education and \nKinesiology Administrators (CCUPEKA) \n• Presidential Visiting Committee (PVC) \n• International Partner Universities  \nThose who have been consulted: \n• Faculty staff, students, and alumni \n• Physical Education and Recreation Council of Students (PERCS) \n• Physical Education and Recreation and Recreation Graduate \nStudents Society (PERGGS) \n• Physical Education and Recreation Alumni Associate (PERRA) \n• Community stakeholders \nThose who are actively participating: \n• Faculty of Physical Education and Recreation Academic Planning \nCommittee \n• Faculty of Physical Education and Recreation Faculty \nManagement Group (APC) \n• Faculty of Physical Education and Recreation Faculty Council \nExecutive Committee (FEXC) \n• Faculty of Physical Education and Recreation Faculty Council \nApproval Route (Governance) \n(including meeting dates) \nFaculty of Physical Education and Recreation Council  \nGFC Academic Planning Committee – September 13, 2017 \nGFC Executive Committee (for information) – September 11, 2017 \nGeneral Faculties Council – September 25, 2017 \nFinal Approver General Faculties Council \nAlignment/Compliance \nAlignment with Guiding \nDocuments \nThe name Faculty of Kinesiology, Sport, and Recreation will position \nthe Faculty to ‘build a diverse, inclusive community of exceptional \nundergraduate and graduate students from Edmonton, Alberta, Canada \nand the world’ (Institutional Strategic Plan 2016 – 2021, Objective 1) by \nbetter describing the areas of research, teaching and service. The \nunique-in-Canada inclusion of the term ‘sport’ in the faculty name will \noffer a point of differentiation on the international scene, whereas the \nreplacement of the name Physical Education with Kinesiology aligns the \nofferings of the Faculty with our domestic competitors. The renaming of \nthe Faculty will address Objective 6 of the Institution Plan, by developing \na ‘brand platform’ that will enhance our reputation, image and identity. \nThe renaming of the Faculty aligns the name/brand of the Faculty with its \nmission and mandate, which is to ‘create and share (sic) the best \nunderstandings and applications of physical activity, sport and recreation \nfor the public good’ (Faculty Strategic Plan 2016-2021). Consistent and \naligned with the Institutional plan, the renaming of the Faculty positions \nthe Faculty to Recruit and enroll high quality students and increase the \nnumber of out-of-province and international students in the Faculty \n(aligns with Faculty Strategic Plan; Build). Additionally, the proposed \nname of the Faculty aligns with Engage under the Faculty Strategic Plan, \nwhich seeks to ‘increase and depend the understanding’ of the Faculty. \nhttp://www.governance.ualberta.ca/GovernanceToolkit/Toolkit.aspx\nhttp://www.governance.ualberta.ca/GovernanceToolkit/Toolkit.aspx\nItem No. 13 \nGENERAL FACULTIES COUNCIL \nFor the Meeting of September 25, 2017 \n Compliance with Legislation, \nPolicy and/or Procedure \nRelevant to the Proposal \n(please quote legislation and \ninclude identifying section \nnumbers) \n1.

Clearly, the \nFaculty’s name is a historic name associated with much success. However, \nthe PVC considered the name as unsuited for increased international \nvisibility and attracting international students. Therefore, the PVC \nrecommended changing the Faculty Name.  \nAs the PVC learned the Faculty entered a process to review and rename the \nFaculty. As a result of this process a change of name to “ Faculty of \nKinesiology, Sport, and Recreation” was suggested by the Faculty Council.  \nThe (PVC) is convinced that this name change is in line with the development \nof the Faculty and will contribute to an advancement in recruitment, branding, \nand internationalization. Therefore, the PVC very much supports the \nproposed change of name for the Faculty of Physical Education and \nRecreation at the University of Alberta. \nMunich, August 1, 2017 \nJürgen Beckmann \nChair of the President’s Visiting Committee \nPresident of the University of Alberta \nDr. David H.
